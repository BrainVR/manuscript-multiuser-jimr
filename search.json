These were merged and 987 duplicates were found during this automated process. This left a 1636 papers to be screened.\nThese were prescanned by 5 researchers, each receiving a portion of the dataset and considering the inclusion of the paper based on its title, keywords and abstract. In this phase, we included even papers with weak links to the topic, to be later fully considered in the second full text search. Papers were discarded based on various criteria, mainly if they were not focusing on mental health, but rather physical therapy, not offering digital therapy, not being multi user, targetting very limited ungeneralizable populations, being protocols of studies, not conducted studies etc. This preliminary search left us with 313 papers.\nThese papers were each considered by five researchers, each receiving them in a random order. The researchers studied the fulltext of the paper and categorized it similarly to previous criteria (e.g. not offering multi user experience, focusing on limited populations). If a paper received three positive votes for inclusion, it was kept in the final review, if it received 3 negative points, it was excluded. Articles with two points for and two against were again addressed as a group (this included 26 papers) and another 5 papers were added.\nThe final sample included 50 papers and 45 reviews. The reviews were not included in the qualitative synthesis.\n\n\n\nprisma(found = n_found,\n       found_other = 0,\n       no_dupes = n_screened,\n       screened = n_screened,\n       screen_exclusions = n_phase1_dropped,\n       full_text = n_phase1_kept,\n       full_text_exclusions = n_phase2_dropped,\n       qualitative = n_phase3_kept_notreviews)\n\nWarning in prisma_graph(found = found, found_other = found_other, no_dupes =\nno_dupes, : After full-text exclusions, a different number of remaining\narticles for qualitative synthesis is stated."
