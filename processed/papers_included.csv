Online group music therapy: proactive management of undergraduate students' stress and anxiety,"Finnerty, R; McWeeny, S; Trainor, L",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2023,"IntroductionIn alignment with the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal to provide comprehensive and integrated mental health services in community-based settings, this randomized control trial explored the efficacy of online group music therapy as a proactive intervention for reducing stress and anxiety in university students who do not necessarily have a diagnosis. MethodsThe study took place during COVID-19 restrictions. Students who volunteered were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of weekly (1) online active group music therapy, (2) online receptive group music therapy, (3) online group verbal therapy (standard of care), or (4) no-intervention (control group). Students rated their stress (Likert scale) and anxiety [State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, State version (STAI-S)], and provided heart rate variability (HRV) using a phone app, pre and post each therapy session. ResultsSTAI-S and Likert stress scores significantly reduced from pre to post 45-min online music therapy sessions, with moderate evidence that these changes did not differ from the standard of care (verbal therapy). HRV results were not analyzed statistically as HRV collection was likely compromised due to challenges of remote collection. Students completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and provided a hair sample for cortisol analysis before and after the 6-week intervention. Changes in stress from week 1 to week 6 were not observed in the PSS measure; however, cortisol increased significantly in the control group as the term progressed, while it remained relatively stable in the therapy groups, suggesting therapy may lead to greater control of stress. Of participants' demographic characteristics, music sophistication, personality, and changes in quality of life, only the personality trait of conscientiousness correlated significantly with PSS, suggesting online group therapy may be beneficial for a wide range of university students. DiscussionThe results suggest group music therapy can be as effective as group verbal therapy. Further, the study indicates that online delivery can be achieved effectively, supporting the idea that remote therapy may be a viable option for other populations. While the study should be replicated with a larger multi-site sample, it provides one example toward achieving a health-promoting culture on university campuses, consistent with the mental health goals of the Okanagan Charter.",10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1183311,Psychiatry,mental health; music therapy; stress; anxiety; proactive therapy; cortisol; university students; online group therapy,3,3,1,Video conference,Monitor,3+,Professional
A virtual mother-infant postpartum psychotherapy group for mothers with a history of adverse childhood experiences: open-label feasibility study,"Wright, E; Martinovic, J; Meschino, DD; Barker, LC; Philipp, DA; Israel, A; Hussain-Shamsy, N; Mukerji, G; Wang, V; Chatterjee, A; Vigod, SN",BMC PSYCHIATRY,2023,"ObjectivesMothers with a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are at elevated risk for postpartum mental illness and impairment in the mother-infant relationship. Interventions attending to maternal-infant interactions may improve outcomes for these parents and their children, but barriers to accessing in-person postpartum care limit uptake. We adapted a postpartum psychotherapy group for mothers with mental illness (e.g., mood, anxiety, trauma-related disorders) and ACE for live video-based delivery, and evaluated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in an open-label pilot study.MethodsWe recruited adults with children (6-18 months) from a perinatal psychiatry program in Toronto, Canada. The intervention was a live video-based 12-week interactive psychotherapy group focused on maternal symptoms and maternal-infant relationships. The primary outcome was feasibility, including feasibility of recruitment and retention, fidelity of the intervention, and acceptability to patients and group providers. Maternal clinical outcomes were compared pre- to post-intervention, as secondary outcomes.ResultsWe recruited 31 participants (mean age 36.5 years (SD 3.9)) into 6 groups; 93.6% (n = 29) completed post-group questionnaires, and n = 20 completed an optional post-group acceptability interview. Mean weekly group attendance was 83% (IQR 80-87); one participant (3.2%) dropped out. All group components were implemented as planned, except for dyadic exercises where facilitator observation of dyads was replaced with unobserved mother-infant exercises followed by in-group reflection. Participant acceptability was high (100% indicated the virtual group was easy to access, beneficial, and reduced barriers to care). Mean maternal depressive [Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale: 14.6 (SD 4.2) vs. 11.8 (SD 4.2), paired t, p = 0.005] and post-traumatic stress [Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5: 35.5 (SD 19.0) vs. 27.1 (SD 16.7)], paired t, p = 0.01] symptoms were significantly lower post vs. pre-group. No differences were observed on mean measures of anxiety, emotion regulation or parenting stress.ConclusionsRecruitment and retention met a priori feasibility criteria. There were significant pre- to post-group reductions in maternal depressive and post-traumatic symptoms, supporting proceeding to larger-scale implementation and evaluation of the intervention, with adaptation of dyadic exercises.",10.1186/s12888-023-05444-x,Psychiatry,Maternal-child; Mental health; Adverse childhood experiences,3,3,1,Video conference,Monitor,3+,"Peer ,Professional"
A Digital Peer Support Platform to Translate Online Peer Support for Emerging Adult Mental Well-being: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Yeo, G; Loo, G; Oon, M; Pang, R; Ho, D",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2023,"Background: Emerging adulthood (ages 19 to 25 years) is a developmental phase that is marked by increased mental health conditions, especially depression and anxiety. A growing body of work indicates that digital peer emotional support has positive implications for the psychological functioning of emerging adults. There is burgeoning interest among health care professionals, educational stakeholders, and policy makers in understanding the implementation and clinical effectiveness, as well as the associated mechanism of change, of digital peer support as an intervention.Objective: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the effectiveness of a digital peer support intervention over a digital platform-Acceset-for emerging adult psychological well-being with 3 primary aims. First, we evaluated the implementation effectiveness of digital peer support training for individuals providing support (befrienders) and of the digital platform for peer support. Second, we assessed the clinical outcomes of digital peer support in terms of the intervening effect on emerging adult psychological well-being. Third, we investigated the mechanism of change linking the digital peer support intervention to emerging adult psychological well-being.Methods: This RCT involving 100 emerging adults from the National University of Singapore follows the published protocol for this trial.Results: This RCT found effectiveness in digital peer support training-specifically, befrienders' peer support responses demonstrating significantly higher post-than pretraining scores in selfhood (posttraining score: mean 62.83, SD 10.18, and SE 1.72; pretraining score: mean 54.86, SD 7.32, and SE 1.24; t34=3.88; P<.001). The digital peer support intervention demonstrated clinical effectiveness in enhancing selfhood, compassion, and mindfulness and lowering depressive and anxiety symptoms among seekers in the intervention group after the intervention (mean 7.15, SD 5.14; SE 0.88) than among seekers in the waitlist control group before the intervention (mean 11.75, SD 6.72; SE 0.89; t89=3.44; P<.001). The effect of the intervention on seekers' psychological well-being was sustained beyond the period of the intervention. The mechanism of change revealed that seekers' engagement with the intervention had both immediate and prospective implications for their psychological well-being.Conclusions: This RCT of a digital peer support intervention for emerging adult psychological well-being harnesses the interventional potential of 4 components of psychological well-being and elucidated a mechanism of change. By incorporating and validating the digital features and process of a peer support platform, our RCT provides the parameters and conditions for deploying an effective and novel digital peer support intervention for emerging adult psychological well-being in real-world settings.",10.2196/43956,Psychiatry,mental health; digital health; peer support intervention; peer emotional disclosure; randomized controlled trial,3,3,1,Text,Not specified,2,"Peer ,Professional"
Evaluation of a Technology-Based Peer-Support Intervention Program for Preventing Postnatal Depression (Part 1): Randomized Controlled Trial,"Shorey, S; Chee, CYI; Ng, ED; Lau, Y; Dennis, CL; Chan, YH",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: The frenzy of postbirth events often takes a toll on mothers' mental well-being, leaving them susceptible to postpartum psychological disorders such as postnatal depression (PND). Social support has been found to be effective in restoring the emotional well-being of new mothers. Therefore, mothers need to be supported during the crucial postpartum period to buffer the negative after effects of childbirth and to promote healthier maternal well-being. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a technology-based peer-support intervention program (PIP) on maternal outcomes during the early postpartum period. Methods: A randomized, parallel-armed controlled trial was conducted. The study recruited 138 mothers (69 in intervention group, 69 in control group) at risk of PND from a tertiary hospital in Singapore. To support these mothers, 20 peer volunteers were recruited by word of mouth and trained by a psychiatrist in social support skills before the intervention commenced. The 4-week-long intervention included a weekly follow-up with a peer volunteer through phone calls or text messages. The intervention group received peer support in addition to the standard care offered by the hospital. The control group only received postnatal standard care. Maternal outcomes (PND, postnatal anxiety [PNA], loneliness, and perceived social support) were measured with reliable and valid instruments. Data were collected immediately postpartum, at 1 month postpartum and at 3 months postpartum. The general linear model was used to compare the groups for postpartum percentage changes in the outcome variables at first and third months, and the linear mixed model was used to compare the trend over the study period. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores (d=-2.11; 95% CI -4.0 to -0.3; P=.03) between the intervention and control groups at 3 months postpartum after adjusting for covariates. The intervention group had a significant change over time compared with the control group. Conclusions: The technology-based PIP was found to be effective in reducing the risk of PND among new mothers and showed a generally positive trend in reducing PNA and loneliness and increasing perceived social support. This study highlights the importance of training paraprofessionals to provide needed support for new mothers postpartum. A further long-term evaluation of the PIP on maternal and family outcomes and its cost-effectiveness is needed to inform clinical practices.",10.2196/12410,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,anxiety; loneliness; postpartum depression; social support; technology; digital health; peer support; peer-to-peer support; online support groups; internet,2,4,0.5,"Video conference,Text,Voice conferences",Not specified,2,"Peer "
Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM): an open-pilot and feasibility study of a digital mental health and parenting intervention for mothers of infants,"Xie, EB; Freeman, M; Penner-Goeke, L; Reynolds, K; Lebel, C; Giesbrecht, GF; Rioux, C; MacKinnon, A; Sauer-Zavala, S; Roos, LE; Tomfohr-Madsen, L",PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES,2023,"Background Maternal mental health concerns and parenting stress in the first few years following childbirth are common and pose significant risks to maternal and child well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increases in maternal depression and anxiety and has presented unique parenting stressors. Although early intervention is crucial, there are significant barriers to accessing care.Methods To inform a larger randomized controlled trial, the current open-pilot trial investigated initial evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a newly developed online group therapy and app-based mental health and parenting program (BEAM) for mothers of infants. Forty-six mothers 18 years or older with clinically elevated depression scores, with an infant aged 6-17 months old, and who lived in Manitoba or Alberta were enrolled in the 10-week program (starting in July 2021) and completed self-report surveys.Results The majority of participants engaged in each of the program components at least once and participants indicated relatively high levels of app satisfaction, ease of use, and usefulness. However, there was a high level of attrition (46%). Paired-sample t-tests indicated significant pre- to post-intervention change in maternal depression, anxiety, and parenting stress, and in child internalizing, but not externalizing symptoms. Effect sizes were in the medium to high range, with the largest effect size observed for depressive symptoms (Cohen's d = .93).Discussion This study shows moderate levels of feasibility and strong preliminary efficacy of the BEAM program.

South African university students' experiences of online group cognitive behavioural therapy: Implications for delivering digital mental health interventions to young people,"Hunt, X; Jivan, DC; Naslund, JA; Breet, E; Bantjes, J",CAMBRIDGE PRISMS-GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH,2023,"Mental disorders are common among university students. In the face of a large treatment gap, resource constraints and low uptake of traditional in-person psychotherapy services by students, there has been interest in the role that digital mental health solutions could play in meeting students' mental health needs. This study is a cross-sectional, qualitative inquiry into university students' experiences of an online group cognitive behavioural therapy (GCBT) intervention. A total of 125 respondents who had participated in an online GCBT intervention completed a qualitative questionnaire, and 12 participated in in-depth interviews. The findings provide insights into how the context in which the intervention took place, students' need for and expectations about the intervention; and the online format impacted their engagement and perception of its utility. The findings of this study also suggest that, while online GCBT can capitalise on some of the strengths of both digital and in-person approaches to mental health programming, it also suffers from some of the weaknesses of both digital delivery and those associated with in-person therapies.",10.1017/gmh.2023.39,Psychiatry,digital mental health; cognitive behavioural therapy; university students; mHealth; group therapy,3,3,1,"Video conference,Text",Monitor,3+,"Peer ,Professional"
"AFFIRM Online: Utilising an Affirmative Cognitive-Behavioural Digital Intervention to Improve Mental Health, Access, and Engagement among LGBTQA plus Youth and Young Adults","Craig, SL; Leung, VWY; Pascoe, R; Pang, N; Iacono, G; Austin, A; Dillon, F",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,2021,"Digital mental health interventions may enable access to care for LGBTQA+ youth and young adults that face significant threats to their wellbeing. This study describes the preliminary efficacy of AFFIRM Online, an eight-session manualised affirmative cognitive behavioural group intervention delivered synchronously. Participants (M-age = 21.17; SD = 4.52) had a range of sexual (e.g., queer, lesbian, pansexual) and gender (e.g., non-binary, transgender, cisgender woman) identities. Compared to a waitlist control (n = 50), AFFIRM Online participants (n = 46) experienced significantly reduced depression (b = -5.30, p = 0.005, d = 0.60) and improved appraisal of stress as a challenge (b = 0.51, p = 0.005, d = 0.60) and having the resources to meet those challenges (b = 0.27, p = 0.059, d = 0.39) as well active coping (b = 0.36, p = 0.012, d = 0.54), emotional support (b = 0.38, p = 0.017, d = 0.51), instrumental support (b = 0.58, p < 0.001, d = 0.77), positive framing (b = 0.34, p = 0.046, d = 0.42), and planning (b = 0.41, p = 0.024, d = 0.49).

Promoting psychological health in women with SCI: Development of an online self-esteem intervention,"Robinson-Whelen, S; Hughes, RB; Taylor, HB; Markley, R; Vega, JC; Nosek, TM; Nosek, MA",DISABILITY AND HEALTH JOURNAL,2020,"Background: There are no known interventions addressing self-esteem in women following spinal cord injury (SCI). Objectives: To test the feasibility of an online self-esteem intervention for women with disabilities, as modified for women with SCI. Method: We conducted a randomized, controlled feasibility test of a self-esteem intervention (N = 21). Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group that received intervention materials at the end of the study. Intervention participants met as avatars for 7 weekly real-time group sessions in Second Life (SL), a free online virtual world. Feasibility indicators were study engagement, acceptability of SL and the intervention, and improvements on measures of psychological health promoting behaviors, social support, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and depression. Results: Intervention participants (n = 10) were highly engaged, and most described the SL program as more enjoyable and more convenient than in-person programs. All rated the intervention as good (n = 4) or very good (n = 6), and all 10 rated themselves has having made positive life changes as a result of the program. Intervention participants experienced significantly greater change than controls on two measures of health-promoting behavior (Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile-II Spiritual Growth/Self-actualization; Interpersonal Relations). Examining change in the intervention group using regression analyses, we found medium-to-large effects of the intervention on these behaviors and measures of depression (CESD-10, PHQ-9). The intervention had small effects on remaining measures. Conclusion: We found preliminary support for the feasibility of this modified self-esteem intervention offered in SL. Such programming may help circumvent barriers to community-based psychological services and may improve psychological health. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Can We Foster a Culture of Peer Support and Promote Mental Health in Adolescence Using a Web-Based App? A Control Group Study,"Bohleber, L; Crameri, A; Eich-Stierli, B; Telesko, R; von Wyl, A",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2016,"Background: Adolescence with its many transitions is a vulnerable period for the development of mental illnesses. Establishing effective mental health promotion programs for this age group is a challenge crucial to societal health. Programs must account for the specific developmental tasks that adolescents face. Considering peer influence and fostering adolescent autonomy strivings is essential. Participation in a program should be compelling to young people, and their affinity to new technologies offers unprecedented opportunities in this respect. Objective: The Companion App was developed as a Web-based app giving adolescents access to a peer mentoring system and interactive, health-relevant content to foster a positive peer culture among adolescents and thereby strengthen social support and reduce stress. Methods: In a control group study design, a group of employed (n=546) and unemployed (n=73) adolescents had access to the Companion App during a 10-month period. The intervention was evaluated using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze changes in chronic stress levels and perception of social support. Monthly feedback on the app and qualitative interviews at the end of the study allowed for an in-depth exploration of the adolescents' perception of the intervention. Results: Adolescents in the intervention group did not use the Companion App consistently. The intervention had no significant effect on chronic stress levels or the perception of social support. Adolescents reported endorsing the concept of the app and the implementation of a peer mentoring system in particular. However, technical difficulties and insufficiently obvious benefits of using the app impeded more frequent usage. Conclusions: The Companion Project implemented a theory-driven and innovative approach to mental health promotion in adolescence, taking into account the specifics of this developmental phase. Particularities of the implementation context, technical aspects of the app, and insufficient incentives may have played considerable roles concerning the difficulties of the Companion Project to establish commitment. However, adopting peer mentoring as a strategy and using an app still seems to us a promising approach in mental health promotion in adolescents. Future projects should be careful to invest enough resources into the technical development of an app and consider a large use of incentives to establish commitment. When targeting risk groups, such as unemployed adolescents, it may be expedient to use more structured approaches including face-to-face support.",10.2196/mental.5597,Psychiatry,mental health; health promotion; mobile applications; adolescence; peer group; mentors,3,3,1,Text,Mobile,3+,"Professional,Peer "
Increasing engagement with an occupational digital stress management program through the use of an online facilitated discussion group: Results of a pilot randomised controlled trial,"Carolan S, Harris PR, Greenwood K, Cavanagh K.",Internet Interv,2017,"Introduction: Rates of work-related stress, depression and anxiety are high, resulting in reduced work performance and absenteeism. There is evidence that digital mental health interventions delivered in the workplace are an effective way of treating these conditions, but intervention engagement and adherence remain a challenge. Providing guidance can lead to greater engagement and adherence; an online facilitated discussion group may be one way of providing that guidance in a time efficient way. This study compares engagement with a minimally guided digital mental health program (WorkGuru) delivered in the workplace with a discussion group (DG) and without a discussion group (MSG), and with a wait list control (WLC); it was conducted as a pilot phase of a definitive trial.

Methods: Eighty four individuals with elevated levels of stress from six organisations were recruited to the study and randomised to one of two active conditions (DG or MSG) or a WLC. The program WorkGuru is a CBT based, eight-week stress management intervention that is delivered with minimal guidance from a coach. Data was collected at baseline, post-intervention and at 16-week follow-up via online questionnaires. The primary outcome measure was number of logins. Secondary measures included further engagement measures, and measures of depression, anxiety, stress, comfort and enthusiasm. Quality measures including satisfaction and system usability were also collected.

Results: A greater number of logins was observed for the DG compared with the MSG; this was a medium between group effect size (d = 0.51; 95% CI: - 0.04, 1.05). Small to medium effect size differences were found at T2 in favour of the active conditions compared with the control on the DASS subscales depression, anxiety and stress, and the IWP subscales enthusiasm and comfort. This was largely maintained at T3. Satisfaction with the intervention was high with individuals in the MSG reporting greater satisfaction than individuals in the DG.

Conclusions: This study shows that access to an online facilitated discussion group increases engagement with a minimally supported occupational digital mental health intervention (as defined by the number of logins), but that this doesn't necessarily result in improved psychological outcomes or increased satisfaction when compared to access to the intervention without the group. Access to the web-based program was associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress and an increase in comfort and enthusiasm post intervention; these changes were largely maintained at follow-up.",10.1016/j.invent.2017.08.001,NA,NA,3,3,1,Text,"Mobile,Monitor",3+,"Peer ,Professional"
Traditional versus virtual partial hospital programme for eating disorders: Feasibility and preliminary comparison of effects,"Penwell, TE; Smith, M; Ortiz, SN; Brooks, G; Thompson-Brenner, H",EUROPEAN EATING DISORDERS REVIEW,2024,"Objective: Minimal research has examined teletherapy for group or intensive eating disorder (ED) treatment, particularly partial hospital programme (PHP). This study compared treatment outcomes for individuals treated before and after a pandemic-driven implementation of virtual PHP.Method: Patients received care at ED treatment centres using the Renfrew Unified Treatment for Eating Disorders and Comorbidity. Patients treated with virtual PHP were compared to patients treated with traditional PHP. Measures of ED symptomology and behaviours, depressive symptoms, anxiety severity, anxiety sensitivity, experiential avoidance, mindfulness, and body mass index (BMI; reported for anorexia nervosa [AN] patients only) were collected at intake and discharge. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of treatment group on outcomes, controlling for intake score, comorbidity, discharge status, AN diagnosis, and step-down status.Results: Differences in treatment type were only found for binge eating frequency, with those in virtual PHP reporting significantly lower binge eating episodes at discharge than those in traditional PHP. Body mass index showed significantly less improvement in virtual PHP than in traditional PHP.Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest virtual PHP is feasible and effective, potentially increasing access to evidence-based, intensive ED treatment.

"Mixed Reality, Full-Body Interactive Experience to Encourage Social Initiation for Autism: Comparison with a Control Nondigital Intervention","Crowell, C; Sayis, B; Benitez, JP; Pares, N",CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING,2020,"Despite a proliferation in digital intervention tools for autism, many studies lack comparison with standard intervention tools, and are not evaluated with objective and standardized measures. In this article, we present research on the potential of mixed reality (MR) experiences using full-body interaction to foster social initiation behaviors in children with autism while playing with a child without autism, in a face-to-face colocated configuration. The primary goal was to test whether practicing socialization in a virtual environment catered toward individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) could be a way to reduce anxiety while simultaneously forming collaborative behavioral patterns. Building on the results of a preliminary study, this second phase compares our system with a typical LEGO social intervention strategy using construction tools and toys as an aid to the psychologist, therapist, or caregiver. Results are based on four data sources: (a) video coding of the externally observed behaviors during the video-recorded play sessions, (b) log files of our system showing the events triggered and the real-time decisions taken, (c) physiologic data (heart rate variability and electrodermal activity) gathered through child-appropriate wearable, (d) and a standardized anxiety questionnaire.

Patients' experiences with virtual group gut-directed hypnotherapy: A qualitative study,"Gerson, J; Tawde, P; Ghiasian, G; Salwen-Deremer, JK",FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE,2023,"BackgroundHypnotherapy is a useful treatment for a variety of gastrointestinal conditions. While there is strong evidence for delivering other treatments virtually and in groups, there is no research thus far on delivering hypnotherapy in this format. Given the growth of both psychogastroenterology and telehealth, these methods should be explored as they have great potential for increasing access and cost-effectiveness of intervention. AimsThis qualitative study was developed to help understand patients experiences in virtual, group-based, gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) in two different institutions. MethodsAuthors developed a qualitative interview with the assistance of two patient partners and then recruited patients from New York University and Dartmouth Health to participate. Interviews were completed one-on-one with patients who started and then completed GDH (>= 5 visits) and who did not complete GDH (<= 3 visits). Data were coded and then analyzed using thematic analysis. ResultsTwenty-one patients from NYU and Dartmouth participated in qualitative interviews. Broadly, patients reported coming to GDH because they believed in the importance of the mind-body connection or were desperate for treatment. Regardless of why patients came to GDH, they generally reported positive outcomes for GI symptoms and for other physical and mental health conditions. Most patients appreciated the group and virtual formats, though some concerns about inflexible schedules and lack of anonymity were voiced. Despite these concerns, there was broad support for virtual, group-based GDH and general excitement for behavioral health programming. ConclusionVirtual, group-based GDH is an acceptable treatment for patients from rural and urban settings. Given the possible improvements in access and cost-effectiveness that this treatment modality can provide, GI practices may want to consider it in lieu of or in addition to the traditional one-on-one treatment format.

Acceptability and Utility of a Digital Group Intervention to Prevent Perinatal Depression in Youths via Interactive Maternal Group for Information and Emotional Support (IMAGINE): Pilot Cohort Study,"Ronen K, Gewali A, Dachelet K, White E, Jean-Baptiste M, Evans YN, Unger JA, Tandon SD, Bhat A.",JMIR Form Res,2024,"Abstract
Background: Perinatal depression (depression during pregnancy or the first year postpartum) affects 10%-25% of perinatal individuals, with a higher risk among youths aged <25 years. The Mothers and Babies Course (MB) is an evidence-based intervention for the prevention of perinatal depression, grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy, attachment theory, and psychoeducation.

Objective: We developed a digital adaptation of MB (Interactive Maternal Group for Information and Emotional Support [IMAGINE]) and evaluated it in a pre-post mixed methods pilot among young perinatal people in the United States.

Methods: IMAGINE was a structured digital group of up to 7 participants, with scheduled MB content and open discussion for 12 weeks, facilitated by a social worker. Scheduled content included asynchronous SMS text messages, graphics, prerecorded videos, mood polls, and optional weekly synchronous video calls. Eligible participants were pregnant or ≤80 days postpartum, aged 16 to 24 years, had access to a smartphone, spoke English, and had a Patient Health Questionnaire score <10. Participants were recruited throughout the United States from August 2020 to January 2021 through paid social media ads, in-person outreach at clinics, and respondent-driven sampling. Participants completed quantitative questionnaires at enrollment and 3 months, and qualitative interviews at 3 months. We determined uptake, acceptability (by Acceptability of Intervention Measure score), and utility (by use of cognitive behavioral therapy skills). We compared depression symptoms (by Patient Health Questionnaire score), social support (by abbreviated Social Support Behavior score), and perceived stress (by Perceived Stress Score) between enrollment and follow-up by paired 2-tailed t test.

Results: Among 68 individuals who contacted this study, 22 were screened, 13 were eligible, and 10 enrolled, for an uptake of 76.9%. Furthermore, 4 (40%) participants were pregnant at enrollment. Participants had a median age of 17.9 (IQR 17.4-21.7) years, 6 (67%) identified as Black, 5 (56%) Latinx, and 6 (67%) using Medicaid health insurance. Further, 9 (90%) participants completed follow-up. Among these, the mean acceptability score was 4.3 out of 5 (SD 0.6) and all participants said they would recommend IMAGINE to a friend. Participants reported using a median of 7 of 11 skills (IQR 5-7 skills) at least half the days. We found no significant changes in depression symptoms, perceived stress, or social support. Qualitatively, participants reported one-to-one support from the facilitator, connection with other parents, and regular mood reflection were especially helpful aspects of the intervention. Additionally, participants reported that the intervention normalized their mental health challenges, improved their ability to manage their mood, and increased their openness to mental health care.

Conclusions: This pilot study provides promising evidence of the acceptability and utility of IMAGINE among perinatal youths. Our study's small sample size did not detect changes in clinical outcomes; our findings suggest IMAGINE warrants larger-scale evaluation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased focus on telehealth, and while there are excellent resources to guide ethics, standards, and legal decisions (NASW, n.d.), there is less guidance in the literature to specifically inform the adaptation of offline clinical skills to telehealth, particularly for LGBTQ+ youth. To address this gap, we present examples from our experience offering AFFIRM, an affirmative cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group intervention now being delivered through telehealth. Specifically, this paper will: (a) describe the key considerations for the delivery of CBT via telehealth to youth; (b) detail specific clinical skills and strategies to enable successful online implementation; (c) describe the adaptation approach through a case study of cognitive restructuring with a transgender youth; (d) and offer specific guidance to support clinicians to adapt their clinical skills to the virtual environment.",10.1007/s10615-021-00796-x,Social Work,LGBTQ plus youth; Telehealth; Affirmative practice; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Mental health,3,3,1,"Text,Video conference",Not specified,3+,Professional

"Telehealth treatment of patients with major depressive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic: Comparative safety, patient satisfaction, and effectiveness to prepandemic in-person treatment","Zimmerman, M; D'Avanzato, C; King, BT",JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,2023,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic impelled a transition from in-person to telehealth psychiatric treatment. There are no studies of partial hospital telehealth treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we compared the effectiveness of partial hospital care of patients with MDD treated virtually versus in-person.Methods: Outcome was compared in 294 patients who were treated virtually from May 2020 to December 2021 to 542 patients who were treated in the in-person partial program in the 2 years prior to the pandemic. Patients completed self-administered measures of patient satisfaction, symptoms, coping ability, functioning, and general well-being.Results: In both the in-person and telehealth groups, patients with MDD were highly satisfied with treatment and reported a significant reduction in symptoms from admission to discharge. Both groups also reported a significant improvement in positive mental health, general well-being, coping ability, and functioning. A large effect size of treatment was found in both treatment groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, the small differences in outcome favored the telehealth-treated patients. The length of stay and the likelihood of staying in treatment until completion were significantly greater in the virtually treated patients. Limitations: The treatment groups were ascertained sequentially, and telehealth treatment was initiated after the COVID-19 pandemic began. Outcome assessment was limited to a self-administered questionnaire.Conclusions: In an intensive acute care setting, delivering treatment to patients with MDD using a virtual, tele-health platform was as effective as treating patients in-person.",10.1016/j.jad.2022.12.015,Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,Depression; Treatment; Telehealth; Virtual; Partial hospital,3,3,1,Video conference,Not specified,3+,Professional
An Internet-Based Virtual Reality Intervention for Enhancing Self-Esteem in Women With Disabilities: Results of a Feasibility Study,"Nosek, MA; Robinson-Whelen, S; Hughes, RB; Nosek, TM",REHABILITATION PSYCHOLOGY,2016,"Purpose: To examine the feasibility of an online self-esteem enhancement group program for women with disabilities. Method: A sample of 19 racially and ethnically diverse, community-living women with physical disabilities, 22 to 61 years old, participated in a 7-session interactive group intervention (extending Hughes et al., 2004) in the 3-D, immersive, virtual environment of SecondLife.com, using avatars with voice and text communication. Baseline and postintervention questionnaires were administered online. Criteria for determining feasibility were (a) enrollment, (b) engagement, (c) acceptability, and (d) improvement on measures of self-esteem, depression, self-efficacy, and social support. Results: We attained our enrollment goal and engagement exceeded expectations. Acceptability was positive; participants gave helpful and enjoyable ratings of 3.21 and 3.27, respectively, (mean on a 1 to 4 Likert scale, where 4 = high) to 5 intervention components-session materials, group sharing and discussion, relaxation exercises, action planning, and group excursions. Significant increases from baseline to postintervention were found on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (p = .02; Cohen's d = .60) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale = 10 (p = .005; Cohen's d = .74), with a trend toward significance on the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (p = .08; Cohen's d = .42). The intervention did not significantly affect the measure of social support. Implications: An intervention to enhance self-esteem may have a corollary benefit on depressive symptomatology. Offering psycho-educational, small group interventions using online virtual worlds shows promise for circumventing disability-related and environmental barriers to accessing mental health services experienced by women with mobility limitations, and should undergo further development and testing.",10.1037/rep0000107,Psychology; Rehabilitation,women; disability; self-esteem; intervention; virtual reality,3,3,1,Virtual World,Not specified,3+,Professional
Learning from Adolescents and Caregivers to Enhance Acceptability and Engagement Within Virtual Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents Skills Groups: A Qualitative Study,"Conroy, K; Kehrer, SM; Georgiadis, C; Hare, M; Ringle, VM; Shaw, AM",CHILD PSYCHIATRY & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,2024,"Despite the significant increase in adolescent mental health challenges in recent years, structural barriers continue to limit access to and engagement in mental health services. As such, opportunities to learn directly from adolescents and their families on how to best structure and deliver services are paramount. The current study assumes a multi-informant approach and reports on adolescents' and caregivers' (N = 33) experiences in an adapted telehealth/hybrid Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents (DBT-A) program. Focus groups were conducted across two cohorts of families who participated in DBT-A skills groups, to collect family-centered data on the acceptability of program modifications, engagement in the adapted telehealth/hybrid DBT-A, and recommendations for improvement. Participants were predominately Latine White and were from a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, 45.5% of the adolescents identified as LGBTQ + . Focus group findings emphasized how the telehealth platform was both convenient and disengaging, and how in-person sessions offered improved group connection and content engagement. Participants underscored the importance of balancing multi-family group sessions with adolescent- and caregiver-only group sessions in the program, and adolescents emphasized a need for the DBT-A program to better center adolescents' unique experiences and voices throughout sessions. Both adolescents and caregivers suggested modifications to synthesize the content and improve generalizability of the DBT-A skills to their real lives. Overall, these findings add to a new and evolving branch of DBT-A qualitative inquiry, as well as the growing body of work that recommends incorporating the voices of people with lived experiences into the development and modification of psychological services.",10.1007/s10578-023-01641-7,Psychology; Pediatrics; Psychiatry,Dialectical behavior therapy for adolescents; Qualitative methods; Treatment acceptability; Telehealth and hybrid group therapy; Patient-centered program feedback,3,4,0.75,Video conference,Not specified,3+,Professional
Evaluating the Efficacy of Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Blended With Synchronous Chat Sessions to Treat Adolescent Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Topooco, N; Byléhn, S; Nysäter, ED; Holmlund, J; Lindegaard, J; Johansson, S; Åberg, L; Nordgren, LB; Zetterqvist, M; Andersson, G",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: Depression is a common and serious problem among adolescents, but few seek or have access to therapy. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapies (ICBTs), developed to increase treatment access, show promise in reducing depression. The inclusion of coach support in treatment is desired and may be needed. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of an ICBT protocol blended with weekly real-time therapist sessions via chat; blended treatment, for adolescent depression, including major depressive episode (MDE). The protocol has previously been evaluated in a controlled study. Methods: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, adolescents 15 to 19 years of age were recruited through a community setting at the national level in Sweden (n=70) and allocated to either 8 weeks of treatment or to minimal attention control. Depression was assessed at baseline, at posttreatment, and at 12 months following treatment (in the intervention group). The primary outcome was self-reported depression level as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory II at posttreatment. The intervention was offered without the need for parental consent. Results: Over two weeks, 162 adolescents registered and completed the baseline screening. Eligible participants (n=70) were on average 17.5 years of age (SD 1.15), female (96%, 67/70), suffered from MDE (76%, 53/70), had no previous treatment experience (64%, 45/70), and reported guardian(s) to be aware about their depression state (71%, 50/70). The average intervention completion was 74% (11.8 of 16 modules and sessions). Following the treatment, ICBT participants demonstrated a significant decrease in depression symptoms compared with controls (P<.001), corresponding to a large between-group effect (intention-to-treat analysis: d=0.86, 95% CI 0.37-1.35; of completer analysis: d=0.99, 95% CI 0.48-1.51). A significant between-group effect was observed in the secondary depression outcome (P=.003); clinically significant improvement was found in 46% (16/35) of ICBT participants compared with 11% (4/35) in the control group (P=.001). Conclusions: The results are in line with our previous study, further demonstrating that adolescents with depression can successfully be engaged in and experience significant improvement following ICBT blended with therapist chat sessions.

Coping Strategies and Social Support in a Mobile Phone Chat App Designed to Support Smoking Cessation: Qualitative Analysis,"Granado-Font, E; Ferré-Grau, C; Rey-Reñones, C; Pons-Vigués, M; Ribera, EP; Berenguera, A; Barrera-Uriarte, ML; Basora, J; Valverde-Trillo, A; Duch, J; Flores-Mateo, G",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2018,"Background: Smoking is one of the most significant factors contributing to low life expectancy, health inequalities, and illness at the worldwide scale. Smoking cessation attempts benefit from social support. Mobile phones have changed the way we communicate through the use of freely available message-oriented apps. Mobile app-based interventions for smoking cessation programs can provide interactive, supportive, and individually tailored interventions. Objective: This study aimed to identify emotions, coping strategies, beliefs, values, and cognitive evaluations of smokers who are in the process of quitting, and to analyze online social support provided through the analysis of messages posted to a chat function integrated into a mobile app. Methods: In this descriptive qualitative study, informants were smokers who participated in the chat of Tobbstop. The technique to generate information was documentary through messages collected from September 2014 through June 2016, specifically designed to support a smoking cessation intervention. A thematic content analysis of the messages applied 2 conceptual models: the Lazarus and Folkman model to assess participant's experiences and perceptions and the Cutrona model to evaluate online social support. Results: During the study period, 11,788 text messages were posted to the chat by 101 users. The most frequent messages offered information and emotional support, and all the basic emotions were reported in the chat. The 3 most frequent coping strategies identified were physical activity, different types of treatment such as nicotine replacement, and humor. Beliefs about quitting smoking included the inevitability of weight gain and the notion that not using any type of medications is better for smoking cessation. Health and family were the values more frequently described, followed by freedom. A smoke-free environment was perceived as important to successful smoking cessation. The social support group that was developed with the app offered mainly emotional and informational support. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that a chat integrated into a mobile app focused on supporting smoking cessation provides a useful tool for smokers who are in the process of quitting, by offering social support and a space to share concerns, information, or strategies.",10.2196/11071,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,primary health care; qualitative research; mobile apps; smoking cessation; social support; psychological adaptation,3,3,1,Text,Mobile,3+,"Peer ,Professional"
The Role of Communication Affordances in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Facebook and WhatsApp Support Groups,"Yeshua-Katz, D",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,2021,"(1) Background: Digital health research has indicated that people with stigmatized health problems are drawn to online support groups (OSGs) because these groups help them to manage such conditions. However, little is known about how media affordances-interactions between the technology and the user-reconfigure the ways in which stigmatized individuals use OSGs and interact with others like themselves. (2) Method: The current study applied an affordance framework to evaluate how Facebook and WhatsApp support groups can help military veterans and their partners cope with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was based on interviews with 34 PTSD-OSG members in Israel. (3) Findings: This research identified five affordances that members appraised as enhancing their coping efforts in the digital world: visibility, availability, multimediality, surveillance, and synchronicity. (4) Conclusions: This study reveals the connection between a specific stigmatized mental health disorder (i.e., PTSD) and perceptions of communication technologies (i.e., affordances), and specifies the uses of technologies for coping with this mental health disorder. Moreover, this study may inform digital intervention designers about which communication affordances can potentially lead to better health outcomes.",10.3390/ijerph18094576,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",stigma; social media; affordances; social support; post-traumatic stress disorder,3,4,0.75,Text,"Mobile,Monitor",3+,"Peer "

These barriers may be overcome by using mobile health services (mHealth). To examine the effectiveness of mHealth professional consultation services in preventing postpartum depressive symptoms in real-world settings, we conducted this randomized controlled trial in Japan, where universal free face-to-face perinatal care is available.MethodsThis study included 734 pregnant women living in Yokohama city who could communicate in Japanese, recruited at public offices and childcare support facilities. The participants were randomized to the mHealth group (intervention, n = 365), where they could use a free app-based mHealth consultation service with gynecologists/obstetricians, pediatricians, and midwives whenever and as many times as they wanted between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on weekdays throughout their pregnancy and postpartum periods (funded by the City of Yokohama government) or the usual care group (control, n = 369).

Mood Lifters for Graduate Students and Young Adults: A Mixed-Methods Investigation into Mechanisms of Change in Online Group Therapy,"Pokowitz EL, Prakash N, Planaj D, Oprandi S, Deldin PJ.",Behav Sci (Basel),2024,"Mood Lifters (ML) is a dimensional, group-based, peer-led mental health program that has shown efficacy in mitigating psychopathology and promoting wellness within a variety of populations. There is not yet evidence for mechanism(s) driving these changes. Qualitative data exploring the lived experiences of participants may be a unique way to develop hypotheses about the potential mechanisms driving change. The current study used qualitative and quantitative data from the ML for Graduate Students (ML-GS) and Young Adults (ML-YA) studies to generate hypotheses regarding potential mechanisms of changes experienced in ML. Seventy-nine graduate students and fifty-nine non-student young adults provided quantitative and qualitative feedback after participating in a 12-week virtual ML program. Inductive qualitative analysis was conducted within a reflexive thematic framework. Descriptive statistics of quantitative measures were also calculated. Three themes suggest potential directions for future mechanism research on virtual ML programs. Most participants emphasized the social connections built in groups as the most potent and powerful aspects of ML, while others focused on the design or content of the program. Quantitative data presented contextualize the lived experiences of participants. Future ML research should explore the three themes identified within this study through continued qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis.

Targeted postnatal education and support through a mobile health intervention may improve postnatal recovery, neonatal care practices, nutritional status, knowledge and care seeking, and mental health. Objective: We sought to understand the feasibility and acceptability of our first pilot phase, a flexible 6-week postnatal mobile health intervention delivered to 3 groups of women in Punjab, India, and adapt our intervention for our next pilot phase, which will formally assess intervention feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Methods: Our intervention prototype was designed to deliver culturally tailored educational programming via a provider-moderated, voice- and text-based group approach to connect new mothers with a social support group of other new mothers, increase their health-related communication with providers, and refer them to care needed. We targeted deployment using feature phones to include participants from diverse socioeconomic groups. We held moderated group calls weekly, disseminated educational audios, and created SMS text messaging groups. We varied content delivery, group discussion participation, and chat moderation. Three groups of postpartum women from Punjab were recruited for the pilot through community health workers. Sociodemographic data were collected at baseline. Intervention feasibility and acceptability were assessed through weekly participant check-ins (N=29), weekly moderator reports, structured end-line in-depth interviews among a subgroup of participants (15/29, 52%), and back-end technology data. Results: The participants were aged 24 to 28 years and 1 to 3 months postpartum. Of the 29 participants, 17 (59%) had their own phones. Half of the participants (14/29, 48%) attended >= 3 of the 6 calls; the main barriers were childcare and household responsibilities and network or phone issues. Most participants were very satisfied with the intervention (16/19, 84%) and found the educational content (20/20, 100%) and group discussions (17/20, 85%) very useful. The participants used the SMS text messaging chat, particularly when facilitator-moderated. Sustaining participation and fostering group interactions was limited by technological and sociocultural challenges. Conclusions: The intervention was considered generally feasible and acceptable, and protocol adjustments were identified to improve intervention delivery and engagement. To address technological issues, we engaged a cloud-based service provider for group calls and an interactive voice response service provider for educational recordings and developed a smartphone app for the participants. We seek to overcome sociocultural challenges through new strategies for increasing group engagement, including targeting midlevel female community health care providers as moderators.

A Digital Intervention Addressing Alcohol Use Problems (the Daybreak Program): Quasi-Experimental Randomized Controlled Trial,"Tait, RJ; Castro, RP; Kirkman, JJL; Moore, JC; Schaub, MP",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: Alcohol use is prevalent in many societies and has major adverse impacts on health, but the availability of effective interventions limits treatment options for those who want assistance in changing their patterns of alcohol use. Objective: This study evaluated the new Daybreak program, which is accessible via mobile app and desktop and was developed by Hello Sunday Morning to support high-risk drinking individuals looking to change their relationship with alcohol. In particular, we compared the effect of adding online coaching via real-time chat messages (intervention group) to an otherwise self-guided program (control group). Methods: We designed the intervention as a randomized control trial, but as some people (n=48; 11.9%) in the control group were able to use the online coaching, the main analysis comprised all participants. We collected online surveys at one-month and three-months follow-up. The primary outcome was change in alcohol risk (measured with the alcohol use disorders identification test-consumption [AUDIT-C] score), but other outcomes included the number of standard drinks per week, alcohol-related days out of role, psychological distress (Kessler-10), and quality of life (EUROHIS-QOL). Markers of engagement with the program included posts to the site and comments on the posts of others. The primary analysis used Weighted Generalized Estimating Equations. Results: We recruited 398 people to the intervention group (50.2%) and 395 people to the control group (49.8%). Most were female (71%) and the mean age was 40.1 years. Most participants were classified as probably dependent (550, 69%) on the AUDIT-10, with 243 (31%) classified with hazardous or harmful consumption. We followed up with 334 (42.1%) participants at one month and 293 (36.9%) at three months. By three months there were significant improvements in AUDIT-C scores (down from mean 9.1 [SD 1.9] to 5.8 [SD 3.1]), alcohol consumed per week (down from mean 37.1 [SD 28.3] to mean 17.5 [SD 18.9]), days out of role (down from mean 1.6 [SD 3.6] to 0.5 [SD 1.6]), quality of life (up from 3.2 [SD 0.7] to 3.6 [SD 0.7]) and reduced distress (down from 24.8 [SD 7.0] to 19.0 [SD 6.6]). Accessing online coaching was not associated with improved outcomes, but engagement with the program (eg, posts and comments on the posts of others) were significantly associated with improvements (eg, in AUDIT-C, alcohol use and EUROHIS-QOL). Reduced alcohol use was found for both probably dependent (estimated marginal mean of 40.8 to 20.1 drinks) and hazardous or harmful alcohol users (estimated marginal mean of 22.9 to 11.9 drinks). Conclusions: Clinically significant reductions in alcohol use were found, as well as reduced alcohol risk (AUDIT-C) and days out of role. Importantly, improved alcohol-related outcomes were found for both hazardous or harmful and probably dependent drinkers. Since October 2016, Daybreak has reached more than 50,000 participants. Therefore, there is the potential for the program to have an impact on alcohol-related problems at a population health level, importantly including an effect on probably dependent drinkers.",10.2196/14967,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,alcohol consumption; internet; intervention study; social marketing; health promotion,3,4,0.75,Text,"Mobile,Monitor",3+,"Professional,Peer "
A Customized Social Network Platform (Kids Helpline Circles) for Delivering Group Counseling to Young People Experiencing Family Discord That Impacts Their Well-Being: Exploratory Study,"Campbell, A; Ridout, B; Amon, K; Navarro, P; Collyer, B; Dalgleish, J",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: It has often been reported that young people are at high risk of mental health concerns, more so than at any other time in development over their life span. The situational factors that young people report as impacting their well-being are not addressed as often: specifically, family discord. Kids Helpline, a national service in Australia that provides free counseling online and by telephone to young people in distress, report that family discord and well-being issues are one of the major concerns reported by clients. In order to meet the preferences that young people seek when accessing counseling support, Kids Helpline has designed and trialed a custom-built social network platform for group counseling of young people experiencing family discord that impacts their well-being. Objective: In this exploratory study, we communicate the findings of Phase 1 of an innovative study in user and online counselor experience. This will lead to an iterative design for a world-first, purpose-built social network that will do the following: (1) increase reach and quality of service by utilizing a digital tool of preference for youth to receive peer-to-peer and counselor-to-peer support in a safe online environment and (2) provide the evidence base to document the best practice for online group counseling in a social network environment. Methods: The study utilized a participatory action research design. Young people aged 13-25 years (N=105) with mild-to-moderate depression or anxiety (not high risk) who contacted Kids Helpline were asked if they would like to trial the social networking site (SNS) for peer-to-peer and counselor-to-peer group support. Subjects were grouped into age cohorts of no more than one year above or below their reported age and assigned to groups of no more than 36 participants, in order to create a community of familiarity around age and problems experienced. Each group entered into an 8-week group counseling support program guided by counselors making regular posts and providing topic-specific content for psychoeducation and discussion. Counselors provided a weekly log of events to researchers; at 2-week intervals, subjects provided qualitative and quantitative feedback through open-ended questions and specific psychometric measures. Results: Qualitative results provided evidence of user support and benefits of the online group counseling environment. Counselors also reported benefits of the modality of therapy delivery. Psychometric scales did not report significance in changes of mood or affect. Counselors and users suggested improvements to the platform to increase user engagement. Conclusions: Phase 1 provided proof of concept for this mode of online counseling delivery. Users and counselors saw value in the model and innovation of the service. Phase 2 will address platform issues with changes to a new social network platform.",10.2196/16176,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,social media; social networking; online counseling; family discord; well-being,3,3,1,Text,Mobile,3+,Professional
The Effectiveness of an App-Based Nurse-Moderated Program for New Mothers With Depression and Parenting Problems (eMums Plus): Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial,"Sawyer, A; Kaim, A; Le, HN; McDonald, D; Mittinty, M; Lynch, J; Sawyer, M",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: Postnatal depression and caregiving difficulties adversely affect mothers, infants, and later childhood development. In many countries, resources to help mothers and infants are limited. Online group-based nurse-led interventions have the potential to help address this problem by providing large numbers of mothers with access to professional and peer support during the postnatal period. Objective: This study tested the effectiveness of a 4-month online group-based nurse-led intervention delivered when infants were aged 2 to 6 months as compared with standard care outcomes. Methods: The study was a block randomized control trial. Mothers were recruited at the time they were contacted for the postnatal health check offered to all mothers in South Australia. Those who agreed to participate were randomly assigned to the intervention or standard care. The overall response rate was 63.3% (133/210). Primary outcomes were the level of maternal depressive symptoms assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and quality of maternal caregiving assessed using the Parenting Stress Index (PSI; competence and attachment subscales), the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSCS), and the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Scale. Assessments were completed at baseline (mean child age 4.9 weeks [SD 1.4]) and again when infants were aged 8 and 12 months. Results: Outcomes were evaluated using linear generalized estimating equations adjusting for postrandomization group differences in demographic characteristics and the outcome score at baseline. There were no significant differences in the intervention and standard care groups in scores on the PSI competence subscale (P=.69) nor in the PSCS (P=.11). Although the group by time interaction suggested there were differences over time between the EPDS and PSI attachment subscale scores in the intervention and standard care groups (P=.001 and P=.04, respectively), these arose largely because the intervention group had stable scores over time whereas the standard care group showed some improvements between baseline and 12 months. Mothers engaged well with the intervention with at least 60% (43/72) of mothers logging-in once per week during the first 11 weeks of the intervention. The majority of mothers also rated the intervention as helpful and user-friendly. Conclusions: Mothers reported that the intervention was helpful, and the app was described as easy to use. As such, it appears that support for mothers during the postnatal period, provided using mobile phone technology, has the potential to be an important addition to existing services. Possible explanations for the lack of differences in outcomes for the 2 groups in this study are the failure of many mothers to use key components of the intervention and residual differences between the intervention and standard care groups post randomization.",10.2196/13689,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,mobile phone; infant; mother-child relations; postnatal depression; randomized controlled trial,3,3,1,Text,Mobile,3+,Professional
"Effects of a smartphone-based videoconferencing program for older nursing home residents on depression, loneliness, and quality of life: a quasi-experimental study","Tsai, HH; Cheng, CY; Shieh, WY; Chang, YC",BMC GERIATRICS,2020,"Background Smartphones can optimize the opportunities for interactions between nursing home residents and their families. However, the effectiveness of smartphone-based videoconferencing programs in enhancing emotional status and quality of life has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate of the effect of a smartphone-based videoconferencing program on nursing home residents' feelings of loneliness, depressive symptoms and quality of life. Methods This study used a quasi-experimental research design. Older residents from seven nursing homes in Taiwan participated in this study. Nursing homes (NH) were randomly selected as sites for either the intervention group (5 NH) or the control group (2 NH); NH residents who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate. The intervention group was comprised of 32 participants; the control group was comprised of 30 participants. The intervention group interacted with their family members once a week for 6 months using a smartphone and a LINE application (app). Data were collected with self-report instruments: subjective feelings of loneliness, using the University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale; depressive symptoms, using the Geriatric Depression Scale; and quality of life using the SF-36. Data were collected at four time points (baseline, and at 1-month, 3-months and 6-months from baseline). Data were analysed using the generalized estimating equation approach. Results After the intervention, as compared to those in the control group, participants in interventional group had significant decreases in baseline loneliness scores at 1 months (beta = - 3.41, p < 0.001), 3 months (beta = - 5.96, p < 0.001), and 6 months (beta = - 7.50, p < 0.001), and improvements in physical role (beta = 36.49, p = 0.01), vitality (beta = 13.11, p < 0.001) and pain scores (beta = 16.71, p = 0.01) at 6 months. However, changes in mean depression scores did not significantly differ between groups.

"Remote group therapies for cognitive health in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders: Feasible, acceptable, engaging","Mendelson, D; Thibaudeau, E; Sauvé, G; Lavigne, KM; Bowie, CR; Menon, M; Woodward, TS; Lepage, M; Raucher-Chene, D",SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH-COGNITION,2022,"Severe cognitive impairments and cognitive distortions are core to schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSDs) and are associated with deteriorated social functioning. Despite well-established efficacy of group psychosocial therapies targeting cognitive health in SSDs, dissemination of these programs remains limited. Remote delivery offers a promising strategy for increasing the programs' accessibility. Yet, little research has evaluated group therapies for cognitive health delivered in this way. Thus, we aimed to assess, from participants' and therapists' perspectives, the feasibility, acceptability, as well as levels and process of engagement in a videoconference delivery of group psychosocial therapies for SSD patients' cognitive health. Participants, outpatients, attended Action Based Cognitive Remediation or Metacognitive Training, both adapted for videoconference. Then, participants and therapists completed post-therapy questionnaires. Of the 28 participants attending at least one session, 75% completed more than half of sessions and seven dropped out. Technology did not appear to significantly hinder participation in the programs. All completing participants reported a positive experience with therapy, 67% were not bothered by the distance from the therapist, and 77% trusted that the information shared was kept confidential. Therapist-rated levels of attention M = 7.5/9 (SD = 1.04), participation M = 6.91/9 (SD = 1.32), and social interactions M = 5.31/9 (SD = 1.96) were satisfactory. Nonetheless, participants indicated that they would have appreciated more social interactions with group members. These positive results validate the earliest stage in the implementation process for remote group therapies targeting cognitive health in SSDs.

"Recruitment, adherence and attrition challenges in internet-based indicated prevention programs for eating disorders: lessons learned from a randomised controlled trial of ProYouth OZ","Ali, K; Fassnacht, DB; Farrer, LM; Rieger, E; Moessner, M; Bauer, S; Griffiths, KM",JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS,2022,"Background: Growing evidence supports the effectiveness of Internet-based prevention programs for eating disorders, but the adjunctive benefit of synchronous peer support has yet to be investigated. In the current study, a randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of an indicated Internet-based prevention program (ProYouth OZ) with and without peer-to-peer support in reducing disordered eating behaviours and attitudes. Method: Fifty young adults (18-25 years) with eating disorder symptoms were randomised to one of three study conditions: (1) ProYouth OZ (without peer-to-peer support), (2) ProYouth OZ Peers (with peer-to-peer support), and (3) a waitlist control group. Outcomes were assessed at three different time points. Eating disorder symptoms (primary outcome) were measured with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire. Results: Of 415 screened participants, 73 (17.6%) were eligible and 213 (51.3%) excluded due to severe eating disorder symptoms. Fifteen participants (30%) completed the post-intervention survey. Of the two intervention groups, 20.6% failed to access any component of the program. Of 17 ProYouth OZ Peers participants, 58.8% attended at least one chat session, 20% attended 2-5 sessions, and 11.8% attended all six sessions. Due to limited outcome data, it was not possible to statistically examine between-group differences in outcomes. Visual inspection of individual profiles revealed that both ProYouth OZ Peers participants who completed the post-intervention survey showed a decrease in disordered eating compared with only one of the six completers in ProYouth OZ. Conclusion: Findings highlight the challenges of trialling Internet-based eating disorder prevention programs in the community. The study identified a large group of emerging adults with eating disorders who were interested in an Internet-based program, suggesting a high level of unmet need. Future research on synchronous peer-to-peer support in Internet-based prevention for eating disorders is warranted. Further studies are required to identify optimal strategies for reaching this population (e.g., online vs. offline) and evaluating the effectiveness of a range of strategies for promoting engagement. Finally, there is an urgent need to develop innovative widely accessible interventions for individuals who experience clinically relevant eating disorder symptomatology but may not be ready or able to seek professional face-to-face treatment.",10.1186/s40337-021-00520-7,Psychology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Psychiatry,Online intervention; Peer support; Mental health; Barriers; Stigma; Eating disorder literacy; Help-seeking; Body image; Digital health,3,3,1,Text,Monitor,3+,"Peer "
Evaluation of a Technology-Based Peer-Support Intervention Program for Preventing Postnatal Depression (Part 2): Qualitative Study,"Shorey, S; Ng, ED",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: Social support is known to reduce risks of postnatal depression (PND) and improve maternal emotional well-being. However, the Asian cultural context is often neglected when appraising maternal needs and mothers' preferences for social support. While many preventive efforts have experimented with technology, professionals, and paraprofessionals in providing social support to mothers in need, most studies determined the effectiveness of their interventions through quantitative measurements of maternal outcomes. Experiences and feedback from both participants and administrators are rarely discussed, especially in an Asian setting. Objective: The goal of the research was to evaluate the postnatal experiences of Asian mothers at risk of PND and the perceptions of peer volunteers regarding a technology-based peer-support intervention program (PIP). Methods: A qualitative semistructured interview was conducted with 20 Asian mothers at risk of depression (10 from the control group and 10 from the intervention group) and 19 peer volunteers from a randomized controlled trial. The PIP included weekly correspondence between peer volunteers and mothers through any telecommunication means over 4 weeks. All interviews were approximately 30 to 60 minutes long, audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Study findings were reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials checklist. Results: Two overarching themes comprising five subthemes were generated: postnatal experience (a bouncy ride, a way forward) and evaluation of the PIP (valuable, flexible, and supportive program; building blocks of a good relationship; and lessons learned and the road ahead). Mothers from both the control and interventions groups were generally satisfied with hospital care and the support received from family. They also shared similar breastfeeding challenges and needs for more informed decisions and follow-up support from the hospital. However, mothers who received the PIP tended to have more positive outlooks of their birth experiences. Overall, peer volunteers and mothers involved in the PIP found the PIP useful and expressed satisfaction with the program's flexibility. They also shared their personal takeaways, the qualities of their friendships, and the need for extended correspondence time and recommended outreach to non-at-risk mothers. Conclusions: The positive endorsement of the PIP by peer volunteers and mothers suggests the success of the PIP in maintaining positive maternal emotional well-being during the postpartum period. With the help of technology, hospitals can easily provide additional peer support to at-risk mothers in addition to existing standard care offered to these mothers.",10.2196/12915,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,depression; mothers; postpartum; qualitative; social support; telecommunication; digital health; peer support; peer-to-peer support; online support groups; internet,3,4,0.75,"Text,Voice conferences",Mobile,2,"Peer "

However, barriers often prevent older individuals from attending support groups. This controlled pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability of an online, real-time, interactive virtual reality (VR) support group for widow(er)s, and assessed the preliminary efficacy of the VR support group for improving psychosocial outcomes and sleep quality compared to an active control grief education website. Thirty widow(er)s (M-age = 67.0, SD = 11.0) participated in an 8-week VR support group or accessed a grief education website. Participants completed self-report measures of depression, grief intensity, grief cognitions, yearning, loneliness, perceived stress and sleep quality at three time points. Participant attrition and self-report indicated that both interventions were feasible and acceptable. Both groups showed significant improvements in grief severity, grief cognitions, yearning, loneliness, perceived stress, and global sleep quality across study time points. However, only widow(er)s in the VR support group showed a significant improvement in depression across time.

Combining online and offline peer support groups in community mental health care settings: a qualitative study of service users' experiences,"Strand, M; Eng, LS; Gammon, D",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS,2020,"Background Peer support for people with long-term mental health problems is central to recovery-oriented approaches in mental health care. Peer support has traditionally been conducted offline in face-to-face groups, while online groups on the Internet have increased rapidly. Offline and online peer support groups are shown to have differing strengths and weaknesses. However, little is known about how combining the two formats might be experienced by service users, which this paper aims to illuminate. Methods In this exploratory and descriptive study, a recovery-oriented Internet-based portal called ReConnect was used by service users in two mental health communities in Norway for 6-12 months. The portal included an online peer support group which also facilitated participation in local offline peer support groups. Both group formats were moderated by an employed service user consultant. Qualitative data about service users' experiences were collected through focus groups and individual interviews and inductively analyzed thematically. Results A total of 14 female service users 22-67 years of age with various diagnoses participated in three focus groups and 10 individual interviews. Two main themes were identified: (1) balancing anonymity and openness, and (2) enabling connectedness. These themes are further illustrated with the subthemes: (i) dilemmas of anonymity and confidentiality, (ii) towards self-disclosure and openness, (iii) new friendships, and (iv) networks in the local community. Three of the subthemes mainly describe benefits, while challenges were more implicit and cut across the subthemes. Identified challenges were related to transitions from anonymity online to revealing one's identity offline, confidentiality, and barriers related to participation in offline peer support groups. Conclusions This study suggests that online and offline peer support groups complement each other, and that combining them is mainly described as beneficial by service users. Identified benefits appeared to arise from service users' options of one format or the other, or that they could combine formats in ways that suited their individual values and comfort zones. Moderation by a trained service user consultant appeared essential for both formats and can be used systematically to address identified challenges. Combining online and offline peer support groups is a promising concept for facilitating recovery-oriented care and warrants continued research.",10.1186/s13033-020-00370-x,Psychiatry,eHealth; Mental health; Recovery; e-Recovery; Peer support; Social support; Qualitative research; Participatory research,3,3,1,Text,Monitor,3+,"Peer "

As such, specialized and affirming treatment is needed for SGM individuals with disordered eating, and research is needed to better understand what this treatment should include. The current study investigates a rolling, open, counselor-facilitated, free, virtual support group for SGM individuals with disordered eating to better understand support and healing processes, which in turn could be applied or expanded upon in other treatment settings. Participants were 27 SGM adults. All participants completed online surveys, and some (15/27) also completed semistructured focus groups about their experiences in the support group to reflect on shared meaning created within the group and ways that the counselor-facilitated support group fostered learning and healing related to disordered eating, mental health recovery, gender, and sexual identity. Inductive reflexive thematic analysis yielded the following themes: (a) community building and safety, (b) a crucially important space, (c) intersectional healing and insight, (d) seeing futures and building hope, and (e) ripple effects.

Objectives: This research was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) in reducing body mass index (BMI), stress, anxiety, and depression in overweight women via a virtual group. Methods: This randomized controlled trial study was conducted on three groups of the experiment, the waiting list, and the treatment-as-usual. It was done as single-phase, single-center, and double-blinded. The statistical population included all women with BMI >= 25 in Neyshabur city in 2019 - 2020.

"Intraindividual, Dyadic, and Network Communication in a Digital Health Intervention: Distinguishing Message Exposure from Message Production","Mi, RRZ; Kornfield, R; Shah, DV; Maus, A; Gustafson, DH",HEALTH COMMUNICATION,2022,"Communicating within digital health interventions involves a range of behaviors that may contribute to the management of chronic illnesses in different ways. This study examines whether communication within a smartphone-based application for addiction recovery produces distinct effects depending on 1) the level of communication, defined as intraindividual communication (e.g., journal entries to oneself); dyadic communication (e.g., private messaging to other individuals); or network communication (e.g., discussion forum posts to all group members), and 2) whether individuals produce or are exposed to messages. We operationalize these communication levels and behaviors based on system use logs as the number of clicks dedicated to each activity and assess how each category of system use relates to changes in group bonding and substance use after 6 months with the mobile intervention. Our findings show that (1) intraindividual exposure to one's own past posts marginally predicts decreased drug use; (2) dyadic production predicts greater perceived bonding; while dyadic exposure marginally predicts reduced drug use; (3) network production predicts decreased risky drinking.

"Randomized controlled pilot study of feasibility and effectiveness of peer led remote Mindfulness-Based Art Workshops on stress, anxiety, and depression in medical students","Wang, CY; Darbari, I; Tolaymat, M; Quezada, S; Allen, J; Cross, RK",PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS,2023,"Medical students report high levels of psychological distress compared to the general population, yet they also underutilize mental health services. Our Mindfulness-Based Art Workshops (MBAW) combine two established, formal interventions: (a) Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, an 8-week group series teaching mindfulness practices, shown to reduce self-reported measures of stress, and (b) art therapy, the use of art exercises guided by certified therapists, shown to reduce stress and anxiety in hospitalized patients and students. The goal of our study was to determine if a peer-led, virtual workshop series designed specifically for and by medical students may be a feasible and effective method of adapting these models to improve student well-being. We hypothesized that virtual, medical student led MBAW are effective in reducing measures of stress, anxiety, and depression in medical students and improving well-being scores. In 2020, 24 University of Maryland School of Medicine first- and second-year medical students were randomized to either the MBAW or no-intervention control group. Primary outcomes included (a) short-term change in State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores and (b) difference in the perceived stress scores between intervention and control group immediately after, and 2, 4, and 6 weeks after a 6-session intervention. At specific time points, participants completed questionnaires, which included STAI and National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Perceived Stress survey. We compared the percentage of intervention participants who had clinically significant anxiety before and after MBAW for each session using a generalized estimating equations methodology and compared change from baseline scores between intervention and control groups using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures analysis. In the intervention group, post-MBAW STAI scores decreased by 16.2 (p = .0001), 5 (p = .1544), 13.7 (p = .0002), 13.6 (p = .0006), 12.1 (p = .0009), and 11.9 (p = .0011) points after sessions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Intervention group perceived stress scores decreased from baseline by 5.9 (p = .07) and 4.7 (p = .09) points more than the control group immediately after, and 2 weeks after the 6-session intervention. MBAW sessions are effective at significantly reducing short-term anxiety, and a 6-session MBAW workshop intervention shows trends toward decreasing levels of perceived stress lasting 2 weeks following the intervention, although these findings were not statistically significant. Future studies should evaluate a larger population to confirm the positive findings of this pilot study, which we hope will encourage medical schools to consider integrating and supporting such programs as a method of addressing the urgent need to aid student well-being, within logistical, time, and cost constraints of students and administrators.",10.1002/pits.22809,Psychology,art; medical-school; medical-student; mindfulness; stress; virtual,3,4,0.75,Video conference,Monitor,3+,"Peer "
Smoking Cessation Intervention Trial Outcomes for Sexual and Gender Minority Young Adults,"Vogel, EA; Thrul, J; Humfleet, GL; Delucchi, KL; Ramo, DE",HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY,2019,"Objective: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals are more likely to smoke than are non-SGM individuals. It is unclear whether smoking cessation interventions for young adults are effective in the SGM population. The purpose of this study was to compare smoking cessation, other health risk behaviors, and intervention usability between SGM and non-SGM young adult smokers participating in a digital smoking cessation intervention trial. Methods: Young adult smokers (N = 500; 135 SGM) were assigned to a 90-day Facebook smoking cessation intervention (treatment) or referred to Smokefree. gov (control). Intervention participants were assigned to private Facebook groups tailored to their readiness to quit smoking. Participants reported their smoking status and other health risk behaviors at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Usability of the intervention (i.e., perceptions of the intervention and treatment engagement) was assessed in the intervention group at 3 months. Results: Smoking cessation and intervention usability did not significantly differ between SGM participants and non-SGM participants. A greater proportion of SGM participants were at high risk for physical inactivity over the 12-month follow-up period (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55, p = .005). Conclusion: SGM and non-SGM young adult smokers did not differ in their smoking cessation rates, perceptions of, or engagement in a digital intervention. Health risk behavior patterns were mostly similar; however, the disparity in physical activity between SGM and non-SGM smokers widened over time. Tailored interventions for SGM young adult smokers could increase focus on SGM experiences that can underlie multiple health risk behaviors, such as discrimination and the normativity of smoking.",10.1037/hea0000698,Psychology,smoking cessation; young adults; Facebook; social media; sexual minorities,3,3,1,Text,Not specified,3+,"Peer ,Professional"

Internet-based interventions (IBIs) based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are effective in reducing symptom severity but data on their impact on quality of life in clinically depressed patients so far is scarce. Methods Selfapy is a CBT-based IBI for depressive disorders. 401 participants (332 female, mean age 37 (SD = 11) with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymia were enrolled in a randomized, parallel, three-arm trial comparing a therapist-guided Selfapy intervention with an unguided Selfapy intervention and a waiting list control. QOL was measured using the WHOQOL-BREF at baseline, post-treatment (12 weeks) and at 24-week follow-up. The effects of the interventions on QOL were calculated using linear mixed effects models. Results At post-treatment (12 weeks) the guided and unguided intervention groups reported an increase in QOL on physical and psychological health domains compared to controls (significant group*time interaction). The gain in QOL was maintained over the follow-up period only for psychological health. QOL decreased in the social relationships and environment domains over the course of treatment and during the follow-up treatment for all participants. There were no differences between the guided and the unguided intervention. Conclusion Selfapy proved to positively affect psychological and physical QOL in a sample of participants suffering from depressive disorders and can therefore be considered an effective and highly scalable therapeutic tool. The pattern of results might partly be attributable to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures that coincided with the trial.Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS): DRKS00017191.

FEASIBILITY STUDY OF A PSYCHODYNAMIC ONLINE GROUP INTERVENTION FOR DEPRESSION,"Lemma, A; Fonagy, P",PSYCHOANALYTIC PSYCHOLOGY,2013,"Dynamic Interpersonal Therapy (DIT) was originally developed as a brief psychodynamic intervention for the treatment of depression and anxiety. More recently it has become the psychodynamic protocol for depression specifically within Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services across the U.K. The aim of the present study was to pilot and evaluate the feasibility of a group online version of DIT-Online Group Dynamic Interpersonal Therapy-and the perceived helpfulness of psychodynamically informed self-help materials. Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to three groups. Participants in Condition A (n = 8) took part in an online DIT group, with self-help materials, facilitated by a therapist. Participants in Condition B (n = 8) were given access to a closed virtual group space where they could interact with each other and were supplied with the same self-help materials used by participants in Condition A, but without online therapist facilitation. Participants in Condition C (n = 8) received no instructions or facilitation, but had access to an online mental well-being site where they could meet virtually in a large, open, moderated virtual group space to discuss their psychological difficulties. This feasibility study was underpowered to detect significant differences in rates of change between facilitated and unfacilitated provision of material, but decline in symptoms appeared to be superior to control only for the facilitated group when the groups were considered separately. The response of the combined treated groups against control suggests that the DIT self-help materials may be helpful and appear to support the process of change. Further work is required.",10.1037/a0033239,Psychology,anxiety; depression; dynamic interpersonal therapy (DIT); online therapy; psychodynamic therapy,3,3,1,Text,Not specified,3+,Professional
"Experiencing EVA Park, a Multi-User Virtual World for People with Aphasia","Galliers, J; Wilson, S; Marshall, J; Talbot, R; Devane, N; Booth, T; Woolf, C; Greenwood, H",ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ACCESSIBLE COMPUTING,2017,"Virtual worlds are used in wide-ranging ways by many people with long-term health conditions, but their use by people with aphasia (PWA) has been limited. In contrast, this article reports the use of EVA Park, a multi-user virtual world designed for PWA to practice conversations, focusing on people's emotional, social, and conversational experiences. An analysis of observation and interview data collected from 20 people with aphasia who participated in a 5-week therapy intervention revealed key themes related to user experience. The themes offer a rich insight into aspects of the virtual world experience for PWA that go beyond therapeutic outcomes. They are as follows: affect (positive and negative); types of conversation, miscommunication, and misunderstanding; immersion in the virtual world; social presence and initiative and flow. Overall, the study showed that participants experienced positive emotional and social outcomes. We argue that this was achieved as a consequence of EVA Park being not only accessible but also a varied and entertaining environment within which PWA experienced both the realistic and the quirky while engaging with others and having fun.",10.1145/3134227,Computer Science,Aphasia; Field evaluation; Accessibility; Virtual worlds,3,3,1,Virtual World,Monitor,3+,Professional
Remote arts therapy in collaborative virtual environment: A pilot case study,"Li, C; Yip, PY",FRONTIERS IN VIRTUAL REALITY,2023,"Motivated by the unique experience of creating three-dimensional artworks in virtual reality (VR) and the need for teletherapy due to the global pandemic, we conducted this pilot case study to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using a custom-designed collaborative virtual environment (CVE) to enable remote arts therapy. Three participants (two females and one male) experiencing moderate to high stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) joined this study. Each participant had eight 45-minute one-on-one sessions with the therapist for eight consecutive weeks. These eight sessions covered eight art creation themes and were delivered following pre-designed protocols. The CVE was the only medium to facilitate the sessions, during which the therapist and the participants were physically separated into two rooms. The quantitative and qualitative results suggested that the CVE-enabled approach was generally feasible and was welcomed by both the participants and the therapist. However, more evidence of the approach's effectiveness in enhancing the participants' mental wellbeing is needed because the results of the pilot case study were affected by the pandemic. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach and the CVE were investigated from practicality and technological affordance perspectives. Potential improvements to the CVE are also proposed to better facilitate the practice of remote arts therapy in CVE. We encourage future studies to cautiously investigate CVE-enabled remote arts therapy in clinical settings and collect more evidence regarding its effectiveness in addressing clinically diagnosed mental disorders and other complications.",10.3389/frvir.2023.1059278,Computer Science,virtual reality; collaborative virtual environment; arts therapy; teletherapy; mental wellbeing; COVID-19,3,3,1,Virtual World,Virtual reality,2,Professional
Mobile Interventions for Severe Mental Illness Design and Preliminary Data From Three Approaches,"Depp, CA; Mausbach, B; Granholm, E; Cardenas, V; Ben-Zeev, D; Patterson, TL; Lebowitz, BD; Jeste, DV",JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE,2010,"Mobile devices can be used to deliver psychosocial interventions, yet there is little prior application in severe mental illness. We provide the rationale, design, and preliminary data from 3 ongoing clinical trials of mobile interventions developed for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Project 1 used a personal digital assistant to prompt engagement in personalized self-management behaviors based on real-time data. Project 2 employed experience sampling through text messages to facilitate case management. Project 3 was built on group functional skills training for schizophrenia by incorporating between-session mobile phone contacts with therapists. Preliminary findings were of minimal participant attrition, and no broken devices; yet, several operational and technical barriers needed to be addressed. Adherence was similar to that reported in nonpsychiatric populations, with high participant satisfaction. Therefore, mobile devices seem feasible and acceptable in augmenting psychosocial interventions for severe mental illness, with future research in establishing efficacy, cost effectiveness, and ethical and safety protocols.",10.1097/NMD.0b013e3181f49ea3,Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,Mobile device; severe mental illness; ambulatory monitoring; ecological momentary assessment; experience sampling method,3,3,1,Text,Mobile,2,Professional
Improving social functioning in people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders via mobile experimental interventions: Results from the CLIMB pilot trial,"Dabit, S; Quraishi, S; Jordan, J; Biagianti, B",SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH-COGNITION,2021,"Background: Patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSD) demonstrate poor social functioning. While group-based approaches show long-term improvements, access to treatments is limited. Digital platforms hold promise to overcome barriers to treatment delivery and improve outcomes. Objective: In a parallel arm, double-blind RCT, we tested CLIMB, a clinician-assisted, adjunct to treatment that includes computerized social cognition training (SCT), ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), group teletherapy, and moderated messaging. CLIMB was compared to an active control that includes computerized general cognitive training (GCT), unstructured support groups, and unmoderated messaging. Methods: The primary outcome was social functioning. Secondary outcomes were negative symptoms and quality of life (QoL). Given the sample size, Propensity Score Models were used to ensure balanced baseline covariates. Mixed-effects models examined change over time. Results: 24 participants completed the study (12 per arm). No significant between-group differences emerged in engagement. CLIMB participants engaged in a median of 8 sessions (IQR = 2), 2.8 h of SCT (IQR = 7.5), and 2710 EMAs; control participants engaged in a median of 9 sessions (IQR = 3) and 2.2 h of GCT (IQR = 7.9). As a group, participants showed significant improvements in social functioning (p = .046), with no between-group differences. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated greater improvements in QoL (p = .025) for the active control. Conclusions: Delivering group-based mobile interventions to individuals with SSD is feasible. EMAs allow clinicians to maintain inter-session engagement, build participant self-awareness, and tailor treatment delivery. In this treatment model, whether SCT or GCT is more effective remains unclear. Further research will evaluate group-based mobile interventions to improve outcomes in SSD.",10.1016/j.scog.2021.100211,Psychiatry; Psychology,"Psychosis; Social cognition; Cognitive training, mobile health",3,3,1,"Text,Video conference",Mobile,3+,"Peer "
Use of a Mobile Peer Support App Among Young People With Nonsuicidal Self-injury: Small-scale Randomized Controlled Trial,"Kruzan, KP; Whitlock, J; Bazarova, NN; Bhandari, A; Chapman, J",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a widespread behavior among adolescents and young adults. Although many individuals who self-injure do not seek treatment, there is evidence for web-based help-seeking through web-based communities and mobile peer support networks. However, few studies have rigorously tested the efficacy of such platforms on outcomes relevant for NSSI recovery. Objective: The aim of this small-scale preregistered randomized controlled trial is to provide preliminary insight into the shorterand longer-term efficacy of the use of a peer support app, TalkLife, in reducing NSSI frequency and urges and increasing readiness to change. In addition, we explore contact with informal support, interest in therapy, and attitudes toward professional help-seeking. Methods: Individuals aged 16-25 years with current (within 3 months) and chronic (>6 episodes in the past year) NSSI history were eligible to participate in this study. After baseline assessments, the intervention group was instructed to use the app actively (eg, post or comment at least three times per week) and the control group received weekly psychoeducational materials through email, for 8 weeks. Follow-up was assessed at 1 month and 2 months. Linear mixed modeling was used to evaluate condition and time point effects for the primary outcomes of NSSI frequency and urges, readiness to change, contact with informal support, interest in therapy, and attitudes toward professional help-seeking. Results: A total of 131 participants were included in the analysis. We evidenced a significant effect of condition on NSSI frequency such that the participants using the peer support app self-injured less over the course of the study (mean 1.30, SE 0.18) than those in the control condition (mean 1.62, SE 0.18; P=.02; eta(2)=0.02). We also evidenced a significant condition effect of readiness to change such that the treatment participants reported greater confidence in their ability to change their NSSI behavior (mean 6.28, SE 0.41) than the control participants (mean 5.67, SE 0.41; P=.04; eta(2)=0.02). No significant differences were observed for contact with informal support, interest in therapy, or attitudes toward professional help-seeking. Conclusions: Use of the peer support app was related to reduced NSSI frequency and greater confidence in one's ability to change NSSI behavior over the course of the study period, but no effects on NSSI urges, contact with informal support, interest in therapy, or attitudes toward professional help-seeking were observed. The findings provide preliminary support for considering the use of mobile peer support apps as a supplement to NSSI intervention and point to the need for larger-scale trials.",10.2196/26526,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,nonsuicidal self-injury; randomized controlled trial; mobile app; peer support; urges; digital intervention,3,3,1,Text,Mobile,3+,"Peer "
