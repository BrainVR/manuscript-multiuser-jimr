"""Autsome"": Fostering an Autistic Identity in an Online Minecraft Community for Youth with Autism",Good,Ringland KE.,Inf Contemp Soc (2019),2019,"Autism is a medical diagnosis that has attracted much attention in recent decades, particularly due to an increase in the numbers of children being diagnosed and the changing requirements for getting the diagnosis. In parallel online communities around autism—both those supporting individuals, families seeking treatment and those supporting embracing the autism identity—have grown. Previous literature has shown the positive impact support groups can have for those encountering hardship in their lives, such as depression. In this qualitative study of an online community for autistic children centered around a virtual world, I explore how the label “autism” can be not only a source of disenfranchisement, leading to harassment and violence—in both the virtual and physical world—but also a source of empowerment and identity. I illuminate the tension in claiming the autistic identity within this community—having a sense of identity in the community, but, in doing so, also “othering” those with autism further. The walls of the community work to keep community members safe, but also set them apart from others on the internet. I see that the Autcraft community goes beyond being a support group for victims of targeted violence, to one that redefines and helps community members embrace their own autistic identities.",10.1007/978-3-030-15742-5_12,pubmed,NA,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-15742-5_12)

"'It opened my eyes, my ears, and my heart': Codesigning a substance use disorder treatment programme",Not Multi User,"Bosak, J; Drainoni, ML; Bryer, C; Goodman, D; Messersmith, L; Declercq, E",HEALTH EXPECTATIONS,2024,"BackgroundPregnant and parenting women have low engagement and poor retention in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. The aim of this study was to analyse the implementation of an adapted experience-based codesign (EBCD) process involving SUD treatment staff and pregnant or parenting women with lived experience (WWLE) of SUD to launch a residential treatment service where women could coreside with their children and receive long term comprehensive treatment for dual diagnosis of SUD and mental illness.MethodsA process evaluation was conducted utilising five data sources: two sets of semistructured interviews with WWLE and SUD treatment staff, ethnographic observation and transcripts from group events, and meeting minutes. Based on the Integrated Promoting Action on Research in Health Services framework constructs (context, recipients, facilitation, innovation) researchers applied thematic analysis to determine main themes within each construct.ResultsThe full sample across the implementation totalled 34 individuals (WWLE = 13 and SUD staff = 21). The EBCD process engaged both cohorts and supported group cohesion and collaborative brainstorming. WWLE felt respected, emotionally safe to share, and empowered by participation. A cohesive, multidisciplinary codesign planning group, inclusive of WWLE, supported a more equitable codesign process. The need for a virtual platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic impeded human connection and relationship building. The complex environment of residential regulations and uncertainties during start-up phase of an organisation presented implementation challenges.ConclusionThese results highlight the feasibility of, and challenges to, effectively engaging WWLE in a codesign process. The findings also demonstrated a positive influence on WWLE's feelings of empowerment. Identified themes reinforce the purposeful components within EBCD that enhance participation, along with new insights to inform successful codesign with a vulnerable population. The author's team included a WWLE who collaborated throughout the full scope of the research process, enriching the overall research and ensuring the authenticity of the presentation of women in recovery's perspective. Utilising the codesign approach to design and implement new services should improve health equity by enhancing patient engagement and retention in care.Patient ContributionParenting WWLE of residential SUD treatment were involved in the full scope of the research process and the implementation being evaluated. For the actual codesign work WWLE were key members of the codesign planning team that met weekly throughout the implementation to plan, implement, problem solve and adapt the process over an 18 month timeframe. As is appropriate for codesign the actual ongoing workgroup participants had average 50% WWLE participation. For the research team, this research is a culmination of the lead author's doctoral dissertation. One member of the five-person dissertation committee was a recovery coach and a WWLE. She was an active participant across the entire research process overseeing and influencing the research design, conduct of the study, analysis, interpretation of findings and approval of the final manuscript. The findings were member checked with the larger codesign planning group that had additional WWLE members.",10.1111/hex.13908,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",addiction treatment service design; codesign; experience based codesign; i-PARIHS; pregnant and parenting women in recovery,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1111/hex.13908)
'Open Window': a randomized trial of the effect of new media art using a virtual window on quality of life in patients' experiencing stem cell transplantation,Not Digital,"McCabe, C; Roche, D; Hegarty, F; McCann, S",PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY,2013,"Objectives To measure the psychological effect of an art intervention on hospitalized patients and explore benefits to their quality of life. Methods We conducted a large prospective randomized trial between July 2006 and August 2009 of an art intervention, Open Window (OW), in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation for a hematological malignancy compared with a control group. The primary endpoint measured the effect of an art intervention on levels of anxiety, depression, and stress using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Distress Thermometer. The secondary endpoint measured the influence of OW on patients' experiences of stem cell transplantation using the OW survey and expectations questionnaires. Results Of the 199 patients in the study, 96 were randomized to the intervention group and 103 to the control group. Participants in the intervention group had significantly reduced levels of anxiety on the day before transplant (p=0.001), at day 7 (p=0.041), and day 60 (p=0.035). There was a significant reduction in depression before transplant (p=0.022). Participants in the intervention group reported better experiences (p<0.005). Qualitative data showed that those in the intervention group commented freely on their likes and dislikes about OW and how it made them feel. Conclusion An art intervention, OW, had a positive influence on health-related quality of life and patients' experiences of having a stem cell transplant.

'Take a Mental Break!' study: Role of mental aspects in running-related injuries using a randomised controlled trial,Not Multi User,"de Jonge, J; van Iperen, L; Gevers, J; Vos, S",BMJ OPEN SPORT & EXERCISE MEDICINE,2018,"Background Running-related injuries (RRIs) can be considered the primary enemy of runners. Most literature on injury prediction and prevention overlooks the mental aspects of overtraining and under-recovery, despite their potential role in injury prediction and prevention. Consequently, knowledge on the role of mental aspects in RRIs is lacking. Objective To investigate mental aspects of overtraining and under-recovery by means of an online injury prevention programme. Methods and analysis The `Take a Mental Break!' study is a randomised controlled trial with a 12 month follow-up. After completing a web-based baseline survey, half and full marathon runners were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group. Participants of the intervention group obtained access to an online injury prevention programme, consisting of a runningrelated smartphone application. This app provided the participants of the intervention group with information on how to prevent overtraining and RRIs with special attention to mental aspects. The primary outcome measure is any self-reported RRI over the past 12 months. Secondary outcome measures include vigour, fatigue, sleep and perceived running performance. Regression analysis will be conducted to investigate whether the injury prevention programme has led to a lower prevalence of RRIs, better health and improved perceived running performance. Ethics and dissemination The Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands, has exempted the current study from ethical approval (reference number: NL64342.041.17).

'Virtual experience' as an intervention before a positron emission tomography/CT scan may ease patients' anxiety and improve image quality,Not Multi User,"Sun, YY; Sun, YF; Qin, Y; Zhang, YJ; Yuan, HY; Yang, ZY",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION ONCOLOGY,2020,"Introduction The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of a 'virtual experience' on reducing people's anxiety levels and improving image quality. Methods This study included 200 people who underwent(18)F-FDG PET/CT scan for the first time. Healthy people (n = 100) and patients (n = 100) were randomly divided into a control group and an intervention group. In the intervention group, we used a 'virtual experience' as an intervention before the scan. We used the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and satisfaction questionnaires for evaluation. Additionally, the image quality was analysed. Results In the control group, more patients presented anxiety than healthy people (26(52%) versus 15(30%)) (P = 0.041). However, when the 'virtual experience' was provided, the number of cases of anxiety in the patient group decreased to 19(38%). Furthermore, patients in the intervention group had lower STAI-related scores than those in the control group (STAI-S: 37.08 +/- 9.42 versus 43.34 +/- 10.49,P = 0.109; STAI-T: 36.24 +/- 9.55 versus 40.72 +/- 9.00,P = 0.019).

(No) Effects of a Self-Kindness Intervention on Self-Esteem and Visual Self-Perception: An Eye-Tracking Investigation on the Time-Course of Self-Face Viewing,Not Multi User,"Potthoff, J; Schienle, A",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATION IN HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND EDUCATION,2023,"Previous research has suggested a favorable impact of self-kindness on subjective well-being. The present experiment investigated the effects of an app-assisted self-kindness intervention for increasing self-esteem and self-face gaze, and for decreasing depression. We explored self-face processing via a time-course analysis of eye-tracking data. Eighty participants (56 female, 24 male; mean age: 23.2 years) were randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups, each receiving daily instructions to enhance either self-kindness or relaxation (active control). Following a one-week intervention period, both groups reported improved self-esteem (p = .035, eta(2)(part) = .068) and reduced depression (p < .001, eta(2)(part) = .17). The duration of self-face gaze increased in both groups (p < .001, eta(2)(part) = .21). Self-face processing was characterized by an early automatic attention bias toward the self-face, with a subsequent reduction in self-face bias, followed in turn by an attentional self-face reapproach, and then a stable self-face bias. We thus identified a complex temporal pattern of self-face inspection, which was not specifically altered by the intervention. This research sheds light on the potential for app-assisted interventions to positively impact psychological well-being, while also highlighting the complexity of self-face processing dynamics in this context. In the future, we propose the inclusion of personalized self-kindness statements, which may amplify the benefits of these interventions.",10.3390/ejihpe13110179,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,self-face; self-kindness; self-esteem; depression; smartphone intervention; app-assisted approach; eye-tracking,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe13110179)
360° Video virtual reality exposure therapy for public speaking anxiety: A randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Reeves, R; Elliott, A; Curran, D; Dyer, K; Hanna, D",JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS,2021,"Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a prevalent condition which is highly interrelated with social anxiety. PSA can be effectively treated with exposure therapy. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is increasingly being explored as a novel and cost-effective mode of treatment. No previous randomized controlled trial has examined whether stand-alone 360 degrees video VRET is an effective intervention for treating PSA and interrelated disorder relevant fears. Further, studies have not explored whether 360 degrees video content influences VRET outcomes. Participants with high PSA (n = 51) were randomly allocated to: 360 degrees video VRET incorporating stimuli of audiences (360 degrees Audience) (n = 17), 360 degrees video VRET incorporating stimuli of empty rooms (360 degrees Empty) (n = 16) and no treatment control (n = 18). Outcomes were measured over five time-points. Mixed ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between time and intervention group for PSA, social anxiety and fear of negative evaluation (FNE). Within-group analysis demonstrated there was a significant pre-intervention to post-intervention reduction across measures for both 360 degrees video VRET groups: PSA 360 degrees Audience (eta(2)(p) = .90, p<.001), 360 degrees Empty (eta(2)(p) = .71, p < .001); social anxiety 360 degrees Audience (eta(2)(p) = .49, p=.002), 360 degrees Empty (eta(2)(p) = .39, p = .009); FNE 360 degrees Audience (eta(2)(p) = .59, p<.001), 360 degrees Empty (eta(2)(p) = .43, p = .006). Active intervention participants showed significant improvement from pre-intervention to 10-week follow-up on all measures. Findings illustrate that 360 degrees video VRET is an efficacious way to significantly reduce PSA, social anxiety and FNE.",10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102451,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Psychiatry,Virtual reality; Exposure therapy; Technology delivered interventions; Public speaking anxiety; Social anxiety,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102451)
A 12-month comparison of brief psychodynamic psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment in subjects with generalised anxiety disorders in a community setting,Good,"Ferrero, A; Pierò, A; Fassina, S; Massola, T; Lanteri, A; Daga, GA; Fassino, S",EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY,2007,"Little information is available on the use of brief psychotherapy among subjects with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) within community mental health services. This study compared results among subjects treated with brief Adlerian psychodynamic psychotherapy (B-APP), those treated with medication (MED), or those who experienced combined treatment (COM). Symptomatology and occupational functioning were assessed using the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression scales (HAM-A; HAM-D), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) at intake (T1) and at 3, 6, and 12 months later (T3, T6, T12). The study sample included 87 patients with GAD (B-APP 34: MED 33; COM 20), and an ANOVA was applied for analysing repeated measures while controlling for personality disorder. After 6 months, CGI, HAM-A, HAM-D. and SOFAS scores significantly improved independently from the type of treatment. Subjects with personality disorders treated with B-APP exhibited superior results to those treated using other methods only in SOFAS scores at T6. These results were generally maintained at T12. Remission rates among subjects (HAM-A scores < 7) varied between 55% (MED) and 74% (B-APP) at T6 and between 63% (MED) and 78% (COM) at T12; no significant differences appeared between the three treatment groups. A logistic regression model predicted anxiety remission only by CGI at T1. This paper discusses these results in relation to the use of brief psychotherapy within community mental health services.

"A 6-Month Randomized Trial of a Smartphone Application, UControlDrink, in Aiding Recovery in Alcohol Use Disorder",Not Digital,"Farren, C; Farrell, A; Hagerty, A; McHugh, C",EUROPEAN ADDICTION RESEARCH,2022,"Background and Aims: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a substantial problem, causing early death and great economic burden. Research has highlighted the potential positive impact of technological interventions, such as smartphone applications (app) in treatment of AUD. The aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of a smartphone app, incorporating computerized cognitive behavioural therapy and text messaging support, on alcohol outcomes over 6 months in a post-rehabilitation setting. Methods: A total of 111 participants with AUD were recruited into this randomized controlled trial, following completion of a 30-day rehabilitation programme. The intervention group (n = 54) used the smartphone app UControlDrink (UCD) over 6 months with treatment as usual (TAU), and the control group (n = 57) received TAU. All subjects suffered from AUD as the primary disorder, with other major psychiatric disorders excluded. All intervention subjects used the UCD smartphone app in the treatment trial, and all subjects underwent TAU consisting of outpatient weekly support groups. Drinking history in the previous 90 days was measured at baseline and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Additional measurements were made to assess mood, anxiety, craving, and motivation. Results were analysed using intention-to-treat analyses. Results: Retention in the study was 72% at 3 months and 52% at 6 months. There was a significant reduction in heavy drinking days in the intervention group relative to TAU over the 6 months, p < 0.02. Conclusions: The UCD smartphone app demonstrates a significant benefit to reducing heavy drinking days over a 6-month post-rehabilitation period in AUD.",10.1159/000519945,"pubmed, wos",Substance Abuse; Psychiatry,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1159/000519945)
A Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Driving for Autistic Teens and Adults: A Pilot Study,Not Multi User,"Baker-Ericzén, MJ; Smith, L; Tran, A; Scarvie, K",AUTISM IN ADULTHOOD,2021,"Background: For many autistic individuals approaching adulthood, interventions to promote skills toward independence are lacking. Driving is an important ability to cultivate as it may be a critical step to attaining independence, securing and maintaining work, and fostering relationships. Only about one third of able autistic individuals drive independently, and fear to drive is a common reason for not driving. Methods: This initial pilot study was a 3-month open trial to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial estimates of outcomes for the newly developed Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Driving (CBID) intervention, a manualized curriculum to enhance executive functioning (EF) and emotional regulation (ER) skill development for driving, combined with individualized commentary-based driving simulator practice, in autistic teens and adults within a community research environment. Nineteen participants received the CBID intervention in 1.5-hour group sessions for 10 weeks, across two cohorts, with approximately five individualized driving simulator sessions. Data were collected on anxiety symptoms, driving cognitions, driving attitudes, and simulated driving performance at pre- and post-intervention assessments. Results: Program completion rate was 81%. Participants and parents rated both the intervention and simulator practice sessions with high satisfaction. All the participants (100%) reported both a positive attitude change (interest toward driving) and a desire to drive in the future at the post-intervention assessment. Significant changes occurred for driving cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors, and 47% of participants obtained a driver's permit or license by 2 months post-intervention. Conclusions: For autistic individuals, the CBID intervention appeared to directly impact the pursuit toward driving goals by both increasing driving attitudes and behaviors and reducing anxiety/apprehension. This highlights the need for driving intervention programs designed specific to autistic teens/adults that focus on EF and ER skills coupled with individualized simulator practice. CBID could be provided in community services to increase the number of autistic individuals driving. Lay summary Why was this study done? Driving contributes greatly to independence in many teens and adults. Anxiety can act as a barrier to that independence by affecting driving attitudes, ability and performance. Autistic individuals are often affected by anxiety, executive functioning, and emotion regulation challenges. Previous studies show that virtual reality training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), separately, can reduce driving anxiety in autistic individuals and support driving skills. However, to date, no studies have developed and tested a manualized intervention specific to driving that combines such methods. What was the purpose of this study? The goal of this study was to develop and test a group intervention, called Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Driving (CBID), combined with individualized, coached driving simulator practice to help reduce fears and increase cognitions, attitudes and performance towards driving. The study examined the following questions: 1) Do autistic individuals actively participate in CBID? 2) Do autistic participants like CBID? and 3) Are autistic participants more prepared to drive after taking part in CBID than they were before they participated in the program? What did the researchers do? After developing the CBID intervention with community member involvement, the researchers ran 2 intervention groups and individualized driving simulator sessions to a total of 19 enrolled participants. The group intervention focused on strengthening executive functioning and emotion regulation skills in 1.5 hour sessions over 10 weeks and 5, 1 hour driving simulator sessions. Researchers compared data on participant anxiety levels, driving cognitions, attitudes, and performance before and after the intervention. What were the results of the study? Most of the participants completed the program (81%) and all (100%) rated satisfaction with the group and simulator practice. All (100%) of the participants changed attitudes towards driving. Participants had higher levels of positive thoughts about driving, better attitudes towards wanting to drive and less driving errors (like speeding, collisions, crossing lanes) on the driving simulator after completing CBID. Almost half (47%) of participants obtained a driver's permit or license by 2 months after the intervention. What do these findings add to what was already known? This study adds a new option of an integrated approach, CBID, for addressing driving anxiety or apprehension. It provides initial findings of the value of incorporating executive functioning skills with traditional cognitive behavior therapy for enhancing driving readiness. What are the potential weaknesses in the study? This study contained a small sample size that was mostly white male participants. This limits generalizing the results to a representative diverse population. It also did not have a control group or use randomization which means that results can't be interpreted as causal at this time. There was no information about participants obtaining permit/licensure later than 2 months after CBID so it is unclear if some participants require more time to pursue a license. There was no follow up to understand if participants continued to feel comfortable driving overtime. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? This study showed that it's possible to combine virtual reality training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy into one driving readiness program. The new CBID program may help autistic adults by addressing multiple aspects of what they need to be ready to drive. Since the study used previously tested strategies, enrolled a community sample, manualized the program, and used a services approach, it was designed for broad distribution to other community settings.",10.1089/aut.2020.0009,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Rehabilitation,autism; teen; adults; driving anxiety intervention; cognitive behavioral therapy; executive functioning,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1089/aut.2020.0009)

A Customized Social Network Platform (Kids Helpline Circles) for Delivering Group Counseling to Young People Experiencing Family Discord That Impacts Their Well-Being: Exploratory Study,Good,"Campbell, A; Ridout, B; Amon, K; Navarro, P; Collyer, B; Dalgleish, J",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: It has often been reported that young people are at high risk of mental health concerns, more so than at any other time in development over their life span. The situational factors that young people report as impacting their well-being are not addressed as often: specifically, family discord. Kids Helpline, a national service in Australia that provides free counseling online and by telephone to young people in distress, report that family discord and well-being issues are one of the major concerns reported by clients. In order to meet the preferences that young people seek when accessing counseling support, Kids Helpline has designed and trialed a custom-built social network platform for group counseling of young people experiencing family discord that impacts their well-being.

This will lead to an iterative design for a world-first, purpose-built social network that will do the following: (1) increase reach and quality of service by utilizing a digital tool of preference for youth to receive peer-to-peer and counselor-to-peer support in a safe online environment and (2) provide the evidence base to document the best practice for online group counseling in a social network environment. Methods: The study utilized a participatory action research design. Young people aged 13-25 years (N=105) with mild-to-moderate depression or anxiety (not high risk) who contacted Kids Helpline were asked if they would like to trial the social networking site (SNS) for peer-to-peer and counselor-to-peer group support. Subjects were grouped into age cohorts of no more than one year above or below their reported age and assigned to groups of no more than 36 participants, in order to create a community of familiarity around age and problems experienced. Each group entered into an 8-week group counseling support program guided by counselors making regular posts and providing topic-specific content for psychoeducation and discussion. Counselors provided a weekly log of events to researchers; at 2-week intervals, subjects provided qualitative and quantitative feedback through open-ended questions and specific psychometric measures. Results: Qualitative results provided evidence of user support and benefits of the online group counseling environment. Counselors also reported benefits of the modality of therapy delivery. Psychometric scales did not report significance in changes of mood or affect. Counselors and users suggested improvements to the platform to increase user engagement. Conclusions: Phase 1 provided proof of concept for this mode of online counseling delivery. Users and counselors saw value in the model and innovation of the service. Phase 2 will address platform issues with changes to a new social network platform.",10.2196/16176,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,social media; social networking; online counseling; family discord; well-being,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/16176)
A Cyberbullying Media-Based Prevention Intervention for Adolescents on Instagram: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Kutok, ER; Dunsiger, S; Patena, JV; Nugent, NR; Riese, A; Rosen, RK; Ranney, ML",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2021,"Background: Between 15% and 70% of adolescents report experiencing cybervictimization Cybervictimization is associated with multiple negative consequences, including depressed mood. Few validated, easily disseminated interventions exist to prevent cybervictimization and its consequences. With over 97% of adolescents using social media (such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat), recruiting and delivering a prevention intervention through social media and apps may improve accessibility of prevention tools for at-risk youth. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of and obtain preliminary outcome data on IMPACT (Intervention Media to Prevent Adolescent Cyber-Conflict Through Technology), a brief, remote app-based intervention to prevent and reduce the effect of cyberbullying. Methods: From January 30, 2020, to May 3, 2020, a national sample of 80 adolescents with a history of past-year cybervictimization was recruited through Instagram for a randomized control trial of IMPACT, a brief, remote research assistant-led intervention and a fully automated app-based program, versus enhanced web-based resources (control). Feasibility and acceptability were measured by consent, daily use, and validated surveys. Although not powered for efficacy, outcomes (victimization, bystander self-efficacy, and well-being) were measured using validated measures at 8 and 16 weeks and evaluated using a series of longitudinal mixed models. Results: Regarding feasibility, 24.5% (121/494) of eligible participants provided contact information; of these, 69.4% (84/121) completed full enrollment procedures. Of the participants enrolled, 45% (36/80) were randomized into the IMPACT intervention and 55% (44/80) into the enhanced web-based resources groups. All participants randomized to the intervention condition completed the remote intervention session, and 89% (77/80) of the daily prompts were answered. The retention rate was 99% (79/80) at 8 weeks and 96% (77/80) at 16 weeks for all participants. Regarding acceptability, 100% (36/36) of the intervention participants were at least moderately satisfied with IMPACT overall, and 92% (33/36) of the participants were at least moderately satisfied with the app. At both 8 and 16 weeks, well-being was significantly higher (beta=1.17, SE 0.87, P=.02 at 8 weeks and beta=3.24, SE 0.95, P<.001 at 16 weeks) and psychological stress was lower (beta=-.66, SE 0.08, P=.04 at 8 weeks and (beta=-.89, SE 0.09, P<.001 at 16 weeks) among IMPACT users than among control group users. Participants in the intervention group attempted significantly more bystander interventions than those in the control group at 8 weeks (beta=.82, SE 0.42; P=.02). Conclusions: This remote app-based intervention for victims of cyberbullying was feasible and acceptable, increased overall well-being and bystander interventions, and decreased psychological stress. Our findings are especially noteworthy given that the trial took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of Instagram to recruit adolescents can be a successful strategy for identifying and intervening with those at the highest risk of cybervictimization.",10.2196/26029,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,cyberbullying; adolescents; mobile application; messaging; brief interventions; social media; recruitment; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/26029)
A Digital Game and School-Based Intervention for Students in Hong Kong: Quasi-Experimental Design,Not mental health,"Shum, AKY; Lai, ESY; Leung, WG; Cheng, MNS; Wong, HK; So, SWK; Law, YW; Yip, PSF",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: In Hong Kong, with an increasing number of children experiencing mental health issues, there is a need to not only develop innovative interventions but also develop comprehensive prevention interventions so as to reduce their anxiety symptoms and enhance their emotional management and interpersonal relationships. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of The Adventures of DoReMiFa, an integration model of the cognitive-behavioral approach and positive psychology by using digital game-based and school-based mental health enhancement intervention to magnify the social and emotional health and well-being of the school children in Hong Kong aged 9 to 11 years. Methods: A quasi-experimental design method was used to evaluate this digital game and school-based intervention. The Adventures of DoReMiFa was piloted in 4 primary schools where students were allocated to either an intervention or a control group. The participants were assessed at pre- and postintervention with a 6-month follow-up measuring their mental health knowledge, levels of anxiety symptoms, positive and negative thinking, perspective-taking, and self-esteem. Results: A total of 459 primary school students from 4 primary schools participated in the study. The response rate on the questionnaires answered on the Web was up to 85.1% (391/459). Compared with the control group, the intervention group was found to have significant association with improved mental health knowledge at the time immediately after the intervention (beta=.46; P=.01) and in the 6-month postintervention period (beta=.66; P<.001); for perspective-taking, the intervention group had exhibited a significant improvement 6 months after the completion of the universal program (beta=1.50; P=.03). The intervention, however, was found not to be effective in reducing the rates of anxiety symptoms and negative thinking among the participating students. Conclusions: The Adventures of DoReMiFa, an integration of a digital game-based and school-based mental health enhancement intervention, was shown to be effective in elevating the knowledge of mental health and promoting perspective-taking in the primary school students of Hong Kong. Although there was insufficient evidence to support a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and negative automatic thoughts, the overall results were still encouraging in that a preventive effect was found, indicating that the program has the potential to enhance the mental well-being of schoolchildren. It also suggests that knowledge enhancement may not necessarily lead to behavior change, and more focused effort may be needed to achieve the translation.

A Digital Health Intervention for Stress and Anxiety Relief in Perioperative Care: Protocol for a Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial,Not mental health,"Kondylakis, H; Giglioli, IAC; Katehakis, DG; Aldemir, H; Zikas, P; Papagiannakis, G; Hors-Fraile, S; González-Sanz, PL; Apostolakis, KC; Stephanidis, C; Núñez-Benjumea, FJ; Baños-Rivera, RM; Fernandez-Luque, L; Kouroubali, A",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2022,"Background: Stress and anxiety are psychophysiological responses commonly experienced by patients during the perioperative process that can increase presurgical and postsurgical complications to a comprehensive and positive recovery. Preventing and intervening in stress and anxiety can help patients achieve positive health and well-being outcomes. Similarly, the provision of education about surgery can be a crucial component and is inversely correlated with preoperative anxiety levels. However, few patients receive stress and anxiety relief support before surgery, and resource constraints make face-to-face education sessions untenable. Digital health interventions can be helpful in empowering patients and enhancing a more positive experience. Digital health interventions have been shown to help patients feel informed about the possible benefits and risks of available treatment options. However, they currently focus only on providing informative content, neglecting the importance of personalization and patient empowerment.Objective: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of a digital health intervention called the Adhera CARINAE Digital Health Program, designed to provide evidence-based, personalized stress-and anxiety-management methods enabled by a comprehensive digital ecosystem that incorporates wearable, mobile, and virtual reality technologies. The intervention program includes the use of advanced data-driven techniques for tailored patient education and lifestyle support.Methods: The trial will include 5 hospitals across 3 European countries and will use a randomized controlled design including 30 intervention participants and 30 control group participants. The involved surgeries are cardiopulmonary and coronary artery bypass surgeries, cardiac valve replacement, prostate or bladder cancer surgeries, hip and knee replacement, maxillofacial surgery, or scoliosis. The control group will receive standard care, and the intervention group will additionally be exposed to the digital health intervention program.Results: The recruitment process started in January 2022 and has been completed. The primary impact analysis is currently ongoing. The expected results will be published in early 2023.Conclusions: This manuscript details a comprehensive protocol for a study that will provide valuable information about the intervention program, such as the measurement of comparative intervention effects on stress; anxiety and pain management; and usability by patients, caregivers, and health care professionals. This will contribute to the evidence planning process for the future adoption of diverse digital health solutions in the field of surgery.

A Digital Human for Delivering a Remote Loneliness and Stress Intervention to At-Risk Younger and Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Randomized Pilot Trial,Not Multi User,"Loveys, K; Sagar, M; Pickering, I; Broadbent, E",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2021,"Background: Loneliness is a growing public health issue that has been exacerbated in vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer agents are capable of delivering psychological therapies through the internet; however, there is limited research on their acceptability to date. Objective: The objectives of this study were to evaluate (1) the feasibility and acceptability of a remote loneliness and stress intervention with digital human delivery to at-risk adults and (2) the feasibility of the study methods in preparation for a randomized controlled trial. Methods: A parallel randomized pilot trial with a mixed design was conducted. Participants were adults aged 18 to 69 years with an underlying medical condition or aged 70 years or older with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of >24 (ie, at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19). Participants took part from their place of residence (independent living retirement village, 20; community dwelling, 7; nursing home, 3). Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention or waitlist control group that received the intervention 1 week later. The intervention involved completing cognitive behavioral and positive psychology exercises with a digital human facilitator on a website for at least 15 minutes per day over 1 week. The exercises targeted loneliness, stress, and psychological well-being. Feasibility was evaluated using dropout rates and behavioral observation data. Acceptability was evaluated from behavioral engagement data, the Friendship Questionnaire (adapted), self-report items, and qualitative questions. Psychological measures were administered to evaluate the feasibility of the trial methods and included the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale, a 1-item COVID-19 distress measure, the Flourishing Scale, and the Scale of Positive and Negative Experiences. Results: The study recruited 30 participants (15 per group). Participants were 22 older adults and 8 younger adults with a health condition. Six participants dropped out of the study. Thus, the data of 24 participants were analyzed (intervention group, 12; waitlist group, 12). The digital human intervention and trial methods were generally found to be feasible and acceptable in younger and older adults living independently, based on intervention completion, and behavioral, qualitative, and some self-report data. The intervention and trial methods were less feasible to nursing home residents who required caregiver assistance. Acceptability could be improved with additional content, tailoring to the population, and changes to the digital human's design. Conclusions: Digital humans are a promising and novel technological solution for providing at-risk adults with access to remote psychological support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research should further examine design techniques to improve their acceptability in this application and investigate intervention effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial.",10.2196/31586,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,COVID-19; loneliness; stress; well-being; eHealth; digital human; conversational agent; older adults; chronic illness,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/31586)
A Digital Intervention Addressing Alcohol Use Problems (the Daybreak Program): Quasi-Experimental Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Tait, RJ; Castro, RP; Kirkman, JJL; Moore, JC; Schaub, MP",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: Alcohol use is prevalent in many societies and has major adverse impacts on health, but the availability of effective interventions limits treatment options for those who want assistance in changing their patterns of alcohol use. Objective: This study evaluated the new Daybreak program, which is accessible via mobile app and desktop and was developed by Hello Sunday Morning to support high-risk drinking individuals looking to change their relationship with alcohol. In particular, we compared the effect of adding online coaching via real-time chat messages (intervention group) to an otherwise self-guided program (control group). Methods: We designed the intervention as a randomized control trial, but as some people (n=48; 11.9%) in the control group were able to use the online coaching, the main analysis comprised all participants. We collected online surveys at one-month and three-months follow-up. The primary outcome was change in alcohol risk (measured with the alcohol use disorders identification test-consumption [AUDIT-C] score), but other outcomes included the number of standard drinks per week, alcohol-related days out of role, psychological distress (Kessler-10), and quality of life (EUROHIS-QOL). Markers of engagement with the program included posts to the site and comments on the posts of others. The primary analysis used Weighted Generalized Estimating Equations. Results: We recruited 398 people to the intervention group (50.2%) and 395 people to the control group (49.8%). Most were female (71%) and the mean age was 40.1 years. Most participants were classified as probably dependent (550, 69%) on the AUDIT-10, with 243 (31%) classified with hazardous or harmful consumption. We followed up with 334 (42.1%) participants at one month and 293 (36.9%) at three months. By three months there were significant improvements in AUDIT-C scores (down from mean 9.1 [SD 1.9] to 5.8 [SD 3.1]), alcohol consumed per week (down from mean 37.1 [SD 28.3] to mean 17.5 [SD 18.9]), days out of role (down from mean 1.6 [SD 3.6] to 0.5 [SD 1.6]), quality of life (up from 3.2 [SD 0.7] to 3.6 [SD 0.7]) and reduced distress (down from 24.8 [SD 7.0] to 19.0 [SD 6.6]). Accessing online coaching was not associated with improved outcomes, but engagement with the program (eg, posts and comments on the posts of others) were significantly associated with improvements (eg, in AUDIT-C, alcohol use and EUROHIS-QOL). Reduced alcohol use was found for both probably dependent (estimated marginal mean of 40.8 to 20.1 drinks) and hazardous or harmful alcohol users (estimated marginal mean of 22.9 to 11.9 drinks). Conclusions: Clinically significant reductions in alcohol use were found, as well as reduced alcohol risk (AUDIT-C) and days out of role. Importantly, improved alcohol-related outcomes were found for both hazardous or harmful and probably dependent drinkers. Since October 2016, Daybreak has reached more than 50,000 participants. Therefore, there is the potential for the program to have an impact on alcohol-related problems at a population health level, importantly including an effect on probably dependent drinkers.",10.2196/14967,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,alcohol consumption; internet; intervention study; social marketing; health promotion,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/14967)
A Digital Intervention for Respiratory Tract Infections (Internet Dr): Process Evaluation to Understand How to Support Self-care for Minor Ailments,Not mental health,"Miller, S; Yardley, L; Smith, P; Weal, M; Anderson, A; Stuart, B; Little, P; Morrison, L",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Approximately 57 million physician appointments annually in the United Kingdom are for minor ailments. These illnesses could be self-cared for, which would potentially lower patients' anxiety, increase their confidence, and be more convenient. In a randomized controlled trial of the Internet Dr digital intervention, patients with access to the intervention had fewer consultations for respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Having established intervention efficacy, further examination of trial data is required to understand how the intervention works. Objective: This paper reports a process evaluation of Internet Dr usage by the intervention group. The evaluation aims to demonstrate how meaningful usage metrics (ie, interactions that are specific and relevant to the intervention) can be derived from the theoretical principles underlying the intervention, then applied to examine whether these interactions are effective in supporting self-care for RTIs, for whom, and at what time. Methods: The Internet Dr trial recorded patients' characteristics and usage data over 24 weeks. At follow-up, users reported whether their levels of enablement to cope with their illness changed over the trial period. The Medical Research Council process evaluation guidance and checklists from the framework for Analyzing and Measuring Usage and Engagement Data were applied to structure research questions examining associations between usage and enablement. Results: Viewing pages containing advice on caring for RTIs were identified as a meaningful metric for measuring intervention usage. Almost half of the users (616/1491, 42.31%) viewed at least one advice page, with most people (478/616, 77.6%) accessing them when they initially enrolled in the study. Users who viewed an advice page reported increased enablement to cope with their illness as a result of having participated in the study compared with users who did not (mean 2.12, SD 2.92 vs mean 1.65, SD 3.10; mean difference 0.469, 95% CI 0.082-0.856). The target population was users who had visited their general practitioners for an RTI in the year before the trial, and analyses revealed that this group was more likely to access advice pages (odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.159-1.571; P<.001). Conclusions: The process evaluation identifies viewing advice pages as associated with increased enablement to self-care, even when accessed in the absence of a RTI, meaning that dissemination activities need not be restricted to targeting users who are ill. The intervention was effective at reaching the target population of users who had previously consulted their general practitioners. However, attrition before reaching advice pages was high, highlighting the necessity of prioritizing access during the design phase. These findings provide guidance on how the intervention may be improved and disseminated and have wider implications for minor ailment interventions.",10.2196/24239,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,illness behavior; self-care; internet; evaluation studies; respiratory tract infection; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/24239)
A Digital Lifestyle Program in Outpatient Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Study,Not mental health,"Hilmarsdóttir, E; Sigurdardóttir, AK; Arnardóttir, RH",JOURNAL OF DIABETES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,2021,"Background: Lifestyle is important in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study's aim was to investigate whether a healthy-lifestyle-supporting smartphone application could affect treatment outcomes at an endocrinology outpatient clinic. Methods: Consecutively invited patients were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group after age and gender stratification. In addition to standard care, intervention group participants used a smartphone application to access a lifestyle program (SidekickHealth) through which they received personalized recommendations and education about healthy lifestyles. Tests at baseline and every other month for six months included body weight and blood tests for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood lipids, as well as questionnaires about distress related to diabetes, health-related quality of life, depression, and anxiety. Statistics included comparisons both within and between groups. Results: A total of 37 patients (23 women) were included, whereof 30 finished, 15 in each group (19% dropout); the average age was 51.2 +/- 10.6 (25-70) years. No significant differences emerged between groups, but within the intervention group, there was a significant decrease in HbA1c from 61 +/- 21.4 to 52.7 +/- 15.2mmol/mol, in disease-specific distress from 19.5 +/- 16.5 to 11.7 +/- 13.4, and in anxiety symptoms from 5.4 +/- 4.0 to 4.1 +/- 3.8. No significant changes occurred within the control group. The application usage was most frequent during the first months and differed interpersonally. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the SidekickHealth digital lifestyle program could potentially enhance outpatient treatment in T2DM, in terms of both glycemic control and psychological well-being but larger confirmative studies are needed.",10.1177/1932296820942286,"pubmed, wos",Endocrinology & Metabolism,e-health; health-related quality of life; intervention; lifestyle; smartphone apps; type 2 diabetes,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1177/1932296820942286)
A Digital Peer Support Platform to Translate Online Peer Support for Emerging Adult Mental Well-being: Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Yeo, G; Loo, G; Oon, M; Pang, R; Ho, D",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2023,"Background: Emerging adulthood (ages 19 to 25 years) is a developmental phase that is marked by increased mental health conditions, especially depression and anxiety. A growing body of work indicates that digital peer emotional support has positive implications for the psychological functioning of emerging adults. There is burgeoning interest among health care professionals, educational stakeholders, and policy makers in understanding the implementation and clinical effectiveness, as well as the associated mechanism of change, of digital peer support as an intervention.Objective: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the effectiveness of a digital peer support intervention over a digital platform-Acceset-for emerging adult psychological well-being with 3 primary aims. First, we evaluated the implementation effectiveness of digital peer support training for individuals providing support (befrienders) and of the digital platform for peer support. Second, we assessed the clinical outcomes of digital peer support in terms of the intervening effect on emerging adult psychological well-being. Third, we investigated the mechanism of change linking the digital peer support intervention to emerging adult psychological well-being.Methods: This RCT involving 100 emerging adults from the National University of Singapore follows the published protocol for this trial.Results: This RCT found effectiveness in digital peer support training-specifically, befrienders' peer support responses demonstrating significantly higher post-than pretraining scores in selfhood (posttraining score: mean 62.83, SD 10.18, and SE 1.72; pretraining score: mean 54.86, SD 7.32, and SE 1.24; t34=3.88; P<.001). The digital peer support intervention demonstrated clinical effectiveness in enhancing selfhood, compassion, and mindfulness and lowering depressive and anxiety symptoms among seekers in the intervention group after the intervention (mean 7.15, SD 5.14; SE 0.88) than among seekers in the waitlist control group before the intervention (mean 11.75, SD 6.72; SE 0.89; t89=3.44; P<.001). The effect of the intervention on seekers' psychological well-being was sustained beyond the period of the intervention. The mechanism of change revealed that seekers' engagement with the intervention had both immediate and prospective implications for their psychological well-being.Conclusions: This RCT of a digital peer support intervention for emerging adult psychological well-being harnesses the interventional potential of 4 components of psychological well-being and elucidated a mechanism of change. By incorporating and validating the digital features and process of a peer support platform, our RCT provides the parameters and conditions for deploying an effective and novel digital peer support intervention for emerging adult psychological well-being in real-world settings.",10.2196/43956,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,mental health; digital health; peer support intervention; peer emotional disclosure; randomized controlled trial,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/43956)
A Digital Preprocedure Instruction Program for Outpatient Colonoscopy,Other,"Richter, JM; Ha, JB; Marx, M; Campbell, EJ; Pandolfi, MC",TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH,2020,"Introduction: Many patients struggle with colonoscopy preparation, which is complex and can be an uncomfortable as well as a time-consuming process. The confusion and anxiety from the preprocedure process may lead patients to delay their colonoscopy or skip it altogether. Digital health technology that focuses on patient engagement can play an important role in promoting colorectal cancer screening. Methods: A digital preprocedure instruction program was implemented for outpatient colonoscopy by sending critical reminders and instructions to patients through a series of short message service messages and/or emails. Eligible patients included English speakers on GoLYTELY (R)/NuLYTELY (R) or MiraLAX (R) preparation regimens with a valid cellphone or email address in the electronic health record. We examined the impact of digital instructions on bowel preparation quality, no-show and same-day cancellations over a 3-month period between an intervention group of 756 patients and a control group of 2,103 patients. Patients who enrolled in the digital instructions also received a patient satisfaction survey. Results: Our controlled study demonstrated the effectiveness of digital instructions to reduce no-show and same-day cancellation rates for outpatient colonoscopy from 10.40% to 6.08% (p < 0.001). Bowel preparation quality was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.23). However, 90% of patients who enrolled in the program rated their satisfaction with the digital reminders very highly. Discussion: A digital preprocedure instruction program can have a positive impact on operational efficiency, quality of care, and patient satisfaction. This study shows how digital health tools can effectively engage patients scheduled for a colonoscopy, increase appointment adherence, and, therefore, lead to better cancer screening.",10.1089/tmj.2019.0050,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services,e-health; telemedicine; telehealth; education; technology,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2019.0050)
A Digital Program (Hope) for People Living With Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial,Not mental health,"Wright, H; Martin, F; Clyne, W; Clark, CCT; McGillion, M; Matouskova, G; Turner, A",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2020,"Background: During the COVID-19 lockdown period in the United Kingdom that began on March 23, 2020, more than a quarter of a million people with cancer reported worsening mental health. Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (Hope) is a self-management program for people with cancer, designed to provide support for distress, unmet needs, and poor psychological health. In light of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital delivery of the Hope Programme has become ever more vital for people with cancer. Previous pre-post studies of the digital Hope Programme have found reduced anxiety and depression and improved well-being for people with cancer. However, evaluation of this evidence has been limited by the lack of a control group in these previous studies. Objective: We now present a protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial of the digital Hope Programme for people with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes will be recruitment, dropout, and adherence rates, and estimations of sample and effect size. To detect signals of efficacy, secondary outcomes will be participant mental health and well-being. Methods: Participants will be recruited by Macmillan Cancer Support (MCS) through their social media networks. The study will employ a feasibility wait-list randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, with people with cancer being randomized to join the digital Hope Programme immediately (intervention group [IG]) or join a 6-week waiting list (wait-list control group [WLCG]) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants will complete digital measures of depression, anxiety, mental well-being, and confidence in managing their own health. Online questionnaires will be administered preprogram and 6 weeks postprogram. Results: All people who had requested access to the Hope Programme from MCS (N=61) will be invited to participate in the trial. Baseline data collection commenced in April 2020, and the Hope Programme began for the IG in May 2020 and for the WLCG in June 2020. Postprogram data collection was completed by the end of August 2020. Conclusions: This feasibility study will provide data to inform the design of a future definitive trial.

Participants were randomized into an intervention group (IG) or a waitlist CG. The intervention was a 6-week digital self-management program, Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (HOPE), for people with cancer. Objective: This study aims to test the feasibility of a digitally delivered self-management program for people with cancer. This will inform the design of a definitive randomized controlled trial. In addition, a preliminary assessment of the impact of the HOPE program via secondary outcomes will be used to assess signals of efficacy in a trial context. Methods: Participants were drawn from an opportunity sample, referred by Macmillan Cancer Support, and were invited via email to participate in the study (N=61). Primary outcomes were rates of recruitment, retention, follow-up, completion and adherence, sample size and effect size estimation, and assessment of progression criteria for a definitive trial. Secondary outcomes were self-report measures of participants' positive mental well-being, depression, anxiety, and patient activation (ie, confidence in managing their cancer).

A total of 41 participants completed the baseline questionnaires and were randomized to either the IG (n=21) or the waitlist CG (n=20). The retention rate (attending all program sessions) was greater than 50% (all: 21/41, 51%, IG: 10/21, 48%; and CG: 11/20, 55%). The follow-up rate (completing all questionnaires) was greater than 80% (all: 33/41, 80%; IG: 16/21, 76%; and CG: 17/20, 85%). The completion rate (attending >= 3 sessions and completing all questionnaires) was greater than 60% (all: 25/41, 61%; IG: 13/21, 62%; and CG: 12/20, 60%). Engagement data showed that participants viewed between half (5.1/10, 51%) and three-quarters (12.2/16, 76%) of the pages in each session. Conclusions: All progression criteria for a definitive trial were met, as supported by the primary outcome data. The IG showed improved postprogram scores on measures of positive mental well-being, depression, anxiety, and patient activation.

A Dyadic Pain Management Program for Community-Dwelling Older Adults with Chronic Pain: Study Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,Other,"Tse, MMY; Ng, SSM; Lou, V; Lo, R; Cheung, DSK; Lee, P; Tang, ASK",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,2022,"Community-dwelling older adults suffer from chronic pain. Pain negatively affects their physical and psychosocial wellbeing. The majority of pain management education and programs focus only on older adults. Their informal caregivers should be involved in pain management. A dyadic pain management program for reducing pain and psychological health symptoms, and improving pain self-efficacy, quality of life, and physical function in older adults is proposed for evaluation of its effectiveness. This will be a cluster randomized controlled trial. Community-dwelling older adults aged 60 or above and their informal caregivers will be recruited. The dyadic pain management program will be an eight-week group-based program. The participants in the experimental group will receive four weeks of center-based, face-to-face activities and four weeks of digital-based activities via a WhatsApp group. The control group will receive the usual care and a pain management pamphlet. Data will be collected at baseline, and at the eighth-week and sixteenth-week follow-up session. The outcome measurements will include pain intensity, pain self-efficacy, perceived quality of life, depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Data on the caregiver burden will be collected from the informal caregivers. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, all social activities have been suspended.

A Feasibility Study to Develop and Test a Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management Mobile Health Application for HIV-Related Fatigue,Not Multi User,"Barroso, J; Madisetti, M; Mueller, M",JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT,2020,"Context. Exacerbated by life stressors, fatigue is the most common symptom for people living with HIV. Objective. To adapt, develop, and assess the feasibility of a Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management Mobile Health (CBSM mHealth) application (app) for HIV-related fatigue. Methods. This study had two phases: app development with key informants (N = 5) and a randomized controlled trial (N = 30). Patients randomized to the intervention group completed 10 weekly CBSM modules; those in the control group received a generic healthy lifestyle app. Measures included HIV-related fatigue, depression, anxiety, stressful life events, CD4 count, HIV viral load, credibility and acceptability of the intervention, and barriers to treatment participation. Results. We were able to recruit participants for this study, and they were able to complete the required measures. They found the intervention to be credible and acceptable and reported few barriers to treatment participation. The direction of change in the primary outcome, a decrease in fatigue, is in the expected direction and provides evidence of the promise of the intervention, which still needs to be tested in an adequately powered trial. For completers (randomized to the intervention group and completed at least 80% of the modules), there were significant changes (95% CI; lower scores indicate improvement) in fatigue intensity (from 64.2 to 59.7) and overall fatigue-related functioning (from 6.6 to 4.2). Conclusion. We have proof of concept as to the feasibility, acceptability, and initial signals of efficacy for an mHealth intervention to help people with HIV-related fatigue better cope with stress and reduce their fatigue.

"A Feasibility Study: Testing Whether a Sleep Application Providing Objective Sleep Data to Physicians Improves Patient-Physician Communication Regarding Sleep Experiences, Habits, and Behaviors",Not mental health,"Durrani, S; Cao, S; Bo, N; Pai, JK; Baker, J; Rawlings, L; Qureshi, ZP; Sigua, NL; Manchanda, S; Khan, B",ADVANCES IN THERAPY,2022,"Introduction Sleep tracker data have not been utilized routinely in sleep-related disorders and their management. Sleep-related disorders are common in primary care practice and incorporating sleep tracker data may help in improving patient care. We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a sleep program using the Fitbit Charge 2 (TM) device and SleepLife(R) application. The main aim of the study was to examine whether a program using a commercially available wearable sleep tracker device providing objective sleep data would improve communication in primary care settings between patients and their providers. Secondary aims included whether patient satisfaction with care would improve as result of the program. Methods A prospective, randomized, parallel group, observational pilot study was conducted in 20 primary care clinics in Indianapolis, IN from June 2018 to February 2019. Inclusion criteria included patients over the age of 18, have a diagnosis of insomnia identified by electronic medical record and/or a validated questionnaire, and were on a prescription sleep aid. The study was not specific to any sleep aid prescription, branded or generic, and was not designed to evaluate a drug or drug class. Each primary care clinic was randomized to either the SleepLife(R) intervention or the control arm. All patients were provided with a Fitbit Charge 2 (TM) device. Only patients in the intervention arm were educated on how to use the SleepLife(R) application. Physicians in the intervention arm were set up with the SleepLife (R) portal on their computers. Results Forty-nine physicians and 75 patients were enrolled in the study. Patients had a mean age of 57 (SD 12.8) years and 61% were female. Mean age of physicians was 47 (SD 10.6) years. Patients showed high rates of involvement in the program with 83% completing all survey questions. Physician survey completion rate was 55%. Only one physician logged into the SleepLife portal to check their patients' sleep status. At the end of the 6-week intervention, patients' composite general satisfaction scores with sleep health management decreased significantly in the intervention arm when compared to controls (p = 0.03). Patients' satisfaction with communication also decreased significantly in the intervention group (p = 0.01). The sleep outcomes, which were calculated on the basis of study questionnaire answers, improved significantly in the intervention group as compared to the control group (p = 0.04). Physician communication satisfaction scores remained unchanged (p = 0.12). Conclusions SleepLife(R) and its related physician portal can facilitate physician-patient communication, and it captures patient sleep outcomes including behaviors and habits. Patients were highly engaged with the program, while physicians did not demonstrate engagement. The study design and questionnaires do not specifically address the reasons behind the decreased patient satisfaction with care and communication, but it was perceived to be a result of physician non-responsiveness. Sleep quality scores on the other hand showed an improvement among SleepLife(R) users, suggesting that patients may have implemented good sleep practices on their own. Given that it was a feasibility study, and the sample size was small, we were not able to make major inferences regarding the difference between sleep disorder types. Additionally, we excluded patients with a history of alcohol use, substance abuse, or depression because of concerns that they may affect sleep independently. To promote the growth of technology in primary care, further research incorporating results from this study and physician engagement techniques should be included.",10.1007/s12325-021-02013-0,"pubmed, wos",Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Sleep; Tracker; Primary care; Technology; Communication; Smartphone app,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12325-021-02013-0)
A Fully Automated Self-help Biopsychosocial Transdiagnostic Digital Intervention to Reduce Anxiety and/or Depression and Improve Emotional Regulation and Well-being: Pre-Follow-up Single-Arm Feasibility Trial,Not Multi User,"Klein, B; Nguyen, H; McLaren, S; Andrews, B; Shandley, K",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Anxiety disorders and depression are prevalent disorders with high comorbidity, leading to greater chronicity and severity of symptoms. Given the accessibility to treatment issues, more evaluation is needed to assess the potential benefits of fully automated self-help transdiagnostic digital interventions. Innovating beyond the current transdiagnostic one-size-fits-all shared mechanistic approach may also lead to further improvements.Objective: The primary objective of this study was to explore the preliminary effectiveness and acceptability of a new fully automated self-help biopsychosocial transdiagnostic digital intervention (Life Flex) aimed at treating anxiety and/or depression, as well as improving emotional regulation; emotional, social, and psychological well-being; optimism; and health-related quality of life.Methods: This was a real-world pre-during-post-follow-up feasibility trial design evaluation of Life Flex. Participants were assessed at the preintervention time point (week 0), during intervention (weeks 3 and 5), at the postintervention time point (week 8), and at 1-and 3-month follow-ups (weeks 12 and 20, respectively).Results: The results provided early support for the Life Flex program in reducing anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9), psychological distress (Kessler 6), and emotional dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotional Regulation 36) and increasing emotional, social, and psychological well-being (Mental Health Continuum-Short Form); optimism (Revised Life Orientation Test); and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3L Utility Index and Health Rating; all false discovery rate [FDR]<.001). Large within-group treatment effect sizes (range |d|=0.82 to 1.33) were found for most variables from pre-to postintervention assessments and at the 1-and 3-month follow-up. The exceptions were medium treatment effect sizes for EQ-5D-3L Utility Index (range Cohen d=-0.50 to -0.63) and optimism (range Cohen d=-0.72 to -0.79) and small-to-medium treatment effect size change for EQ-5D-3L Health Rating (range Cohen d=-0.34 to -0.58). Changes across all outcome variables were generally strongest for participants with preintervention clinical comorbid anxiety and depression presentations (range |d|=0.58 to 2.01) and weakest for participants presenting with nonclinical anxiety and/or depressive symptoms (|d|=0.05 to 0.84). Life Flex was rated as acceptable at the postintervention time point, and participants indicated that they enjoyed the transdiagnostic program and biological, wellness, and lifestyle-focused content and strategies.Conclusions: Given the paucity of evidence on fully automated self-help transdiagnostic digital interventions for anxiety and/or depressive symptomatology and general treatment accessibility issues, this study provides preliminary support for biopsychosocial transdiagnostic interventions, such as Life Flex, as a promising future mental health service delivery gap filler. Following large-scale, randomized controlled trials, the potential benefits of fully automated self-help digital health programs, such as Life Flex, could be considerable.Trial Registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12615000480583; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=368007(JMIR Form Res 2023;7:e43385) doi: 10.2196/43385",10.2196/43385,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,anxiety; depression; fully automated; self-help; digital intervention; transdiagnostic; biopsychosocial; emotion regulation; allostatic load; brain plasticity; positive affect; comorbidity,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/43385)
"A Group-Facilitated, Internet-Based Intervention to Promote Mental Health and Well-Being in a Vulnerable Population of University Students: Randomized Controlled Trial of the Be Well Plan Program",Good,"Fassnacht, DB; Ali, K; van Agteren, J; Iasiello, M; Mavrangelos, T; Furber, G; Kyrios, M",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2022,"Background: A growing literature supports the use of internet-based interventions to improve mental health outcomes. However, most programs target specific symptoms or participant groups and are not tailored to facilitate improvements in mental health and well-being or do not allow for needs and preferences of individual participants. The Be Well Plan, a 5-week group-facilitated, internet-based mental health and well-being group intervention addresses these gaps, allowing participants to select a range of activities that they can tailor to their specific characteristics, needs, and preferences. Objective: This study aims to test whether the Be Well Plan program was effective in improving primary outcomes of mental well-being, resilience, anxiety, and depression compared to a waitlist control group during the COVID-19 pandemic; secondary outcomes included self-efficacy, a sense of control, and cognitive flexibility. The study further seeks to examine participants' engagement and satisfaction with the program. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 2 parallel arms, an intervention and a waitlist control group. The intervention involved 5 weekly 2-hour sessions, which were facilitated in group format using Zoom videoconferencing software. University students were recruited via social media posts, lectures, emails, flyers, and posters. Results: Using an intentional randomization 2:1 allocation strategy, we recruited 215 participants to the trial (n=126, 58.6%, intervention group; n=89, 41.4%, waitlist control group). Of the 126 participants assigned to the intervention group, 75 (59.5%) commenced the program and were included in modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analyses. mITT intervention participants attended, on average, 3.41 sessions (SD 1.56, median 4); 55 (73.3%) attended at least 4 sessions, and 25 (33.3%) attended all 5 sessions. Of the 49 intervention group participants who completed the postintervention assessment, 47 (95.9%) were either very satisfied (n=31, 66%) or satisfied (n=16, 34%). The mITT analysis for well-being (F-1,F-162 =9.65, P=.002, Cohen d=0.48) and resilience (F-1,F-162 =7.85, P=.006, Cohen d=0.44) showed significant time x group interaction effects, suggesting that both groups improved over time, but the Be Well Plan (intervention) group showed significantly greater improvement compared to the waitlist control group. A similar pattern of results was observed for depression and anxiety (Cohen d=0.32 and 0.37, respectively), as well as the secondary outcomes (self-efficacy, Cohen d=0.50; sense of control, Cohen d=0.42; cognitive flexibility, Cohen d=0.65). Larger effect sizes were observed in the completer analyses. Reliable change analysis showed that the majority of mITT participants (58/75, 77.3%) demonstrated a significant reliable improvement in at least 1 of the primary outcomes. Conclusions: The Be Well Plan program was effective in improving mental health and well-being, including mental well-being, resilience, depression, and anxiety.

A Live Video Dyadic Resiliency Intervention to Prevent Chronic Emotional Distress Early After Dementia Diagnoses: Protocol for a Dyadic Mixed Methods Study,Good,"Bannon, S; Brewer, J; Ahmad, N; Cornelius, T; Jackson, J; Parker, RA; Dams-O'Connor, K; Dickerson, BC; Ritchie, C; Vranceanu, AM",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2023,"Background: By 2030, approximately 75 million adults will be living with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs). ADRDs produce cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes for persons living with dementia that undermine independence and produce considerable stressors for persons living with dementia and their spousal care-partners-together called a dyad. Clinically elevated emotional distress (ie, depression and anxiety symptoms) is common for both dyad members after ADRD diagnosis, which can become chronic and negatively impact relationship functioning, health, quality of life, and collaborative management of progressive symptoms.Objective: This study is part of a larger study that aims to develop, adapt, and establish the feasibility of Resilient Together for Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (RT-ADRD), a novel dyadic skills-based intervention aimed at preventing chronic emotional distress. This study aims to gather comprehensive information to develop the first iteration of RT-ADRD and inform a subsequent open pilot. Here, we describe the proposed study design and procedures. Methods: All procedures will be conducted virtually (via phone and Zoom) to minimize participant burden and gather information regarding feasibility and best practices surrounding virtual procedures for older adults. We will recruit dyads (up to n=20) from Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) clinics within 1 month of ADRD diagnosis. Dyads will be self-referred or referred by their treating neurologists and complete screening to assess emotional distress and capacity to consent to participate in the study. Consenting dyads will then participate in a 60-minute qualitative interview using an interview guide designed to assess common challenges, unmet needs, and support preferences and to gather feedback on the proposed RT-ADRD intervention content and design. Each dyad member will then have the opportunity to participate in an optional individual interview to gather additional feedback. Finally, each dyad member will complete a brief quantitative survey remotely (by phone, tablet, or computer) via a secure platform to assess feasibility of assessment and gather preliminary data to explore associations between proposed mechanisms of change and secondary outcomes. We will conduct preliminary explorations of feasibility markers, including recruitment, screening, live video interviews, quantitative data collection, and mixed methods analyses.Results: This study has been approved by the MSH Institutional Review Board. We anticipate that the study will be completed by late 2023.Conclusions: We will use results from this study to develop the first live video telehealth dyadic resiliency intervention focused on the prevention of chronic emotional distress in couples shortly after ADRD diagnoses. Our study will allow us to gather comprehensive information from dyads on important factors to address in an early prevention-focused intervention and to explore feasibility of study procedures to inform future open pilot and pilot feasibility randomized control trial investigations of RT-ADRD.International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/45532",10.2196/45532,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",dyad; dementia; emotional distress; intervention; diagnosis; telehealth,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/45532)
A Longitudinal Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms and Pain Catastrophizing After Injury,Not Multi User,"Pacella-LaBarbara, ML; Plaitano, EG; Suffoletto, BP; Kuhn, E; Germain, A; Jaramillo, S; Repine, M; Callaway, CW",REHABILITATION PSYCHOLOGY,2023,"Purpose/Objective: Identifying individuals with high levels of pain catastrophizing (PC) may inform early psychological interventions to prevent the transition from acute to chronic post-injury pain. We examined whether pre-and post-injury posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) predict post-injury PC among emergency department (ED) patients following acute motor vehicle crash (MVC). Research Method/Design: This study represents secondary data analysis of a randomized clinical trial (NCT03247179) examining the efficacy of the PTSD Coach app on post-injury PTSS (PTSSpost). Among 63 injured ED patients (63% female; 57% non-White; average age = 37) with moderate pain (>= 4 of 10), we assessed recall of pre-injury PTSS (PTSSrecall: stemming from preexisting exposures) and baseline PC within 24 hr post-MVC; PTSSpost stemming from the MVC was assessed 30-days later, and the outcome of PC was assessed at 90-days post-injury. We controlled for group assignment (intervention vs. control) in all analyses. Results: Results revealed that at baseline and 90-days, PC was higher among non-White versus White participants. After adjusting for relevant covariates, PTSSrecall uniquely predicted post-injury PC and each subscale of PC (helplessness, magnification, and rumination). Similarly, after controlling for PTSSrecall and relevant covariates, PTSSpost uniquely predicted total and subscale post-injury PC. Intervention group participants reported less rumination than control group participants. Conclusions/Implications: These novel findings highlight that injured Black patients may be vulnerable to post-injury PC, and that both PTSSrecall and PTSSpost significantly predict post-injury PC.

A Low-cost Feasibility Training Study for DCD Children's Perceptual-motor Therapy,Not Multi User,"Basdekidou, C; Styliadis, A; Argyriadis, A; Dimen, L",BALTIC JOURNAL OF MODERN COMPUTING,2023,"The motor coordination problem of children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) has been frequently associated with poor visual and spatial eye-vision cognition. Virtual reality (VR) and immersive environments in occupational therapy and rehabilitation fields are major changes nowadays and VR has been shown to encourage more repetition allowing for faster motor skill development and recovery. In addition, spatial cognition has attracted the attention of the scientific community recently in mental rotation, DCD orientation, spatial navigation, and cognitive mapping. This feasibility study demonstrated the usability of an immersive VR environment as a spatial cognition recording tool for children with motor skill disorders. Eighty children aged five to eight years; five intervention groups; four virtual 3D environments with flora (trees, plants) and linearity (spatial linear structure geometries as landmark coordination cues) as design parameters; and trial walk-through exercises on a predefined trial visual pathway and on the same motor coordination control situations (darkness, no time -pressing). Participants' time performance and walk-through satisfaction were recorded and analyzed statistically. Walking physiology was shown to be more stable and robust (in path completion rates, time performance, and walk-through level of satisfaction) in virtual 3D environments rich in flora and linearity. The VR training functionality and the immersive learning performance enjoyed a 19% reduction in time performance and 102% more walk-through satisfaction, and their effectiveness and robustness were validated statistically. Children with motor skill difficulties train and learn better in virtual 3D environments rich in flora and linearity. Hence, immersive walk-through trials in digital environments rich in flora and linearity, as training interventions, could be regarded as a perceptual-motor therapy (PMT) as they seemed beneficial in improving DCD children's motor function.",10.22364/bjmc.2023.11.4.10,wos,Computer Science,VR training and learning; spatial cognition; landmark coordination cues; environmental geometry; walk-through satisfaction; reality modeling; Developmental coordination disorder; motor skill disorder; perceptual-motor therapy; motor imagery,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.22364/bjmc.2023.11.4.10)
A Mobile App for Stress Management in Middle-Aged Men and Women (Calm): Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Laird, B; Puzia, M; Larkey, L; Ehlers, D; Huberty, J",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Middle-aged adults (40-65 years) report higher stress levels than most other age groups. There is a need to determine the feasibility of using a meditation app to reduce stress and improve stress-related outcomes in middle-aged adults with a focus on men, as previous meditation app-based studies have reported a low proportion of or even no male participants. Objective: This study aims to (1) determine the feasibility (ie, acceptability and demand with a focus on men) of a consumer-based meditation app (Calm), to reduce stress among middle-aged adults reporting elevated stress levels, and (2) explore the preliminary effects of Calm on perceived stress, psychological outcomes (anxiety, depressive symptoms, mindfulness, and general coping), health behaviors (physical activity and eating habits), and COVID-19 perceptions. Methods: This feasibility randomized controlled trial evaluated an app-based meditation intervention in middle-aged adults (N=83) with elevated stress levels (ie, Perceived Stress Scale score >= 15) and limited or no previous experience with meditation. Participants were randomized to the intervention group (Calm app) or a control (educational podcasts; POD) group. Participants completed self-report assessments at baseline and postintervention (week 4). Feasibility was measured as acceptability and demand using Bowen framework. Feasibility and COVID-19 perceptions data were examined using descriptive statistics, and preliminary effects were evaluated using repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Participants were satisfied with Calm (27/28, 96%) and found it appropriate or useful (26/28, 93%). Most reported they would likely continue using the Calm app (18/28, 64%). More Calm users reported satisfaction, appropriateness or usefulness, and intent to continue app use than POD users. Calm users (n=33) completed a mean of 20 (SD 31.1) minutes of meditation on the days they meditated and 103 (SD 109.1) minutes of meditation per week. The average adherence rate to the prescribed meditation was 71% among Calm app users, compared to 62% among POD users. Recruitment rate of men was 35% (29/83). Of those randomized to Calm, 55% (15/29) were men, and retention among them was higher (14/15, 93%) than that among women (12/20, 60%). No significant within or between group differences were observed. Conclusions: A 4-week, app-based mindfulness meditation intervention (Calm) may be feasible for middle-aged adults and a useful stress-management tool. Calm users expressed satisfaction with the app and felt it was appropriate and useful. Significant improvements in perceived stress and psychological outcomes or stress-related health behaviors were not observed. Even though men spent less time in meditation than women did and completed fewer weekly sessions, they were more likely to adhere to the prescription.

A Mobile App for Thyroid Cancer Patients Aiming to Enhance Their Quality of Life: Protocol for a Quasiexperimental Interventional Pilot Study,Not Multi User,"Giannoula, E; Iakovou, I; Katsikavelas, I; Antoniou, P; Raftopoulos, V; Chatzipavlidou, V; Papadopoulos, N; Bamidis, P",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2020,"Background: Thyroid cancer (TC) is one of the fastest growing cancers all over the world. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most frequent subtype of TC. When appropriate treatment is given, the prognosis for the patient is generally excellent. Despite the generally good prognosis of thyroid carcinomas, the symptoms may range from emotional to physical discomfort, depending on the thyroid hormone status, which can severely affect the patient. Moreover, the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that DTC patients have to undergo, such as thyroidectomy and radioiodine therapy, significantly affect their mental and physical well-being. Often, the physician only addresses the favorable prognosis of DTC compared with other cancer types and neglects to assess issues related to the quality of life (QoL) of the patient; this was the reason we decided to design a mobile app for DTC patients and their caregivers. Objective: The aim of this study is to research the feasibility and applicability of an mHealth app tailored to DTC patients, as reflected in their QoL. The main features of the developed app offer access to useful information about thyroid cancer, diagnostic tests, and the appropriate therapy administered to DTC patients. Methods: Based on the existing literature, we created an up-to-date information platform regarding TC and especially DTC. In order to develop an effective app that can be implemented in current health care, we designed a section where the patient and physician can keep a medical record in an effort to enable access to such information at any time. Finally, we designed a user-friendly notification program, including pill prescription, follow-up tests, and doctor visit reminders in order to equally facilitate the lives of the patient and physician. Results: Having developed this mobile app, we aim to conduct a pilot quasiexperimental interventional trial. Our intention is to enroll at least 30 TC patients and assign them to intervention or control groups. Both groups will receive standard care for treating and monitoring TC, and the intervention group will also receive and use the DTC app. TC patients' QoL will be assessed for both control and intervention groups in order to examine the effectiveness of the DTC app. QoL will be assessed through the QoL core questionnaire European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-THY34 in combination with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire through quantitative statistical analysis. Conclusions: The use of mHealth apps can play a significant role in patient education, disease self-management, remote monitoring of patients, and QoL improvement. However, the main limitation of the majority of existing studies has been the lack of assessing their usefulness as well as the absence of specific instruments to carry out this assessment. In light of those considerations, we developed a mobile app tailored to the needs of DTC patients. Furthermore, we evaluated its contribution to the QoL of the patients by using the EORTC QLQ-THY34 questionnaire, an accurate and safe instrument for the evaluation of the QoL in TC patients, while supporting future planned endeavors in the field.",10.2196/13409,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",mhealth; thyroid cancer; application; quality of life; patient-centered medicine; patient education,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/13409)

However, most clinically tested intervention programs for nonprofessional caregivers require face-to-face training, and many caregivers encounter obstacles that hinder their participation in such programs. Consequently, it is necessary to design internet-based intervention programs for nonprofessional caregivers that address their needs and test the efficacy of the programs. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone app-based intervention program to increase positive mental health for nonprofessional caregivers. Methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial of 3 months' duration. A total of 152 caregivers over 18 years of age with a minimum of 4 months' experience as nonprofessional caregivers were recruited from primary health care institutions. Nonprofessional caregivers were randomized into two groups. In the intervention group, each caregiver installed a smartphone app and used it for 28 days. This app offered them daily activities that were based on 10 recommendations to promote positive mental health. The level of positive mental health, measured using the Positive Mental Health Questionnaire (PMHQ), and caregiver burden, measured using the 7-item short-form version of the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI-7), were the primary outcomes. Users' satisfaction was also measured. Results: In all, 113 caregivers completed the study. After the first month of the intervention, only one factor of the PMHQ, F1-Personal satisfaction, showed a significant difference between the groups, but it was not clinically relevant (0.96; P=.03). However, the intervention group obtained a higher mean change for the overall PMHQ score (mean change between groups: 1.40; P=.24). The results after the third month of the intervention showed an increment of PMHQ scores. The mean difference of change in the PMHQ score showed a significant difference between the groups (11.43; P<.001; d=0.82). Significant changes were reported in 5 of the 6 factors, especially F5-Problem solving and self-actualization (5.69; P<.001; d=0.71), F2-Prosocial attitude (2.47; P<.001; d=1.18), and F3-Self-control (0.76; P=.03; d=0.50). The results of the ZBI-7 showed a decrease in caregiver burden in the intervention group, although the results were inconclusive. Approximately 93.9% (46/49) of the app users indicated that they would recommend the app to other caregivers and 56.3% (27/49) agreed that an extension of the program's duration would be beneficial. Conclusions: The app-based intervention program analyzed in this study was effective in promoting positive mental health and decreasing the burden of caregivers and achieved a high range of user satisfaction. This study provides evidence that mobile phone app-based intervention programs may be useful tools for increasing nonprofessional caregivers' well-being. The assessment of the effectiveness of intervention programs through clinical trials should be a focus to promote internet-based programs in health policies.",10.2196/21708,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,clinical trial; caregiver; mobile phone app; intervention program; positive mental health; mobile health; health promotion; randomized controlled trial; nursing; caregiving; technology,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/21708)
A Mobile Application Adjunct to Augment Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy for Adolescents with Social Anxiety: Feasibility and Acceptability Results from the Wiring Adolescents with Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions Pilot Trial,Other,"Biagianti, B; Conelea, C; Dabit, S; Ross, D; Beard, KL; Harris, E; Shen, ER; Jordan, J; Bernstein, GA",JOURNAL OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,2023,"Objective: Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy (CBGT) is an established treatment for Social Anxiety (SA). However, diagnostic recovery rate is only 20.5% in CBGT, and up to 50% of patients remain symptomatic posttreatment. Using videocalls to deliver digital CBGT (dCBGT) is feasible, cost-effective, and efficacious. Yet, the impact of dCBGT on social functioning remains limited, as dCBGT does not offer opportunities for monitoring cognition and behavior in social situations. Wiring Adolescents with Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions (WASABI), a clinician-assisted application that uses ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), cognitive bias tests, and clinical self-reports, was investigated as an adjunct to dCBGT.Methods: A prospective, parallel arm, double-blind randomized controlled trial was employed in 24 SA adolescents randomly assigned to dCBGT versus dCBGT plus WASABI.Results: Study completion rates (83%) and exit survey data indicated that WASABI is feasible and acceptable. Engagement with EMAs varied from four to 244 EMAs completed per person. Cognitive bias tests and clinical self-reports were completed at least weekly by 53% and 69% of participants, respectively. While standard tests did not reveal statistically significant differences between dCBGT plus WASABI and dCBGT alone, effect sizes were greater for dCBGT plus WASABI on symptom severity, social skills, and functioning.Conclusions: Despite the small sample, preliminary results suggest that WASABI is feasible, acceptable, and may be an effective augmentation tool for treating SA in teenagers.",10.1089/cap.2023.0001,"pubmed, wos",Pediatrics; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,social anxiety; digital health; ecological momentary assessments; group CBT,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1089/cap.2023.0001)
A Mobile Education and Social Support Group Intervention for Improving Postpartum Health in Northern India: Development and Usability Study,Good,"El Ayadi, AM; Duggal, M; Bagga, R; Singh, P; Kumar, V; Ahuja, A; Kankaria, A; Basavarajappa, DH; Kaur, J; Sharma, P; Gupta, S; Pendse, RS; Weil, L; Swendeman, D; Diamond-Smith, NG",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Structural and cultural barriers limit Indian women's access to adequate postnatal care and support despite their importance for maternal and neonatal health. Targeted postnatal education and support through a mobile health intervention may improve postnatal recovery, neonatal care practices, nutritional status, knowledge and care seeking, and mental health. Objective: We sought to understand the feasibility and acceptability of our first pilot phase, a flexible 6-week postnatal mobile health intervention delivered to 3 groups of women in Punjab, India, and adapt our intervention for our next pilot phase, which will formally assess intervention feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Methods: Our intervention prototype was designed to deliver culturally tailored educational programming via a provider-moderated, voice- and text-based group approach to connect new mothers with a social support group of other new mothers, increase their health-related communication with providers, and refer them to care needed. We targeted deployment using feature phones to include participants from diverse socioeconomic groups. We held moderated group calls weekly, disseminated educational audios, and created SMS text messaging groups. We varied content delivery, group discussion participation, and chat moderation. Three groups of postpartum women from Punjab were recruited for the pilot through community health workers. Sociodemographic data were collected at baseline. Intervention feasibility and acceptability were assessed through weekly participant check-ins (N=29), weekly moderator reports, structured end-line in-depth interviews among a subgroup of participants (15/29, 52%), and back-end technology data. Results: The participants were aged 24 to 28 years and 1 to 3 months postpartum. Of the 29 participants, 17 (59%) had their own phones. Half of the participants (14/29, 48%) attended >= 3 of the 6 calls; the main barriers were childcare and household responsibilities and network or phone issues. Most participants were very satisfied with the intervention (16/19, 84%) and found the educational content (20/20, 100%) and group discussions (17/20, 85%) very useful. The participants used the SMS text messaging chat, particularly when facilitator-moderated. Sustaining participation and fostering group interactions was limited by technological and sociocultural challenges. Conclusions: The intervention was considered generally feasible and acceptable, and protocol adjustments were identified to improve intervention delivery and engagement. To address technological issues, we engaged a cloud-based service provider for group calls and an interactive voice response service provider for educational recordings and developed a smartphone app for the participants. We seek to overcome sociocultural challenges through new strategies for increasing group engagement, including targeting midlevel female community health care providers as moderators. Our second pilot will assess intervention feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness at 6 months. Ultimately, we seek to support the health and well-being of postpartum women and their infants in South Asia and beyond through the development of efficient, acceptable, and effective intervention strategies.",10.2196/34087,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,mHealth; group care; postpartum; postnatal; antenatal; India; pilot; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/34087)
A Mobile Health App-Based Postnatal Educational Program (Home-but not Alone): Descriptive Qualitative Study,Good,"Shorey, S; Yang, YY; Dennis, CL",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2018,"Background: The postnatal period poses numerous challenges for new parents. Various educational programs are available to support new parents during this stressful period. However, the usefulness of educational programs must be evaluated to ascertain their credibility. Objective: The aim of this descriptive, qualitative study was to explore the views of parents of newborns with regard to the content and delivery of a mobile health (mHealth) app-based postnatal educational program. Methods: A qualitative semistructured interview guide was used to collect data from 17 participants who belonged to the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial. The intervention, a 4-week-long access to a mHealth app-based educational program, was evaluated. The interviews were conducted in English and at the participants' homes. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist was used to report the findings. Results: The interviews revealed 4 main themes: (1) positive features of the mHealth app, (2) advice from midwives, (3) experiences gained from using the mHealth app, and (4) recommendations for the future. The participants evaluated the educational program to be a good source of information that was tailored to the local context. The different modes of delivery, including audio and video, accentuated the accessibility of information. The parents evaluated that the facilitator of the featured communication platform, a midwife, provided trustworthy advice. Belongingness to a virtual community beyond the hospital endowed the parents the confidence that they were not alone and were supported by other parents and health care professionals. Conclusions: According to the parents, the mHealth app-based educational program was helpful in supporting a multi-ethnic sample of parents during the postnatal period. This insight indicates that the program could be implemented in a wide community of parents in the postnatal period. The helpfulness of the educational program is a testament of the potential benefits of using telemedicine among new parents postnatally. Resources can also be dedicated toward extending the duration of access to the app beyond 1 month and developing relevant content for parents across the perinatal period.",10.2196/jmir.9188,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,parents; postnatal care; mobile applications; midwifery; nurse midwives; nursing,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.9188)
A Mobile Health Intervention for Mental Health Promotion Among University Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Bendtsen, M; Müssener, U; Linderoth, C; Thomas, K",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2020,"Background: High positive mental health, including the ability to cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively, and be able to contribute to one's community, has been associated with various health outcomes. The role of positive mental health is therefore increasingly recognized in national mental health promotion programs and policies. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions could be a cost-effective way to disseminate positive psychological interventions to the general population. Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of a fully automated mHealth intervention on positive mental health, and anxiety and depression symptomology among Swedish university students using a randomized controlled trial design. Methods: A 2-arm, single-blind (researchers), parallel-groups randomized controlled trial with an mHealth positive psychology program intervention group and a relevant online mental health information control group was employed to estimate the effect of the novel intervention. Participants were recruited using digital advertising through student health care centers in Sweden. Inclusion criteria were (1) university students, (2) able to read and understand Swedish, (3) and have access to a mobile phone. Exclusion criteria were high positive mental health, as assessed by the Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF), or high depression and anxiety symptomology, as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). The primary outcome was positive mental health (MHC-SF), and the secondary outcomes were depression and anxiety symptomatology (HADS). The subscales of MHC-SF were also analyzed as exploratory outcomes. Outcomes were measured 3 months after randomization through questionnaires completed on the participants' mobile phones. Results: A total of 654 participants (median age 25 years), including 510 (78.0%) identifying as female, were randomized to either the intervention (n=348) or control group (n=306). At follow-up, positive mental health was significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the control group (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=1.067, 95% CI 1.024-1.112, P=.002). For both depression and anxiety symptomatology, the intervention group showed significantly lower scores at follow-up compared with the control group (depression: IRR=0.820, 95% CI 0.714-0.942, P=.005; anxiety: IRR=0.899, 95% CI 0.840-0.962, P=.002). Follow-up rates were lower than expected (58.3% for primary outcomes and 52.3% for secondary outcomes); however, attrition analyses did not identify any systematic attrition with respect to baseline variables. Conclusions: The mHealth intervention was estimated to be superior to usual care in increasing positive mental health among university students. A protective effect of the intervention was also found on depressive and anxiety symptoms. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using an automated mobile phone format to enhance positive mental health, which offers promise for the use of mHealth solutions in public mental health promotion.",10.2196/17208,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,mHealth; positive mental health; university students; randomized controlled trial,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/17208)
"A Mobile Health Intervention for Self-Management and Lifestyle Change for Persons With Type 2 Diabetes, Part 2: One-Year Results From the Norwegian Randomized Controlled Trial RENEWING HEALTH",Not mental health,"Holmen, H; Torbjornsen, A; Wahl, AK; Jenum, AK; Småstuen, MC; Årsand, E; Ribu, L",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2014,"Background: Self-management is crucial in the daily management of type 2 diabetes. It has been suggested that mHealth may be an important method for enhancing self-management when delivered in combination with health counseling. Objective: The objective of this study was to test whether the use of a mobile phone-based self-management system used for 1 year, with or without telephone health counseling by a diabetes specialist nurse for the first 4 months, could improve glycated hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) level, self-management, and health-related quality of life compared with usual care. Methods: We conducted a 3-arm prospective randomized controlled trial involving 2 intervention groups and 1 control group. Eligible participants were persons with type 2 diabetes with an HbA1c level >= 7.1% (>= 54.1 mmol/mol) and aged >= 18 years. Both intervention groups received the mobile phone-based self-management system Few Touch Application (FTA). The FTA consisted of a blood glucose-measuring system with automatic wireless data transfer, diet manual, physical activity registration, and management of personal goals, all recorded and operated using a diabetes diary app on the mobile phone. In addition, one intervention group received health counseling based on behavior change theory and delivered by a diabetes specialist nurse for the first 4 months after randomization. All groups received usual care by their general practitioner. The primary outcome was HbA1c level. Secondary outcomes were self-management (heiQ), health-related quality of life (SF-36), depressive symptoms (CES-D), and lifestyle changes (dietary habits and physical activity). Data were analyzed using univariate methods (t test, ANOVA) and multivariate linear and logistic regression. Results: A total of 151 participants were randomized: 51 to the FTA group, 50 to the FTA-health counseling (FTA-HC) group, and 50 to the control group. Follow-up data after 1 year were available for 120 participants (79%). HbA(1c) level decreased in all groups, but did not differ between groups after 1 year. The mean change in the heiQ domain skills and technique acquisition was significantly greater in the FTA-HC group after adjusting for age, gender, and education (P=.04). Other secondary outcomes did not differ between groups after 1 year. In the FTA group, 39% were substantial users of the app; 34% of the FTA-HC group were substantial users. Those aged >= 63 years used the app more than their younger counterparts did ( OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.02-7.12; P=.045). Conclusions: The change in HbA(1c) level did not differ between groups after the 1-year intervention. Secondary outcomes did not differ between groups except for an increase in the self-management domain of skill and technique acquisition in the FTA-HC group. Older participants used the app more than the younger participants did.",10.2196/mhealth.3882,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,self-care; mobile applications; cellular phone; telemedicine; counseling; motivational interviewing; diabetes mellitus; type 2; hemoglobin A1c protein; human,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/mhealth.3882)

Asian women experience a disproportionate risk of both GDM and T2D compared to women from other ethnic backgrounds. Lifestyle interventions and behavior change can delay or even prevent the onset of T2D. We have developed a digitalized diabetes prevention intervention for the prevention of T2D in Malaysian women with GDM. Objective: The protocol describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the feasibility of undertaking a definitive trial of a diabetes prevention intervention, including a smartphone app and group support. Secondary aims are to summarize anthropometric, biomedical, psychological, and lifestyle outcomes overall and by allocation group, and to undertake a process evaluation. Methods: This is a two-arm parallel feasibility RCT. A total of 60 Malaysian women with GDM will be randomized in the antenatal period to receive the intervention or standard care until 12 months post partum. The intervention is a diabetes prevention intervention delivered via a smartphone app developed based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model of behavior change and group support using motivational interviewing. The intervention provides women with tailored information and support to encourage weight loss through adapted dietary intake and physical activity. Women in the control arm will receive standard care. The Malaysian Ministry of Health's Medical Research and Ethics Committee has approved the trial (NMRR-21-1667-60212). Results: Recruitment and enrollment began in February 2022. Future outcomes will be published in peer-reviewed health-related research journals and presented at national, regional, or state professional meetings and conferences.

Mental mobile Health (mHealth) interventions are now being widely deployed due to their attractive implementation features, despite the lack of evidence about their efficacy in this specific population and context. Objective: The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychoeducational, mindfulness-based mHealth intervention to reduce mental health problems in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a blinded, parallel-group, controlled trial in Spain. Health care workers providing face-to-face health care to patients with COVID-19 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (an app targeting emotional skills, healthy lifestyle behavior, burnout, and social support) or a control app (general recommendations about mental health care) for 2 weeks. The participants were blinded to their group allocation. Data were collected telephonically at baseline and after 2 weeks by trained health psychologists. The primary outcome was a composite of depression, anxiety, and stress (overall score on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 [DASS-21]). Secondary outcomes were insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey), posttraumatic stress (Davidson Trauma Scale), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale), and DASS-21 individual scale scores. Differences between groups were analyzed using general linear modeling according to an intention-to-treat protocol. Additionally, we measured the usability of the PsyCovidApp (System Usability Scale). The outcome data collectors and trial statisticians were unaware of the treatment allocation. Results: Between May 14 and July 25, 2020, 482 health care workers were recruited and randomly assigned to PsyCovidApp (n=248) or the control app (n=234). At 2 weeks, complete outcome data were available for 436/482 participants (90.5%). No significant differences were observed between the groups at 2 weeks in the primary outcome (standardized mean difference -0.04; 95% CI -0.11 to 0.04; P=.15) or in the other outcomes. In our prespecified subgroup analyses, we observed significant improvements among health care workers consuming psychotropic medications (n=79) in the primary outcome (-0.29; 95% CI -0.48 to -0.09; P=.004), and in posttraumatic stress, insomnia, anxiety, and stress. Similarly, among health care workers receiving psychotherapy (n=43), we observed improvements in the primary outcome (-0.25; 95% CI -0.49 to -0.02; P=.02), and in insomnia, anxiety, and stress. The mean usability score of PsyCovidApp was high (87.21/100, SD 12.65). After the trial, 208/221 participants in the intervention group (94.1%) asked to regain access to PsyCovidApp, indicating high acceptability. Conclusions: In health care workers assisting patients with COVID-19 in Spain, PsyCovidApp, compared with a control app, reduced mental health problems at 2 weeks only among health care workers receiving psychotherapy or psychotropic medications.

Conventional treatment options, particularly psychotherapy, do not reach all students in need of help. Internet-and mobile-based interventions are promising alternatives for narrowing the treatment gap. Objective: In the framework of a randomized controlled trial, we aim to investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and side effects of a self-help smartphone app (MCT & More) based on cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy, and metacognitive training in a sample of students with self-reported depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we were interested in examining the influence of treatment expectations and attitudes toward internet-and mobile-based interventions on treatment adherence and effectiveness. Methods: A total of 400 students were recruited via open access websites and randomized to either the intervention group (n=200), who received access to the self-help smartphone app MCT & More for a period of 4 weeks, or to a wait-list control group (n=200). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression) served as the primary outcome parameter, and the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (self-esteem) and the global item of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-abbreviated version (quality of life) served as the secondary outcome parameters. The Attitudes Towards Psychological Online Interventions was used to measure attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions. Outcome expectations were assessed using the Patient Questionnaire on Therapy Expectation and Evaluation, and side effects were assessed using the Inventory for Assessing Negative Effects of Psychotherapy. Results: Per-protocol (PP), complete-case, and intention-to-treat analyses showed a significantly higher reduction in depressive symptoms (PP: F-1222=3.98; P=.047; d=0.26) and a significantly higher increase in self-esteem (PP: F-1220=8.79; P=.003; d=0.77) in the intervention group than in the wait-list control group. Most participants regularly used the self-help smartphone app (91/120, 75.8%, at least once a week). The more positive the attitude toward internet-and mobile-based interventions (r=0.260; P=.004) and the more positive the outcome expectation (r=0.236; P=.009), the more frequently the self-help smartphone app was used. Conclusions: The effectiveness of the self-help smartphone app MCT & More was demonstrated among students with depressive symptoms compared with a wait-list control group.

A Mobile-Based Mindfulness and Social Support Program for Adolescents and Young Adults With Sarcoma: Development and Pilot Testing,Good,"Donovan, E; Martin, SR; Seidman, LC; Zeltzer, LK; Cousineau, TM; Payne, LA; Trant, M; Weiman, M; Knoll, M; Federman, NC",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2019,"Background: Approximately 70,000 adolescents and young adults (AYA) are diagnosed with cancer each year in the United States. Sarcomas carry a particularly high symptom burden and are some of the most common cancers among AYA. Recent work has documented significant levels of unmet needs among AYA with cancer, particularly the need for psychosocial support. Mobile technology may be a cost-effective and efficient way to deliver a psychosocial intervention to AYA with cancer and cancer survivors. Objective: The two aims of this study were to (1) develop a pilot version of a mobile-based mindfulness and social support program and (2) evaluate program usage and acceptability. An exploratory aim was to examine change in psychosocial outcomes. Methods: Thirty-seven AYA with sarcoma or sarcoma survivors, parents, and health care providers participated in the study. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 AYA, parents of five of the adolescents, and six health care providers. Themes from the interviews helped to inform the development of a mobile-based mindfulness pilot program and a companion Facebook-based social support group. Twenty AYA consented to participate in a single-arm pre-post evaluation of the program; 17 downloaded the app and joined the Facebook group. Seven of these participants had participated in the semistructured interviews. Six additional health care providers consented to participate in the evaluation stage. Results: On average, participants completed 16.9 of the 28 unique sessions and used the mindfulness app for a mean 10.2 (SD 8.2) days during the 28-day evaluation period. The majority of participants (16/17) engaged in the social group and posted at least one reply to the moderator's prompts. The mean number of responses per person to the moderator of the social group was 15.2 of 31 (49%, range 0%-97%). Both AYA and health care providers responded positively to the Mindfulness for Resilience in Illness program and offered useful recommendations for improvements. Exploratory psychosocial analyses indicated there were no significant differences from pretest to posttest on measures of perceived social support, mindfulness, body image, or psychological functioning. Conclusions: This study offers preliminary support for the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile-based mindfulness and Facebook-based social support program for AYA with sarcoma.

The explanations were provided in a YouTube-like interview setting by a native Arabic-speaking physician. Elements of gamification (quizzes and rewards for solving the test items) were also used. Consecutive videos and quizzes were presented over an intervention period of 6 weeks, and the group intervention was scheduled as an add-on for half of the participants in week 6. The manual of the group intervention was designed to provide actual behavioral planning based on the health action process approach. Sociodemographic information, mental health status, knowledge about COVID-19, and available vaccines were assessed using questionnaire-based interviews at baseline and after 6 weeks. Interpreters assisted with the interviews in all cases.Results: Enrollment in the study proved to be very challenging. In addition, owing to tightened contact restrictions, face-to-face group interventions could not be conducted as planned. A total of 88 participants from 8 collective housing institutions were included in the study. A total of 65 participants completed the full-intake interview.

They also claimed to comply with preventive measures to a very high extent (eg, always wearing masks was indicated by 43/65, 66% of participants), but practicing behavior that was not considered as effective against COVID-19 transmission was also frequently reported as a preventive measure (eg, mouth rinsing). By contrast, factual knowledge of COVID-19 was limited. Preoccupation with the information materials presented in the app steeply declined after study enrollment (eg, 12/61, 20% of participants watched the videos scheduled for week 3). Of the 61 participants, only 18 (30%) participants could be reached for the follow-up interviews. Their COVID-19 knowledge did not increase after the intervention period (P=.56).Conclusions: The results indicated that vaccine uptake was high and seemed to depend on organizational determinants for the target group. The current mobile app-based intervention demonstrated low feasibility, which might have been related to various obstacles faced during the delivery. Therefore, in the case of future pandemics, transmission prevention in a specific target group should rely more on structural aspects rather than sophisticated psychological interventions.",10.2196/44551,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,prevention; COVID-19; refugees; asylum seekers; adolescents; feasibility; behavior planning; vaccination; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/44551)

A Neurofeedback-Based Intervention to Reduce Post-Operative Pain in Lung Cancer Patients: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Gorini, A; Marzorati, C; Casiraghi, M; Spaggiari, L; Pravettoni, G",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2015,"Background: Thoracic surgery appears to be the treatment of choice for many lung cancers. Nevertheless, depending on the type of surgery, the chest area may be painful for several weeks to months after surgery. This painful state has multiple physical and psychological implications, including respiratory failure, inability to clear secretions by coughing, and even anxiety and depression that have negative effects on recovery. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a neurofeedback-based intervention on controlling acute post-surgery pain and improving long-term recovery in patients who undergo thoracotomy for lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at an academic oncologic hospital. Methods: This study will be based on a 2-parallel group randomized controlled trial design, intervention versus usual care, with multiple in-hospital assessments and 2 clinical, radiological, and quality of life follow-ups. Participants will be randomized to either the intervention group receiving a neurofeedback-based relaxation training and usual care, or to a control group receiving only usual care. Pain intensity is the primary outcome and will be assessed using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS) in the days following the operation. Secondary outcomes will include the effect of the intervention on hospital utilization for pain crisis, daily opioid consumption, anxiety, patient engagement, blood test and chest x-ray results, and long-term clinical, radiological, and quality of life evaluations. Outcome measures will be repeatedly taken during hospitalization, while follow-up assessments will coincide with the follow-up visits. Pain intensity will be assessed by mixed model repeated analysis. Effect sizes will be calculated as mean group differences with standard deviations. Results: We expect to have results for this study before the end of 2016.

A New Mental Health Mobile App for Well-Being and Stress Reduction in Working Women: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Coelhoso, CC; Tobo, PR; Lacerda, SS; Lima, AH; Barrichello, CRC; Amaro, E ; Kozasa, EH",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: Although the availability and use of mobile mental health apps has grown exponentially in recent years, little data are available regarding their efficacy. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an app developed to promote stress management and well-being among working women compared with a control app. Methods: Female employees at a private hospital were invited to participate in the study via mailing lists and intranet ads. A total of 653 individuals self-enrolled through the website. Eligible participants were randomized between control (n=240) and intervention (n=250) groups. The well-being mobile app provides an 8-week program with 4 classes per week (including a brief theoretical portion and a 15-min guided practice). The active control app also provided 4 assessments per week that encouraged participants to self-observe how they were feeling for 20 min. We also used the app to conduct Web-based questionnaires (10-item Perceived Stress Scale and 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index) and ask specific questions to assess subjective levels of stress and well-being at baseline (t(1)), midintervention (t(4)=4 weeks after t(1)) and postintervention (t(8)=8 weeks after t(1)). Both apps were fully automated without any human involvement. Outcomes from the control and intervention conditions at the 3 time points were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Among the randomized participants (n=490), 185 participants were excluded at the 4-week follow-up and another 79 at the 8-week follow-up because of noncompliance with the experimental protocol. Participants who did not complete t(4) and t(8) assessments were equally distributed between groups (t(4): control group=34.6% [83/240] and intervention group=40.8% [102/250]; P=.16; t(8): control group=29.9% [47/157] and intervention group=21.6% [32/148]; P=.10).

A New Virtual-Reality Training Module for Laparoscopic Surgical Skills and Equipment Handling: Can Multitasking be Trained? A Randomized Controlled Trial,Not mental health,"Bongers, PJ; van Hove, PD; Stassen, LPS; Dankelman, J; Schreuder, HWR",JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION,2015,"OBJECTIVE: During laparoscopic surgery distractions often occur and multitasking between surgery and other tasks, such as technical equipment handling, is a necessary competence. In psychological research, reduction of adverse effects of distraction is demonstrated when specifically multitasking is trained. The aim of this study was to examine whether multitasking and more specifically taskswitching can be trained in a virtual-reality (VR) laparoscopic skills simulator. DESIGN: After randomization, the control group trained separately with an insufflator simulation module and a laparoscopic skills exercise module on a VR simulator. In the intervention group, insufflator module and VR skills exercises were combined to develop a new integrated training in which multitasking was a required competence. At random moments, problems with the insufflator appeared and forced the trainee to multitask. During several repetitions of a different multitask VR skills exercise as posttest, performance parameters (laparoscopy time, insufflator time, and errors) were measured and compared between both the groups as well with a pretest exercise to establish the learning effect. A face-validity questionnaire was filled afterward. SETTING: University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Medical and PhD students (n = 42) from University Medical Centre Utrecht, without previous experience in laparoscopic simulation, were randomly assigned to either intervention (n = 21) or control group (n = 21). RESULTS: All participants performed better in the posttest exercises without distraction of the insufflator compared with the exercises in which multitasking was necessary to solve the insufflator problems. After training, the intervention group was significantly quicker in solving the insufflator problems (mean = 1.60 Log(s) vs 1.70 Log(s), p = 0.02). No significant differences between both the groups were seen in laparoscopy time and errors. CONCLUSION: Multitasking has negative effects on the laparoscopic performance. This study suggests an additional learning effect of training multitasking in VR laparoscopy simulation, because the trainees are able to handle a secondary task (solving insufflator problems) quicker. These results may aid the development of laparoscopy VR training programs in approximating real-life laparoscopic surgery. (C) 2014 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

A Novel Artificial Intelligence-Powered Emotional Intelligence and Mindfulness App (Ajivar) for the College Student Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Quantitative Questionnaire Study,Not Multi User,"Sturgill, R; Martinasek, M; Schmidt, T; Goyal, R",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2021,"Background: Emotional intelligence (EI) and mindfulness can impact the level of anxiety and depression that an individual experiences. These symptoms have been exacerbated among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ajivar is an app that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to deliver personalized mindfulness and EI training. Objective: The main objective of this research study was to determine the effectiveness of delivering an EI curriculum and mindfulness techniques using an AI conversation platform, Ajivar, to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression during this pandemic. Methods: A total of 99 subjects, aged 18 to 29 years, were recruited from a second-semester group of freshmen students. All participants completed the online TestWell Wellness Inventory at the start and end of the 14-week semester. The comparison group members (49/99, 49%) were given routine mental wellness instruction. The intervention group members (50/99, 51%) were required to complete Ajivar activities in addition to routine mental wellness instruction during the semester, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This group also completed assessments to evaluate for anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and depression, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Results: Study participants reported a mean age of 19.9 (SD 1.94) years; 27% (27/99) of the group were male and 60% (59/99) identified as Caucasian. No significant demographic differences existed between the comparison and intervention groups. Subjects in the intervention group interacted with Ajivar for a mean time of 1424 (SD 1168) minutes. There was a significant decrease in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7: the mean score was 11.47 (SD 1.85) at the start of the study compared to 6.27 (SD 1.44) at the end (P<.001). There was a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression measured by the PHQ-9: the mean score was 10.69 (SD 2.04) at the start of the study compared to 6.69 (SD 2.41) at the end (P=.001). Both the intervention and comparison groups independently had significant improvements in the TestWell Wellness Inventory from pretest to posttest. The subgroups in the social awareness and spirituality inventories showed significant improvement in the intervention group. In a subgroup of participants (11/49, 22%) where the GAD-7 was available during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in anxiety from the start of the study (mean score 11.63, SD 2.16) to mid-March (ie, onset of the pandemic) (mean score 13.03, SD 1.48; P=.23), followed by a significant decrease at the end of the study period (mean score 5.9, SD 1.44; P=.001).

"A Novel Concentrated, Interdisciplinary Group Rehabilitation Program for Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Protocol for a Nonrandomized Clinical Intervention Study",Not mental health,"Frisk, B; Njoten, KL; Aarli, B; Hystad, SW; Rykken, S; Kjosås, A; Softeland, E; Kvale, G",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2022,"Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation has been demonstrated to be a highly effective treatment for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, its availability is scarce worldwide, and new and innovative rehabilitation models are highly warranted. Recently, the group behind the present study published a protocol describing a novel concentrated, interdisciplinary group rehabilitation program for patients with chronic illnesses. The current paper describes an extension of this protocol to patients with COPD. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore the acceptability of concentrated, interdisciplinary group pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with COPD. The intervention is expected to improve functional status and be highly acceptable to patients. Methods: This study will include 50 patients aged over 40 years who fulfill the diagnostic criteria for COPD: a forced expiratory volume at the first second (FEV1) <80% of expected and a FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio below the lower limit of normal according to the Global Lung Function Initiative. An interdisciplinary team consisting of physicians, physiotherapists, psychologists, pharmacists, clinical nutritionists, and nurses will deliver the treatment to groups of 6 to 10 patients over 3 to 4 consecutive days with a 12-month follow-up. The intervention is divided into three distinct phases: (1) pretreatment preparation for change, (2) concentrated rehabilitation, where the patient is coached to focus on making health-promoting microchoices, and (3) integration of the changes into everyday living, aided by digital follow-up and 2 on-site clinical examinations. Statistical significance will be set at alpha=.05. Results: The recruitment period will last from April 2022 until June 2023. Conclusions: If successful, this highly novel rehabilitation format might change the way we deliver care for patients with COPD, leading to substantial societal and socioeconomic gains. The study will expand knowledge on the concentrated treatment format as a rehabilitation model for people with COPD.

Such alterations have been implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and the use of probiotics as therapy for these diseases remains promising. However, the mechanisms underlying the gut microenvironment's influence on disease pathogenesis and therapy remain unclear. Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a novel probiotic formula, BIOCG, on cognitive function and pathobiological mechanisms, including amyloid processing and dendritic spine dynamics, in a mouse model of AD. Methods: BIOCG was administered for 3 months to 3xTg or 3xTg; Thy1-YFP AD mice and functional outcomes were assessed via behavioral testing and electrophysiology. Mechanisms relevant to AD pathogenesis including dendritic spine morphology and turnover, Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) processing and microglial phenotype were also evaluated. Finally, we sequenced fecal samples following probiotic treatment to assess the impact on gut microbial composition and correlate the changes with the above described measures. Results: Mice treated with BIOCG demonstrated preserved cognitive abilities and stronger Long Term Potentiation (LTP), spontaneous Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents (sEPSC), and glutamate -induced LTPs, indicative of functional and electrophysiological effects. Moreover, we observed attenuated AD pathogenesis, including reduced Amyloid Beta (A beta) burden, as well as more mature dendritic spines in the BIOCG-treated. Our finding of changes in microglial number and phenotype in the treatment group suggests that this formulation may mediate its effectsvia attenuation of neuroinflammation. Sequencing data confirmed that the gut microbiome in treated mice was more varied and harbored a greater proportion of beneficial bacteria. Conclusion: Overall, our results indicate that treatment with BIOCG enhances microbial diversity and, through gut-brain axis interactions, attenuates neuroinflammation to produce histologic and functional improvement in AD pathogenesis.",10.2174/1567205018666211022091110,"pubmed, wos",Neurosciences & Neurology,Alzheimer's Disease (AD); probiotics; in vivo imaging; dendritic spine; synaptic plasticity; inflammation,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2174/1567205018666211022091110)

This study examined a cognitive-behavior therapy-based parent-targeted group intervention, including understudied/novel resilience/risk (eg, distress, parenting self-regulation), and compared the effect of in-person versus virtual delivery format. Hypotheses:(1) Adequate feasibility and acceptability (enrolment>33%, attendance >60%, attrition <25%, satisfaction ratings >90%), with higher indicators of feasibility in the virtual groups; (2) Significant improvements in parent psychological flexibility, protectiveness, distress, and parenting self-regulation at posttreatment that were maintained at follow-up, with no difference between delivery type. Methods:Parents were enroled from an outpatient pediatric chronic pain clinic and participated in the group intervention in-person or virtually; questionnaires were completed at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results:Enrolment (55% in-person, 65% virtual) and attendance (86% in-person, 93% virtual) were higher, and attrition was lower than expected (4% in-person, 7% virtual).

As a result, children may be susceptible to anxiety and digital eye strain, highlighting a need for population interventions. Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate whether a digital behavior change intervention aimed at promoting physical activity could reduce children's anxiety and digital eye strain while undergoing prolonged homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this cluster randomized controlled trial, homeschooled grade 7 students at 12 middle schools in southern China were recruited through local schools and randomly assigned by the school to receive (1:1 allocation): (1) health education information promoting exercise and ocular relaxation, and access to a digital behavior change intervention, with live streaming and peer sharing of promoted activities (intervention), or (2) health education information only (control). The primary outcome was change in self-reported anxiety score. Secondary outcomes included change in self-reported eye strain and sleep quality. Results: On March 16, 2020, 1009 children were evaluated, and 954 (94.5%) eligible children of consenting families were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

A Personalized Mobile Cessation Intervention to Promote Smokers From the Preparation Stage to the Action Stage: Double-blind Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Lin, HX; Wang, Y; Xing, YL; Han, YL; Zhang, CQ; Luo, T; Chang, C",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Most mobile cessation studies have found that such interventions have a higher quitting rate than interventions providing minimal smoking cessation support. However, why such interventions are effective has been almost unstudied by researchers. Objective: This paper describes the principles of the personalized mobile cessation intervention-based WeChat app and used generalized estimated equations to assess why a personalized mobile cessation intervention was more likely to promote smokers from the preparation stage to the action stage than a nonpersonalized intervention. Methods: This is a 2-arm, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in five cities in China. The intervention group received a personalized mobile cessation intervention. The control group received a nonpersonalized SMS text message smoking cessation intervention. All information was sent by the WeChat app. The outcomes were the change in protection motivation theory construct scores and the change in transtheoretical model stages. Results: A total of 722 participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Compared with those who received the nonpersonalized SMS text message intervention, smokers who received the personalized intervention presented lower intrinsic rewards, extrinsic rewards, and response costs. Intrinsic rewards were determinants of stage change, thus explaining why the intervention group was more likely to promote smokers from the preparation stage to the action stage (odds ratio 2.65, 95% CI 1.41-4.98). Conclusions: This study identified the psychological determinants at different stages to facilitate smokers moving forward to the next stage of quitting behavior and provides a framework to explore why a smoking cessation intervention is effective.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2100041942; https://tinyurl.com/2hhx4m7f",10.2196/41911,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,smoking cessation; mobile health; health education; smoking; behavior intervention; behavior change; support; text message; personalized; smoking abstinence; health behavior; health promotion,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/41911)

A Pilot Study of a Three-Session Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback Intervention for Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,Other,"Schuman, DL; Lawrence, KA; Boggero, I; Naegele, P; Ginsberg, JP; Casto, A; Moser, DK",APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK,2023,"Many veterans do not complete traditional trauma treatments; others may continue to struggle with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) even after completing a full course of therapy (Blase et al., in Int J Environ Res Public Health 18(7):Article 3329, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073329, 2016). Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback (HRVB) is a non-invasive, non-pharmacological, breathing-based cardiorespiratory training technique that can reduce trauma symptoms and improve HRV parameters. Prior studies have demonstrated HRVB is well-tolerated by veterans with PTSD symptoms (Tan et al., in Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback 36(1):27-35, 10.1007/s10484-010-9141-y, 2011; Schuman and Killian, in Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback 44(1):9-20, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10484-018-9415-3, 2019). This randomized wait-list controlled pilot study tested a short mobile app-adapted HRVB intervention in combination with treatment as usual for veterans with military-related PTSD to determine if further investigation was warranted. We assessed veterans' military-related PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and HRV time and frequency domain measures at baseline, after three clinical sessions, and one month later. This study combined clinical training and home biofeedback with a smartphone app and sensor to reinforce training and validate adherence. In the intervention group, depression and SDNN significantly improved, and we observed marginally significant improvements for PTSD Cluster B (intrusion) symptoms, whereas no significant improvements were observed in the control group. In addition, the brief protocol was acceptable to veterans with PTSD with over 83% of participants completing the study. However, adherence to home practice was low.

A Qualitative Literature Search and Pilot Study of Online Support Groups for Patients With Dementia and Their Carers,Good,"Constantini, J; Bliem, HR; Crepaz, M; Marksteiner, J",GERONTOLOGY AND GERIATRIC MEDICINE,2023,"The ever-growing group of people living with dementia (PLWD) and their relatives face great challenges. The Covid 19 pandemic has once again placed a particular challenge on this vulnerable group. What started a decade earlier with telephone-based support groups experienced a real push during the pandemic in the form of video-based self-help services. The aim of this qualitative literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO with keywords related to online, support group, caregiver, and dementia was to collect the reported experiences by the end of 2022. Peer reviewed journal papers were included when published and written in English. After the joint decision of two reviewers, it was decided to only include studies that were published in Medline. The results of the literature search are compared with experiences of the participants in a presentation group that was transformed into an online group at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic via Zoom. In search yielded a total of 129 articles. 113 articles described different types of interventions, 30 of which had a randomized design. The qualitative literature search showed on the one hand a high interest in online support groups but on the other hand that the effectiveness and efficacy in randomized trials is much less clear. In addition, we investigated the assessments and experiences of the participants in a presentation group that was transformed into an online group at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic via Zoom. This study demonstrates that PLWD and carers on virtual group meetings can express significant emotive capacity and enhanced connectivity with one another despite a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia. Further research on entry criteria, concerns about online support services in general and necessary support for use is essential to develop the time- and location-independent possibility of video-based online self-help into an important form of support for both PLWD and their caregivers as an additional support option independent of exceptional pandemic situations.",10.1177/23337214231205689,wos,Geriatrics & Gerontology,dementia; Alzheimer; PLWD; care givers; self help; online self help; videobased self help; videobased support group,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1177/23337214231205689)
A Randomised Controlled Trial Study of the Effects of a Digital Divorce Platform on Mental and Physical Health,Good,"Sander, S; Hald, GM; Cipric, A; Overup, CS; Strizzi, JM; Kjeld, SG; Lange, T",APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-HEALTH AND WELL BEING,2020,"Background Two decades of divorce research has consistently documented adverse mental and physical health effects of divorce. Responding to calls for evidence-based online divorce interventions, this study tests effects of the Cooperation after Divorce (CAD) digital intervention platform on divorcees' mental and physical health. Methods Randomised control trial 12-month longitudinal study using a sample of 1,856 newly divorced Danes. Mental and physical health were measured using the SF-36 at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline. Intervention effects were investigated using linear mixed effect models and Cohen's (d) for effect sizes. Results The study found significant treatment effects of the CAD intervention on mental and physical health. These effects were evident across all eight health domains constituting the mental and physical health components. The study also found that the intervention group had significantly better mental health than the control group at subsequent 6- and 12-month assessments from baseline while for physical health, the intervention group had significantly better physical health at the 6-month assessment from baseline only. Conclusion The results indicate that digital solutions allowing for individually tailored user experiences may hold great potential in reducing well-known adverse health effects of divorce.

Part 2: Patient Related Outcome Measures,Not mental health,"Sancho-Puchades, M; Alfaro, FH; Naenni, N; Jung, R; Hämmerle, C; Schneider, D",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PERIODONTICS & RESTORATIVE DENTISTRY,2019,"The objective of this study was to compare patient-related outcomes of conventional protocols with computer-assisted implant planning and template-guided implant placement (CAIPP) protocols. Partially edentulous patients (N = 73) were assigned to either surgical planning based on two-dimensional radiographs and freehand implant placement (control; n = 26) or using three-dimensional computer-tomography data and implant placement using a tooth-supported surgical guide (test groups T1 [n = 24] and T2 [n = 23]). The two test groups differed from each other in digital data acquisition, software functionality, and the guide-manufacturing process. All surgeries were performed as open-flap procedures. Patient-related outcome measures were evaluated using questionnaires. Statistical tests were performed to investigate differences between treatment groups. Before treatment, 53% of patients in the control group and 83% of patients in the test groups (T1: 88%, T2: 78%) were satisfied with their group allocation. In the control group, 37% of patients favored CAIPP technology, while only 11% in the test groups would have preferred a conventional procedure. After treatment, 50% of patients in the control and 86% in the test groups (T1: 76%, 72: 94%) were satisfied with their allocation. Twenty-one percent of control-group patients favored the CAIPP treatment, while 6% of the test-group patients would have preferred a conventional treatment. The quality-of-life parameters during and after surgery did not show significant differences between groups. More postoperative discomfort was reported after longer and more-complex surgeries including guided bone regeneration and surgeries with two surgical sites. Generally, patients preferred computer-based technologies. No differences in the intra- or postoperative discomfort were observed compared to control protocols.

A Randomized Controlled Trial to Assess the Use of a Virtual Decisional Aid to Improve Knowledge and Patient Satisfaction in Women Considering Breast Reconstruction Following Mastectomy,Not mental health,"Varelas, L; Egro, FM; Evankovich, N; Nguyen, V",CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,2020,"Background The decisional process of navigating breast reconstruction surgery is very challenging for patients with a breast cancer diagnosis. This study aims to assess the impact of a virtual breast reconstruction decision aid program on the decision-making process of breast cancer patients considering breast reconstruction. Methods A two-arm, randomized, controlled trial was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh. Patients were blindly assigned to one of two arms: Emmi Decide (Emmi Solutions LLC, Chicago, IL) program prior to traditional consultation (intervention) and traditional consultation alone (control). All patients completed a baseline pre- and post-intervention questionnaire to evaluate knowledge, patient satisfaction, and psychological status. Surgeons' satisfaction and consultation time were also recorded. Results A total of 26 patients participated in the study (n=13 in each arm). Patients in the intervention group reported a greater BREAST-Q reconstruction module score (control=17.9 +/- 8.2, intervention=56.8 +/- 1.2, p=0.0017), lower decisional conflict scale score (control=30.2 +/- 11.8, intervention=14.5 +/- 8.8, p=0.017), and improved patient knowledge (control-70.8 +/- 15.5%, intervention=83.1 +/- 13.8%, p=0.018). No difference was noted in consultation time (control=51.0 +/- 7.8 min, intervention=47.8 +/- 13.7 min, p=0.46) and psychological testing (control=49.7 +/- 16.0, intervention=44.6 +/- 15.2, p = 0.26). However, surgeons reported greater satisfaction with their consultations with interventional group participants (control=3.4 +/- 0.7, intervention=4.8 +/- 0.4, p=0.000056). Conclusions The use of a virtual decisional aid program to assist the decision-making of breast reconstruction patients was shown to significantly benefit both patients and surgeons, by improving patient knowledge and satisfaction without placing an additional psychological burden on them.

"A Randomized, Crossover Pilot Study of a Novel Web-Based/Mobile Platform for Collaborative Small Group Practice in Therapeutic Reasoning",Good,"Gruenberg, K; Brock, T; Garcia, J; MacDougall, C",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Therapeutic reasoning-the mental process of making judgments and decisions about treatment-is developed through acquisition of knowledge and application in actual or simulated experiences. Health professions education frequently uses collaborative small group work to practice therapeutic reasoning. This pilot study compared the impact of a web-based/mobile tool for collaborative case work and discussion to usual practice on student perceptions and performance on questions designed to test therapeutic knowledge and reasoning. METHODS: In a therapeutics course that includes case-based workshops, student teams of 3 to 4 were randomly assigned to usual workshop preparation (group SOAP sheet) or preparation using the Practice Improvement using Virtual Online Training (PIVOT) platform. PIVOT was also used in the workshop to review the case and student responses. The next week, groups crossed over to the other condition. Students rated favorability with the preparatory and in-workshop experiences and provided comments about the PIVOT platform via a survey. Student performance on examination items related to the 2 workshop topics was compared. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven students (94%) completed post-workshop surveys after both workshops. The majority of students (57%) preferred using the PIVOT platform for workshop collaboration. Favorability ratings for the in-workshop experience did not change significantly from first to second study week, regardless of sequence of exposure. There was no relationship between examination item scores and the workshop platform the students were exposed to for that content (P = .29). Student responses highlighted the efficiency of working independently before collaborating as a group and the ability to see other students' thought processes as valuable aspects of PIVOT. Students expressed frustration with the PIVOT user interface and the lack of anonymity when discussing their answers in the workshop. CONCLUSION: A web-based/mobile platform for student team collaboration on therapeutic reasoning cases discussed in small group settings yielded favorable ratings, examination performance comparable to standard approaches, and was preferred by a majority of students. During the rapid shift to substantial online learning for the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual collaboration tools like PIVOT may help health professions teachers to better support groups working virtually on scaffolded therapeutic reasoning tasks.",10.1177/2382120520977189,"pubmed, wos",Education & Educational Research,Education technology; collaborative learning; small group instruction; randomized trial; clinical reasoning; therapeutic reasoning,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1177/2382120520977189)

Materials and Methods: Participants sat at a low-friction robotic table with tilt and lift capability and interacted with serious games through computerized supports that measured forearm movement and grasp. The rehabilitation simulations were designed to improve arm and hand function, increase range of motion, and improve emotional well-being and cognition (attention, memory, and executive functioning). After 8 weeks of initial intensive therapy, there were three booster periods at 8-week intervals, each consisting of four sessions over 2 weeks. The last booster was a tournament competition, where pairs of residents played games collaboratively from remote nursing homes. Participants were evaluated before and after each booster period using standardized clinical measures. Results: Range of motion improved for 18 out of 23 upper extremity movement variables (P = 0.01) between pre- and post-tournament assessment, and the residents self-reported that they enjoyed playing with a partner (score of 4.7 out of 5.0). Participants were able to reduce game completion time through cooperative play (teamwork), and the times improved with successive sessions of the tournament. Affected hand and arm function and depression levels were maintained (no decline) after the tournament. Conclusions: A rehabilitation tournament using virtual reality between teams of nursing home residents chronic poststroke is the first of its kind in clinical practice.

"A Self-Compassion and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Mobile Intervention (Serene) for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress: Promoting Adaptive Emotional Regulation and Wisdom",Not Multi User,"Al-Refae, M; Al-Refae, A; Munroe, M; Sardella, NA; Ferrari, M",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2021,"Introduction: Many individuals and families are currently experiencing a high level of COVID-19-related stress and are struggling to find helpful coping mechanisms. Mindfulness-based interventions are becoming an increasingly popular treatment for individuals experiencing depression and chronic levels of stress. The app (Serene) draws from scholarly evidence on the efficacy of mindfulness meditations and builds on the pre-existing apps by incorporating techniques that are used in some therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to a 4-week mindfulness and self-compassion-based cognitive smartphone intervention (Serene) or a wait-list control group. They were instructed to engage in self-compassion and mindfulness practices and a cognitive restructuring task. They also completed measures that evaluated their levels of depression, stress, anxiety, self-compassion, wisdom, psychological well-being, and subjective well-being. The intervention group was also instructed to track their weekly engagement with the app. Standardized effect sizes for between-group differences were calculated using Cohen's d for complete case analyses. Results: Complete case analyses from baseline to the end of this randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant moderate between-group differences for depressive symptoms (d = -0.43) and decisiveness (d = 0.34). Moderate between-group differences were also found for self-compassion (d = 0.6) such that significant improvements in self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness and decreases in self-judgement, isolation, and overidentification were observed. A small between-group difference was found for emotional regulation (d = 0.28). Moreover, a significant moderate within-group decrease in stress (d = -0.52) and anxiety symptoms (d = -0.47) was also observed in the intervention group. Conclusions: Serene is an effective intervention that promotes increased levels of self-compassion and emotional regulation. Engaging with Serene may help reduce depressive symptoms through mindfulness, self-compassion, and cognitive restructuring which help reduce overidentification with one's negative emotions. As individuals rebalance their thinking through cognitive restructuring, they can identify the varying stressors in their life, develop action plans and engage in adaptive coping strategies to address them. Serene may promote greater self-understanding which may provide one with a more balanced perspective on their current upsetting situations to positively transform their challenges during the pandemic.",10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648087,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,mindfulness; self-compassion; serene; depression; wisdom; emotion regulation; app; CBT,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648087)
A Self-Help App for Syrian Refugees With Posttraumatic Stress (Sanadak): Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Röhr, S; Jung, FU; Pabst, A; Grochtdreis, T; Dams, J; Nagl, M; Renner, A; Hoffmann, R; König, HH; Kersting, A; Riedel-Heller, SG",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2021,"Background: Syrian refugees residing in Germany often develop posttraumatic stress as a result of the Syrian civil war, their escape, and postmigration stressors. At the same time, there is a lack of adequate treatment options. The smartphone-based app Sanadak was developed to provide cognitive behavioral therapy based self-help in the Arabic language for Syrian refugees with posttraumatic stress. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the app. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, eligible individuals were randomly allocated to the intervention group (IG; app use) or control group (CG; psychoeducational reading material). Data were collected during structured face-to-face interviews at 3 assessments (preintervention/baseline, postintervention/after 4 weeks, follow-up/after 4 months). Using adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models, changes in posttraumatic stress and secondary outcomes were investigated as intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated based on adjusted mean total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves using the net benefit approach. Results: Of 170 screened individuals (aged 18 to 65 years), 133 were eligible and randomized to the IG (n=65) and CG (n=68). Although there was a pre-post reduction in posttraumatic stress, ITT showed no significant differences between the IG and CG after 4 weeks (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale for DSM-5, Diff -0.90, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.47; P=.52) and after 4 months (Diff -0.39, 95% CI -3.24 to 2.46; P=.79). The same was true for PP. Regarding secondary outcomes, ITT indicated a treatment effect for self-stigma . after 4 weeks (Self-Stigma of Mental Illness Scale/SSMIS-stereotype agreement: d=0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.25; stereotype application: d=0.60, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99) and after 4 months (d=0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.92; d=0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.90), the IG showed significantly lower values in self-stigma than the CG. ITT showed no significant group differences in total costs and QALYs. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 81% for a willingness-to-pay of (Sic)0 per additional QALY but decreased with increasing willingness-to-pay. Conclusions: Sanadak was not more effective in reducing mild to moderate posttraumatic stress in Syrian refugees than the control condition nor was it likely to be cost-effective. Therefore, Sanadak is not suitable as a standalone treatment. However, as the app usability was very good, no harms detected, and stigma significantly reduced, Sanadak has potential as a bridging aid within a stepped and collaborative care approach.",10.2196/24807,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,app; cost-utility analysis; mHealth; posttraumatic stress; PTSD; quality-adjusted life years; randomized controlled trial; refugees; stimga; Syrian refugees; usability,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/24807)

Methods: We focused on participants recruited from June 2020 to May 2021 in the context of a European multicenter project including four university/academic sites. The total number of participants in the longitudinal studies was 107 (study 1, N = 40; study 2, N = 29; study 3, N = 38). The randomized controlled trial (study 4) included 31 participants in total, 16 in the intervention group and 15 in the control group. Primary outcome measures were depression, anxiety, stress symptoms, perceived stress level, and perceived hopelessness. The secondary outcome was experienced social connectedness. Results: Using separate linear mixed-effects models, the most consistent result across countries was a reduction in perceived stress after the participation in the COVID Feel Good intervention. By pooling the results of the models using a random-effects meta-analysis, we found that after the COVID Feel Good intervention, participants reported a decrease in perceived general distress (mean standardized effect size for general distress in the treatment groups compared with the control conditions was -0.52 [p = .008, 95% confidence interval = -0.89 to -0.14]) and an increase in the perceived social connection (mean standardized effect size for social connection using COVID Feel Good compared with the control conditions was 0.50 [p <= .001, 95% confidence interval = 0.25 to 0.76]).

An app was designed to encourage Sharing, Mind, and Enjoyment (SME) between students and their parents (e.g., express gratitude), including interaction and game elements. The app was used daily over 1 month. The waitlist control group was offered the app after completing all assessments. The primary outcomes were changes in SME behaviors measured at 1 month and 3 months. Secondary outcomes included subjective happiness, well-being, personal health and happiness, family health, happiness and harmony, self-perceived knowledge, and understanding of anxious symptoms. Two focus groups of students and three individual in-depth interviews of community partners were conducted.Results: Seventeen of 152 students (11.2%) in the intervention group used the app together with parents (adherent subgroup) and 69 (45.4%) used it without involving parents. The intervention group did not show significant difference in the change of SME behaviors at 1- or 3-month follow-up compared with the control group. However, the intervention group reported greater increase in the awareness of anxious symptoms at follow-ups than the control group (d = 0.52 at 1 month and d = 0.43 at 3 month, both P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis showed a significantly greater increase in SME-related behaviors in the adherent subgroup than the control group at 3 months (d = 0.46, P = 0.04). The interviews found favorable changes in app users, but motivation to use the app was low in general. Both students and community partners suggested primary school students would be more receptive users.Conclusions: The app did not show effectiveness in increasing SME behaviors of students, but increased awareness of anxious symptoms.

In mental health care, SDM has been advocated as a means for the patient to gain or regain control and responsibility over their life and recovery process. To support the process of patient-centered care and SDM, digital tools may have advantages in terms of accessibility, structure, and reminders. Objective: In this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to investigate the effect of a digital tool to support patient activation and SDM. Methods: The trial was designed as a randomized, assessor-blinded, 2-armed, parallel-group multicenter trial investigating the use of a digital SDM intervention for 6 months compared with treatment as usual. Participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorder were recruited from 9 outpatient treatment sites in the Capital Region of Denmark. The primary outcome was the self-reported level of activation at the postintervention time point. The secondary outcomes included self-efficacy, hope, working alliance, satisfaction, preparedness for treatment consultation, symptom severity, and level of functioning. Explorative outcomes on the effect of the intervention at the midintervention time point along with objective data on the use of the digital tool were collected. Results: In total, 194 participants were included. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed a statistically significant effect favoring the intervention group on patient activation (mean difference 4.39, 95% CI 0.99-7.79; Cohen d=0.33; P=.01), confidence in communicating with one's provider (mean difference 1.85, 95% CI 0.01-3.69; Cohen d=0.24; P=.05), and feeling prepared for decision-making (mean difference 5.12, 95% CI 0.16-10.08; Cohen d=0.27; P=.04). We found no effect of the digital SDM tool on treatment satisfaction, hope, self-efficacy, working alliance, severity of symptoms, level of functioning, use of antipsychotic medicine, and number or length of psychiatric hospital admissions. Conclusions: This trial showed a significant effect of a digital SDM tool on the subjective level of patient activation, confidence in communicating with one's provider, and feeling prepared for decision-making at the postintervention time point. The effect size was smaller than the 0.42 effect size that we had anticipated and sampled for.

A Smartphone-Based Health Care Chatbot to Promote Self-Management of Chronic Pain (SELMA): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Hauser-Ulrich, S; Künzli, H; Meier-Peterhans, D; Kowatsch, T",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2020,"Background: Ongoing pain is one of the most common diseases and has major physical, psychological, social, and economic impacts. A mobile health intervention utilizing a fully automated text-based health care chatbot (TBHC) may offer an innovative way not only to deliver coping strategies and psychoeducation for pain management but also to build a working alliance between a participant and the TBHC. Objective: The objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to describe the design and implementation to promote the chatbot painSELfMAnagement (SELMA), a 2-month smartphone-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) TBHC intervention for pain self-management in patients with ongoing or cyclic pain, and (2) to present findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial, in which effectiveness, influence of intention to change behavior, pain duration, working alliance, acceptance, and adherence were evaluated. Methods: Participants were recruited online and in collaboration with pain experts, and were randomized to interact with SELMA for 8 weeks either every day or every other day concerning CBT-based pain management (n=59), or weekly concerning content not related to pain management (n=43). Pain-related impairment (primary outcome), general well-being, pain intensity, and the bond scale of working alliance were measured at baseline and postintervention. Intention to change behavior and pain duration were measured at baseline only, and acceptance postintervention was assessed via self-reporting instruments. Adherence was assessed via usage data. Results: From May 2018 to August 2018, 311 adults downloaded the SELMA app, 102 of whom consented to participate and met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the women (88/102, 86.4%) and men (14/102, 13.6%) participating was 43.7 (SD 12.7) years. Baseline group comparison did not differ with respect to any demographic or clinical variable. The intervention group reported no significant change in pain-related impairment (P=.68) compared to the control group postintervention. The intention to change behavior was positively related to pain-related impairment (P=.01) and pain intensity (P=.01). Working alliance with the TBHC SELMA was comparable to that obtained in guided internet therapies with human coaches. Participants enjoyed using the app, perceiving it as useful and easy to use. Participants of the intervention group replied with an average answer ratio of 0.71 (SD 0.20) to 200 (SD 58.45) conversations initiated by SELMA. Participants' comments revealed an appreciation of the empathic and responsible interaction with the TBHC SELMA. A main criticism was that there was no option to enter free text for the patients' own comments. Conclusions: SELMA is feasible, as revealed mainly by positive feedback and valuable suggestions for future revisions. For example, the participants' intention to change behavior or a more homogenous sample (eg, with a specific type of chronic pain) should be considered in further tailoring of SELMA.",10.2196/15806,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,conversational agent; chatbot; digital health; pain self-management; cognitive behavior therapy; smartphone; psychoeducation; text-based; health care; chronic pain,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/15806)
A Smartphone-Based Implicit Theories Intervention for Health Behavior Change: Randomized Trial,Not Multi User,"Schreiber, M; Dohle, S",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2023,"Background: Implicit theories of health describe individuals' beliefs about the malleability of health. Individuals with an incremental theory of health believe that health, in general, is malleable, whereas individuals with an entity theory of health endorse the idea that health is largely fixed and predetermined. Previous research has shown that an incremental theory of health is associated with beneficial health outcomes and behaviors. A mobile health implicit theories intervention could be an effective way to increase health-promoting behaviors in the general population.Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of a smartphone-based intervention designed to promote an incremental theory of health on the frequency of health-promoting behaviors in everyday life. The study used ecological momentary assessment to measure health behavior change.Methods: This 2-arm, single-blind, delayed intervention design included 149 German participants (mean age 30.58, SD 9.71 years; n=79 female). Participants were asked to report their engagement in 10 health-promoting behaviors throughout the day for 3 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to either an early intervention group (n=72) or a delayed intervention group (n=77). The intervention materials, designed to promote an incremental theory of health, were provided to participants after 1 week (early intervention group) or 2 weeks (delayed intervention group) of baseline behavior measurement. Data for this study Results: A paired-samples 2-tailed t test revealed that participants reported a stronger incremental theory after responding to the intervention materials (mean 5.58, SE 0.07) compared with incremental theory measured in an entry questionnaire (mean 5.29, SE 0.08; t148=4.07, SE 0.07; P<.001; 95% CI 0.15-0.43; d=0.33). Multilevel analyses showed that participants reported engaging in health-promoting behaviors more often after being presented with the intervention materials compared with baseline across conditions (b=0.14; t146.65=2.06, SE 0.07; P=.04; 95% CI 0.01-0.28). However, when the analysis was conducted separately for the early and delayed intervention groups, the intervention effect was only significant for the delayed intervention group (b=0.27; t1492.37=3.50, SE 0.08; P<.001; 95% CI 0.12-0.42). There was no significant increase in health-promoting behaviors for the early intervention group (b=0.02; t69.23=0.14, SE 0.11;P=.89; 95% CI -0.2 to 0.23).Conclusions: This study suggests that a smartphone-based intervention designed to promote an incremental theory of health is a cost- and time-effective approach to increase the frequency of engaging in health-promoting behaviors. However, research is needed to understand the reasons for the difference in intervention effects between the early and delayed intervention groups. The results of this study can guide the development of future digital health interventions that focus on implicit theories to promote health behavior change",10.2196/36578,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,daily diary; ecological momentary assessment; health behavior; implicit theories; lay theories; mindsets; multiple health behavior,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/36578)
"A Social Exergame Intervention to Promote Physical Activity, Social Support, and Well-Being in Family Caregivers",Good,"Lin, XY; Zhang, L; Yoon, S; Zhang, RY; Lachman, ME",GERONTOLOGIST,2023,"Background and Objectives Family caregivers often experience a high level of stress, social isolation, a sedentary lifestyle, and poor mental and physical health. An exergame intervention was developed to promote physical activity and well-being in family caregivers and to test social support as a mechanism for behavior change. Research Design and Methods The current study was a randomized pilot trial (N = 76) to compare the effectiveness of Go&Grow (social vs nonsocial exergame) to promote well-being through increased social support and physical activity for family caregivers over a 6-week intervention. Results The treatment group increased significantly more than the control group in well-being (management of distress) and social support (satisfaction with contact quality). Social support served as a mechanism (mediator and moderator): The treatment group increased more than the control group in satisfaction with social contact quality, which led to more positive affect and less loneliness. Moreover, those in the treatment group who increased more in overall social support and knowing others' experiences increased their steps more than those with less support, whereas the change in steps for the control group was not related to a support level. Those in the treatment group who used more social features of the app had a greater increase in steps compared with those who used it less. Discussion and Implications Social support in technology interventions is a promising direction to promote caregivers' well-being and physical activity. Social support served as a mechanism of behavior change that can inform more engaging, sustainable, portable, and scalable interventions in the future for sedentary and socially isolated family caregivers.

A Study of Family Process Factors of Social Anxiety on the Internet Based on Big Data-Take Guangxi University Students as an Example,Good,"Bi, DX",FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,2022,"BackgroundAlong with the popularization of the new medium of interpersonal communication, many researchers have found that the use of social media has brought about many mental health problems. For example, the virtual nature, vulnerability, and uncertainty of online communication lead to reduced online trust, causing interaction anxiety (IA). The data footprints left on the Internet are processed by malicious elements for big data, leading to the leakage of personal privacy data, bringing content sharing anxiety (SAC) and privacy concern anxiety (PAC), which are all typical forms of online social anxiety. In the face of this situation, analyzing the influence of online social networking on the social psychology of university students and guiding it has become an inevitable issue in the Internet era. MethodsLearning from the classification of family environment, a self-administered family process factor questionnaire and the Social Anxiety Scale for Social Media Users (SAS-SMU) were used to investigate the online social anxiety of Guangxi University students. The study used SPSS26.0 and Stata for data analysis and descriptive statistics, ANOVA, t-test, and linear regression analysis were used to explore the relationship between family process factors and online social anxiety of the university students. ResultsThe results showed that except for parental supervision (p > 0.05), the effects of interparental relationship, parent-child relationship, sibling relationship, and family atmosphere on university students' online social anxiety were statistically significant and showed positive correlations (F/t = 6.64, 3.53, 4.15, 5.94; p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that university students' total online social anxiety score = 36.914-4.09 x good parental relationship-4.16 x good family atmosphere-3.42 x good sibling relationship. ConclusionsBased on the family systems theory, it is suggested that a comprehensive intervention should be conducted for the coupled system (parental relationship) and sibling system (non-only child's sibling relationship) in the family and focus on the protective factors of parental harmony, sibling relationship harmony, and relaxed family atmosphere. In the specific implementation method, the collaborative shared healthcare plan (CSHCP) can be used to strengthen remote family emotional interaction and avoid Internet addiction. For university students with online social anxiety disorders, their personal health records (PHRs) can be maintained permanently and safely using the Star File System (IPFS), in addition to the convenience of IPFS data extraction, which is more conducive to the timely and long-term tracking treatment of anxious university students.",10.3389/fpubh.2022.870822,"pubmed, wos","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",family systems theory; Guangxi University students; online social anxiety; family process factors; big data,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.870822)
A Study of the Effectiveness of Mobile Health Application in A Self-management Intervention for Kidney Transplant Patients,Not mental health,"Xie, XY; Wang, XJ; Li, AQ; Yan, YH; Lu, T; Wu, Y; Lin, Z",IRANIAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES,2023,"Introduction: With the development of information technology in medical treatment, mobile medical treatment has become a new way to seek treatment, follow-up, extended care, popular science, disease prevention and access to disease expertise. The application of mobile medical treatment is relatively mature in the management of chronic diseases. Currently, mobile medical intervention is also introduced in the self-management of patients after Renal Transplantation. Compared with traditional intervention methods, mobile medical treatment has the advantages of convenience, speed, low cost and no geographical restriction, and it is easy to be used by KT recipients in self-management and has good feasibility. Therefore, we conducted self-management intervention for patients after Renal Transplantation based on mobile medical procedures, so as to improve patients' satisfaction, medication compliance, follow-up rate, and ease patients' anxiety about the disease.Methods: A total of 160 discharged patients with stable recovery of transplanted Renal function who underwent renal transplantation surgery in our hospital from January 2021 to January 2023 were selected for retrospective analysis. According to the different intervention plan, the patients were divided into the intervention group and the comparison group, 80 cases each. Among them, the intervention group used the mobile medical application selfmanagement behavior intervention, and the comparison group used the conventional self-management behavior intervention. The differences of self-management behavior score, quality of life score, Basel score and anxiety score between the two groups of patients after Renal Transplantation were analyzed and compared.Results: After intervention, there were statistically significant differences in the scores of self-management behavior scale, Quality of life related rating scale, Basel Assessment scale and Self-rating Anxiety Scale between the intervention group and the control group (P < .05).Conclusion: Mobile health intervention tools can provide efficient, comprehensive and accurate remote health intervention and professional support for patients, optimize the medical service system, and meet the social medical needs of high-quality nursing services.",10.52547/ijkd.7693,wos,Urology & Nephrology,mobile health; app; renal transplantation; self-management; mobile; application effectiveness,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.52547/ijkd.7693)
A Systematic Review of the Effectiveness of Virtual Reality-Based Interventions on Pain and Range of Joint Movement Associated with Burn Injuries,Not mental health,"Garrido-Ardila, EM; Santos-Domínguez, M; Rodríguez-Mansilla, J; Torres-Piles, ST; Rodríguez-Domínguez, MT; González-Sánchez, B; Jiménez-Palomares, M",JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE,2022,"Background: Burns are mild or severe lesions produced in living tissue, due to the action of different agents. This pathology is considered the third cause of accidental death in the world by the World Health Organization. Among the most disabling sequelae in these patients, pain and range of motion have the greatest impact. A recommended tool to complement the treatment or management of the symptoms associated with burns is virtual reality. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyse the effectiveness of virtual-reality therapy for pain relief and the improvement of the range of joint movement in patients who have suffered burns. Methodology: This study is a systematic review conducted following the PRISMA statements. An electronic literature search was performed in the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane, Dialnet, Scopus and Science Direct. The inclusion criteria were: participants with burns in any part of the body, interventions with virtual reality with or without complementary treatment, studies in both Spanish and English, and outcome measures of pain and range of motion. Results: Finally, 10 studies were included in the review. The sample consisted of one pilot study, three randomized controlled clinical trials, one prospective randomized controlled clinical trial, one control group and treatment group trial, one interventional clinical trial and three comparative studies. The most commonly used assessment tools for pain were the graphic rating scale (GRS) and for range of motion the goniometer. The use of virtual-reality games significantly reduced pain scores during physiotherapy and occupational therapy treatments as well as in nursing care. The range of motion improved significantly during virtual-reality exercises performed during a physiotherapy treatment in 33% of studies included in this review. Conclusion: The results of the studies analysed in this systematic review suggest that the use of virtual reality for the management of pain and range of movement limitations associated with burn injuries could control these symptoms and decrease their negative consequences on the person.",10.3390/jpm12081269,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine,virtual reality; therapy; burn; pain; range of motion,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3390/jpm12081269)
A Theory of Change for Web-Based Therapy and Support Services for Children and Young People: Collaborative Qualitative Exploration,Good,"Hanley, T; Sefi, A; Grauberg, J; Prescott, J; Etchebarne, A",JMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING,2021,"Background: Web-based counseling and support has become increasingly commonplace for children and young people (CYP). Currently, there is limited research that focuses on the mechanisms of change within complex telepsychology platforms, a factor that makes designing and implementing outcome measures challenging. Objective: This project aims to articulate a theory of change (ToC) for Kooth, a web-based therapy and support platform for CYP. Methods: A collaborative qualitative research design involving professional staff, academic partners, and young people was used to develop the ToC. The following three major reflective phases were engaged: a scoping workshop involving professional staff and academic partners, a series of explorative projects were completed to inform the development of the ToC, and the draft ToC was reviewed for coherence by key stakeholders (young people, online professionals, and service managers). Results: A collaboratively developed ToC was presented. This was divided into the conditions that lead to individuals wanting to access web-based therapy and support (eg, individuals wanting support there and then or quickly), the mode of service delivery (eg, skilled and experienced professionals able to build empathetic relationships with CYP), and the observed and reported changes that occur as a consequence of using the service (eg, individuals being better able to manage current and future situations). Conclusions: Developing the ToC helps to shed light on how web-based therapy and support services aid the mental health and well-being of CYP. Furthermore, it helps to understand the development of positive virtual ecosystems and can be used to devise evaluative tools for CYP telepsychology providers.",10.2196/23193,"pubmed, wos",Pediatrics,telepsychology; digital mental health; online therapy; young people; Kooth; Theory of Change; positive virtual ecosystems,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/23193)
"A Transdiagnostic, Emotion Regulation App (Eda) for Children: Design, Development, and Lessons Learned",Population,"Moltrecht, B; Patalay, P; Bear, HA; Deighton, J; Edbrooke-Childs, J",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Digital interventions, including mobile apps, represent a promising means of providing effective mental health support to children and young people. Despite the increased availability of mental health apps, there is a significant gap for this age group, especially for children (aged 10-12 years). Research investigating the effectiveness and development process of child mental health apps is limited, and the field faces persistent issues in relation to low user uptake and engagement, which is assumed to be a result of limited user involvement in the design process. Objective: This study aims to present the development and design process of a new mental health app for children that targets their emotion regulation abilities. We describe the creation of a new interdisciplinary development framework to guide the design process and explain how each activity informed different app features. Methods: The first 2 stages of the framework used a variety of methods, including weekly classroom observations over a 6-month period (20 in total); public engagement events with the target group (N=21); synthesis of the existing evidence as part of a meta-analysis; a series of co-design and participatory workshops with young users (N=33), clinicians (N=7), researchers (N=12), app developers (N=1), and designers (N=2); and finally, testing of the first high-tech prototype (N=15). Results: For the interdisciplinary framework, we drew on methods derived from the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions, the patient-clinician framework, and the Druin cooperative inquiry. The classroom observations, public engagement events, and synthesis of the existing evidence informed the first key pillars of the app and wireframes. Subsequently, a series of workshops shaped and reshaped the content and app features, including games, psychoeducational films, and practice modules. On the basis of the prototype testing sessions, we made further adjustments to improve the app. Conclusions: Although mobile apps could be highly suitable to support children's mental health on a wider scale, there is little guidance on how these interventions could be designed and developed. The involvement of young users across different design activities is very valuable. We hope that our interdisciplinary framework and description of the used methods will be helpful to others who are hoping to develop mental health apps for children and young people.",10.2196/28300,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,mHealth; participatory design; emotion regulation; interdisciplinary development; child mental health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/28300)
A Universal Mental Health-Promoting Mobile App for Adolescents: Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,Other,"Kaiser, S; Rye, M; Jakobsen, R; Martinussen, M; Hogsdal, H; Kyrrestad, H",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2023,"Background: In times of increasing mental health problems among young people, strengthening efforts to improve mental health through mental health promotion and prevention becomes increasingly important. Effective measures that support young people in coping with negative thoughts, feelings, and stress are essential, not just for the individual but also for society.Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide a description of a cluster randomized controlled trial that will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of Opp, a universal mental health-promoting mobile app for adolescents aged 13 to 19 years that provides information and exercises to better cope with stress, negative thoughts, and negative feelings. The protocol was developed in accordance with the SPIRIT checklist.Methods: An effectiveness study will be conducted with 3 measurement points: preintervention (T1), 2 weeks after the intervention (T2), and about 1 month after the intervention (T3). Adolescents will be recruited from middle and high schools in Norway and randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups. Randomization will be conducted on the school level. Opp can be downloaded from the Google Play or App Store but is password protected with a 4-digit code, which will be removed after study completion. Participants in the intervention group will receive a text message with the code to unlock the app. The participants in the intervention group can use Opp without limits on length or time of use. Objective data on how long or how often the participants use the app will not be collected. However, the second and third questionnaires for the intervention group contain app-specific questions on, for example, the use of the app.Results: Recruitment and data collection started in August and September 2022. So far, 381 adolescents have answered the first questionnaire. Data collection was expected to end in December 2022 but has had to be prolonged to approximately June 2023. The results of the study will be available in 2023 at the earliest.Conclusions: This project will contribute unique knowledge to the field, as there are few studies that have examined the effects of universal health-promoting mobile apps for adolescents. However, several limitations have to be taken into account when interpreting the results, such as randomization on the school level, the short time frame in which the study was conducted, and the lack of objective data to monitor the use of the app.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05211713; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05211713International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/42119",10.2196/42119,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",mental health promotion; mobile app; mobile phone; adolescents; Opp; teens; application; effectiveness; intervention; effect; health; health promotion,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/42119)
A Virtual Reality Curriculum to Enhance Residents? Behavioral Health Anticipatory Guidance Skills: A Pilot Trial,Not Multi User,"Real, FJ; Whitehead, M; Ollberding, NJ; Rosen, BL; Meisman, A; Crosby, LE; Klein, MD; Herbst, R",ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS,2023,"OBJECTIVE: Effective educational strategies to train and assess residents' skills in behavioral health competencies have been limited. We hypothesized that a training curriculum using virtual reality (VR) simulations would enhance residents' evidence-based skills related to behavioral health anticipatory guidance (BHAG) and motivational interviewing (MI).METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled pilot trial of our curriculum within an urban academic clinic. Intervention and control groups received four 15-minute, monthly didactics on BHAG and MI followed by VR simulations to 1) deliberately practice delivering BHAG by verbally counseling avatars, who responded real-time (intervention group) or 2) assessing pediatric respiratory distress (control group). Two months post-VR training, all residents participated in a unique VR behavioral health scenario which was recorded and coded by pediatric psychologists via an observation instrument to assess residents' skills. Differences in BHAG and MI competencies were assessed via independent samples t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables.RESULTS: Sixty-six percent (n = 55) of eligible residents com-pleted all study protocols comprising 35 intervention and 20 control participants. Intervention participants demonstrated an increase in BHAG skills (P = .002), percentage of open-ended questions asked (P = .04), and percentage of MI adherent behaviors (P = .04) when compared to the control group.CONCLUSIONS: VR may be an effective educational strategy for residents to acquire BHAG and MI skills though deliberate practice.

Parents of children with LAD are vulnerable to distress, but an evidence-based treatment has not been developed. Methods From June 2016 to November 2017, we conducted a mixed methods study to adapt and assess the virtual delivery of a mind-body group resiliency program, the Stress Management and Resiliency Training-Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP), to meet the needs of parents of children with LAD; this is an 8-session weekly group intervention. In the first phase, we conducted 4 parent focus group interviews, 2 professional focus group interviews, and 5 professional individual interviews, and 1 pilot group to adapt the SMART-3RP to target the needs of parents of children with LAD. In the second phase, we conducted a pilot wait-list controlled study to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a videoconferencing delivery of the adapted program. Parents were randomized to an immediate intervention group (IG) or wait-list control group (WC). Surveys were administered at baseline (time 1), end of intervention for the IG or 3 months post-baseline for the WC (time 2), and 3 months post treatment for the IG or end of intervention for the WC (time 3). Results Qualitative findings illustrated high levels of parental stress, with primary stressors including navigating the educational system, interactions with other parents, familial concerns, and financial and professional sacrifices. We adapted the manual to target these stressors and modified session logistics and delivery. Fifty-three parents (mean age = 46.8; 90.6% female) participated nationally in the pilot trial. 62.5% of participants completed >= 6/8 sessions; 81.8% reported continued daily/weekly relaxation response exercise practice.

Objective: We tested the feasibility and comparative effectiveness of a virtual world versus a face-to-face diabetes self-management group intervention. Methods: We recruited African American women with type 2 diabetes to participate in an 8-week diabetes self-management program adapted from Power to Prevent, a behavior-change in-person group program for African Americans with diabetes or pre-diabetes. The program is social cognitive theory-guided, evidence-based, and culturally tailored. Participants were randomized to participate in the program via virtual world (Second Life) or face-to-face, both delivered by a single intervention team. Blinded assessors conducted in-person clinical (HbA1c), behavioral, and psychosocial measurements at baseline and 4-month follow-up.

"A Virtual, Simulated Code White for Undergraduate Nursing Students",Not mental health,"Stephen, T; King, K; Taylor, M; Jackson, M; Hilario, C",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Nurses and nursing students are increasingly vulnerable to workplace violence, both verbal and physical, as health care settings and clients cope with unprecedented challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic. Concurrently, clinical learning opportunities for nursing students have been curtailed by public health restrictions and limited capacity. While virtual simulations have been promoted as an alternative to clinical hours, their effectiveness as an educational intervention on workplace violence has yet to be assessed. Purpose: The authors sought to evaluate a virtual, simulated code white-a set of organized responses to a client, visitor, or staff member exhibiting the potential for violence-involving 4th year undergraduate nursing students, randomly sorted into an intervention group and a control group. Methods: Pre and post test measures of knowledge and attitudes about mental health, workplace violence and virtual simulation were collected, as well as qualitative data from focus groups. Findings: While the sample size (n = 24) was insufficient to detect meaningful differences between the intervention and control groups, descriptive statistics and focus group data revealed significant gaps in participants' knowledge around managing workplace violence. Participants rated the virtual simulation highly for its realism and the opportunity to experience working in a virtual environment, while they felt the preamble and debrief were too short.

A brief assessment of psychosocial functioning of subjects with bipolar I disorder,Not Digital,"Leon, AC; Solomon, DA; Mueller, TI; Endicott, J; Posternak, M; Judd, LL; Schettler, PJ; Akiskal, HS; Keller, MB",JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE,2000,"Those afflicted with bipolar disorder often suffer from substantial functional impairment both when in episode and when in remission. This study examined the psychometric properties of a brief assessment of psychosocial functioning, the Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT), among subjects with bipolar I disorder. The study sample consisted of 163 subjects who presented with bipolar I disorder at intake into the NIMH Collaborative Depression Study (CDS). All LIFE-RIFT items come from the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE). Follow-up data that were used to examine the reliability and validity of the scale come from assessments of psychosocial functioning that were conducted 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after intake into the CDS. The results of factor analyses indicate that the scale items are measures of one construct, psychosocial functioning. The interrater agreement on the scale score was very good with an intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.94. The internal consistency reliability among the scale items was uniformly satisfactory over the four assessment periods, with coefficient alpha ranging from 0.78 to 0.84. Mixed-effect regression analyses showed that during mood episodes subjects were significantly more impaired than those in recovery. In conclusion, the psychometric properties of the LIFE-RIFT were examined in subjects with bipolar I disorder. The analyses from this longitudinal, observational study provide empirical support for the reliability and validity of the scale. The LIFE-RIFT provides a brief, inexpensive alternative to scales currently used to assess psychosocial functioning and can be easily added to semistructured assessments that are used in clinical and treatment outcome studies.",10.1097/00005053-200012000-00003,wos,Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1097/00005053-200012000-00003)
A broad v. focused digital intervention for recurrent binge eating: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial,Not Multi User,"Linardon, J; Shatte, A; McClure, Z; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, M",PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,2023,"Background Empirically validated digital interventions for recurrent binge eating typically target numerous hypothesized change mechanisms via the delivery of different modules, skills, and techniques. Emerging evidence suggests that interventions designed to target and isolate one key change mechanism may also produce meaningful change in core symptoms. Although both 'broad' and 'focused' digital programs have demonstrated efficacy, no study has performed a direct, head-to-head comparison of the two approaches. We addressed this through a randomized non-inferiority trial. Method Participants with recurrent binge eating were randomly assigned to a broad (n = 199) or focused digital intervention (n = 199), or a waitlist (n = 202). The broad program targeted dietary restraint, mood intolerance, and body image disturbances, while the focused program exclusively targeted dietary restraint. Primary outcomes were eating disorder psychopathology and binge eating frequency. Results In intention-to-treat analyses, both intervention groups reported greater improvements in primary and secondary outcomes than the waitlist, which were sustained at an 8-week follow-up. The focused intervention was not inferior to the broad intervention on all but one outcome, but was associated with higher rates of attrition and non-compliance. Conclusion Focused digital interventions that are designed to target one key change mechanism may produce comparable symptom improvements to broader digital interventions, but appear to be associated with lower engagement.",10.1017/S0033291722001477,wos,Psychology; Psychiatry,Binge eating; bulimia nervosa; digital intervention; eating disorders; e-health; randomized trial; smartphone app,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722001477)
A chatbot-based intervention with ELME to improve stress and health-related parameters in a stressed sample: Study protocol of a randomised controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Schillings, C; Meissner, D; Erb, B; Schultchen, D; Bendig, E; Pollatos, O",FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH,2023,"BackgroundStress levels in the general population had already been increasing in recent years, and have subsequently been exacerbated by the global pandemic. One approach for innovative online-based interventions are chatbots - computer programs that can simulate a text-based interaction with human users via a conversational interface. Research on the efficacy of chatbot-based interventions in the context of mental health is sparse. The present study is designed to investigate the effects of a three-week chatbot-based intervention with the chatbot ELME, aiming to reduce stress and to improve various health-related parameters in a stressed sample.MethodsIn this multicenter, two-armed randomised controlled trial with a parallel design, a three-week chatbot-based intervention group including two daily interactive intervention sessions via smartphone (a 10-20 min.) is compared to a treatment-as-usual control group. A total of 130 adult participants with a medium to high stress levels will be recruited in Germany. Assessments will take place pre-intervention, post-intervention (after three weeks), and follow-up (after six weeks). The primary outcome is perceived stress. Secondary outcomes include self-reported interoceptive accuracy, mindfulness, anxiety, depression, personality, emotion regulation, psychological well-being, stress mindset, intervention credibility and expectancies, affinity for technology, and attitudes towards artificial intelligence. During the intervention, participants undergo ecological momentary assessments. Furthermore, satisfaction with the intervention, the usability of the chatbot, potential negative effects of the intervention, adherence, potential dropout reasons, and open feedback questions regarding the chatbot are assessed post-intervention.DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first chatbot-based intervention addressing interoception, as well as in the context with the target variables stress and mindfulness. The design of the present study and the usability of the chatbot were successfully tested in a previous feasibility study. To counteract a low adherence of the chatbot-based intervention, a high guidance by the chatbot, short sessions, individual and flexible time points of the intervention units and the ecological momentary assessments, reminder messages, and the opportunity to postpone single units were implemented.",10.3389/fdgth.2023.1046202,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,chatbot; intervention; stress; interoception; mindfulness; digital health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1046202)
A cluster randomized controlled trial comparing Virtual Learning Collaborative and Technical Assistance strategies to implement an early palliative care program for patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers: a study protocol,Other,"Zubkoff, L; Lyons, KD; Dionne-Odom, JN; Hagley, G; Pisu, M; Azuero, A; Flannery, M; Taylor, R; Carpenter-Song, E; Mohile, S; Bakitas, MA",IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE,2021,"BackgroundVirtual Learning Collaboratives (VLC), learning communities focused on a common purpose, are used frequently in healthcare settings to implement best practices. Yet, there is limited research testing the effectiveness of this approach compared to other implementation strategies. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a VLC compared to Technical Assistance (TA) among community oncology practices implementing ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends), an evidence-based, early palliative care telehealth, psycho-educational intervention for patients with newly diagnosed advanced cancer and their caregivers.MethodsUsing Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) and Proctor's Implementation Outcomes Frameworks, this two-arm hybrid type-III cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare two implementation strategies, VLC versus TA, among the 48 National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) practice clusters that have not historically provided palliative care to all patients with advanced cancer. Three cohorts of practice clusters will be randomized to the study arms. Each practice cluster will recruit 15-27 patients and a family caregiver to participate in ENABLE. The primary study outcome is ENABLE uptake (patient level), i.e., the proportion of eligible patients who complete the ENABLE program (receive a palliative care assessment and complete the six ENABLE sessions over 12weeks). The secondary outcome is overall program implementation (practice cluster level), as measured by the General Organizational Index at baseline, 6, and 12months. Exploratory aims assess patient and caregiver mood and quality of life outcomes at baseline, 12, and 24weeks. Practice cluster randomization will seek to keep the proportion of rural practices, practice sizes, and minority patients seen within each practice balanced across the two study arms.DiscussionThis study will advance the field of implementation science by evaluating VLC effectiveness, a commonly used but understudied, implementation strategy.

Severe acute and chronic pain are the most common complications of sickle cell disease (SCD). Pain results in disability, psychosocial distress, repeated clinic visits/hospitalizations, and significant healthcare costs. Psychosocial pain interventions that teach cognitive and behavioral strategies for managing pain have been effective in other adolescent populations when delivered in person or through digital technologies. Our aim was to conduct a multisite, randomized, controlled trial to improve pain and coping in youth aged 12 to 18 years with SCD using a digital cognitive-behavioral therapy program (iCanCope with Sickle Cell Disease; iCC-SCD) vs Education control. We enrolled 137 participants (ages 12-18 years, 59% female) and analyzed 111 adolescents (107 caregivers), 54 randomized to Education control and 57 randomized to iCC-SCD. Ninety-two percent of youth completed posttreatment assessments and 88% completed 6-month follow-up.

A collective autoethnography of coproduction in mental health research by academic researchers and young people in Brazil,Other,"Siston, FR; Murta, SG; Mendes, JAD; Ferreira, JA; Santos, VHD; Seabra, BTR; de Souza, RRA; da Cunha, RD; Pavarini, G",BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH,2023,"Introduction Coproduction of mental health research and interventions involving researchers and young people is increasingly common. However, this model raises challenges, related, for instance, to communication, power and control. This paper narrates-from a collective first-person perspective-the lived experience of coproduction of a digital intervention by institutional researchers and young citizen researchers in Brazil. Method This study employed a collaborative autoethnographic methodology, utilising autobiographical data such as meeting recordings, individual notes and collective guided reflections on the coproduction process. Our analysis focused on challenges and solutions that arose during the process. Results Throughout the project, we created formal and informal mechanisms for accountability, transparency and fair inclusion of multiple voices. We engaged in mutual capacity-building, invested in building interpersonal knowledge, and implemented practices to reduce overload and promote equitable participation. Through ongoing reflection and readjustment in response to challenges, we progressively embraced more democratic and egalitarian values. The collective care invested in the process fostered synergy, trust, and intergroup friendship. Conclusion Our experience points to the value of creating a space for multiple research identities: the citizen young person and the institutional researcher, both of whom critically reflect on their roles in the research process. Our focus on coproduced care calls into question participation metaphors that represent the process via a single axis-young people-who linearly progress from minimal participation to full autonomy.

Our aim was to assess the impact of 12 months of telephone collaborative care (tCC) versus enhanced usual care (eUC) on depression and drinking.Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the Primary care Assessment and Research of a Telephone intervention for Neuropsychiatric conditions with Education and Resources study (PARTNERs), a blinded randomized controlled trial. We examined 144 participants with comorbid depression and at-risk drinking, of which 129 were from the original sample whose data have been published, and 15 were studied since the original report had been published. PARTNERs compared eUC consisting of usual care plus assessment of symptoms at baseline, and 4, 8, and 12 months later vs. tCC consisting of eUC plus telephone-based coaching and symptom monitoring provided by a lay mental health technician to patients supervised by a psychiatrist. The study assessed depression response and remission using logistic regression; we assessed trajectory of drinking using Generalized-estimating equations (GEE). Baseline factors associated with likelihood of not exceeding number of drinks at 12 months were identified using decision trees.Results: tCC produced a faster decline in the number of drinks than eUC (Wald Chi(2) = 9.47, p = 0.02). However, drinking and depression outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups at the end of treatment. Higher alcohol consumption at baseline (>= 18 standard drinks per week in the tCC group and >= 11 standard drinks per week in the eUC group) was associated with a higher likelihood of having at-risk drinking after 12 months of treatment.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, compared to eUC, tCC may accelerate drinking reductions in patients with comorbid depression and at-risk drinking.

A conceptual framework for mobile-based cyberbullying-related youth suicide risk screening and intervention,Other,"Kim, S",JOURNAL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT,2024,"The prevalence of cyberbullying and related suicide rate increases among youth demand a proactive and systematic response. This paper proposes a mobile-based Framework for Youth Suicide Screening and intervention (YSSI) to address the issue of youth suicide within the cyber environment. It draws on Vygotsky's sociocultural theory to understand the developmental stages of youth and employs Durkheim's concept of anomic suicide to frame suicide due to cyberbullying as a social fact that extends beyond individual problems. Additionally, the framework invokes Friedrich Engels' concept of social murder to highlight the urgent social responsibility of preventing youth suicide. The YSSI framework is designed for early detection and intervention, with mobile technology as a primary tool. It encompasses four stages: Stage 1 (Warning Signs), Stage 2 (Assessment), Stage 3 (Intervention), and Stage 4 (Follow-up). This framework emphasizes the critical role of community and family engagement in addressing youth suicide in the digital era. This engagement aims to provide support and guidance to youth, thereby strengthening their resilience to adversity associated with cyberbullying. In alignment with the objectives of the Grand Challenge for Social Work Initiative (GCSWI), the YSSI framework is dedicated to mitigating the negative effects of cyberbullying through collaborative social engagement and fostering a critical discourse on youth mental health and cyber well-being.",10.1080/10911359.2024.2318447,wos,Social Work,Cyberbullying; youth suicide; mobile interventions; suicide screening and intervention frameworks,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2024.2318447)

A feasibility trial of a digital mindfulness-based intervention to improve asthma-related quality of life for primary care patients with asthma,Not Multi User,"Ainsworth, B; Stanescu, S; Stuart, B; Russell, D; Liddiard, M; Djukanovic, R; Thomas, M",JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,2022,"Asthma outcomes remain suboptimal, despite effective pharmacotherapy. Psychological dysfunction (such as anxiety) is common, and associated with poorer outcomes. We evaluated a digital mindfulness programme as an intervention to improve asthma-related quality of life for primary care patients, in a prospectively registered randomized-controlled feasibility study. We offered 'Headspace', a widely-used digital mindfulness intervention, to adults with asthma through 16 UK GP practices. Participants were randomized on a 2:1 basis to the mindfulness intervention, or waitlist control. Participants completed questionnaires (including asthma symptom control, asthma-related quality of life, anxiety, depression) at baseline, 6-week and 3-month follow-up. 116 participants completed primary outcomes at 3-month follow-up: intervention 73 (79%), control 43 (84%). Compared to baseline, the intervention group but not the control group reported significantly improved asthma-related quality of life, with a between-group difference favoring the intervention group that was not significant (Mean difference = 0.15, 95%CI - 0.13 to 0.42). Intervention use varied (ranging from 0 to 192 times) but was generally high. Digital mindfulness interventions are feasible and acceptable adjunct treatments for mild and moderate asthma to target quality of life. Further research should adapt 'generic' mindfulness-based stress-reduction to maximize effectiveness for asthma, and validate our findings in a fully-powered randomized controlled trial.

A field is to play. Enacting mental images of the soundscape,Not Multi User,"Patelli, P",EMOTION SPACE AND SOCIETY,2017,"The article mainly focuses on the presentation of A field is to play, a collaborative and interactive installation dedicated to the recording and the reenacting of the relationship between the inhabitants of Mazama, WA - a small community in the USA - and their sonic environment. Through multimedia local interactions, enaction and emplacement, the project aimed to give expression to the many, individual and socially constructed, mental images of the local soundscape. A physical, interactive audio installation presented excerpts from individual interviews, emplacing and activating such mental representations, to merge them back into the environment. The artistic intervention was conceived as a localised process, acting through an engagement with publics. The soundscape itself, and its mental representations, were manipulated both as relational media, and subject matter. The presentation is preceded by three sections that introduce the theoretical context at the origin of the installation starting from urban theory in architecture, to the role of public art up to the discussion around the topic of soundscape, in a path from the most general issues to those more related to the specific character of the installation. The conclusion pulls together the theoretical and the applied sections and offers some response to the questions raised in the introduction. Through a theoretical engagement with the installation, it asks the reader to rethink the relationship between sound, memory and mental images. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A group- and smartphone-based psychological intervention to increase and maintain physical activity in patients with musculoskeletal conditions: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (MoVo-App),Not mental health,"Lin, JX; Wurst, R; Paganini, S; Hohberg, V; Kinkel, S; Göhner, W; Ramsenthaler, C; Fuchs, R",TRIALS,2020,"BackgroundInterventions designed to increase the level of physical activity are crucial in the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions. The psychological group-based intervention MoVo-LISA based on the Motivation-Volition (MoVo) Process Model has been shown to effectively promote physical activity. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a MoVo-based app (MoVo-App) subsequent to MoVo-LISA during orthopedic inpatient care can support people to increase and maintain their amount of physical activity.Methods/designIn this parallel-group randomized controlled trial, patients with musculoskeletal disorders will be randomized to either (a) a combination of the group-based intervention program MoVo-LISA to promote physical activity plus the MoVo-App or (b) the group-based intervention program alone without the app. The intervention group will receive the MoVo-App after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. They receive help to increase and maintain their level of physical activity (initiated by the group program) by tracking their health goals, activity plans, major barriers, and barrier management that were developed during the group-based program. We will recruit 224 initially minimally active participants during orthopedic rehabilitation care. Outcomes are assessed at clinic admission; discharge; 6 weeks; and 3 (post-treatment), 6, and 12 months after discharge (follow-up). The primary outcome is sport activity (active/inactive and minutes of activity) at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are movement activity, cognitive mediators of behavioral change (e.g., self-efficacy, action planning), and health-related variables (e.g., pain intensity, depression). To evaluate intervention effects, linear mixed effects models (both on intention-to-treat basis with an additional per-protocol analysis) will be conducted with each outcome variable and with time as the within-subjects factor and group as the between-subjects factor, along with all two-way interactions and accounting for covariates as fixed effects.DiscussionThis is the first evaluation of the effectiveness of an app in combination with a face-to-face group intervention to promote physical activity.

A holistic approach to preventing type 2 diabetes in Asian women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus: a feasibility study and pilot randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Liew, SJ; Soon, CS; Chooi, YC; Tint, MT; Eriksson, JG",FRONTIERS IN CLINICAL DIABETES AND HEALTHCARE,2023,"Background Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) exposes women to future risk of Type 2 Diabetes. Previous studies focused on diet and physical activity, less emphasis was given to tackle intertwined risk factors such as sleep and stress. Knowledge remains scarce in multi-ethnic Asian communities. This study explored the: (1) feasibility of a holistic digital intervention on improving diet, physical activity (PA), sleep and stress of Asian women with a history of GDM, and (2) preliminary efficacy of the holistic intervention on women's physical and mental well-being via a pilot randomized controlled trial.Methods Female volunteers with a history of GDM but without pre-existing diabetes were recruited from multi-ethnic Singaporean community. Each eligible woman was given a self-monitoring opportunity using Oura Ring that provided daily feedback on step counts, PA, sleep and bedtime heart rate. Intervention group additionally received personalized recommendations aimed to reinforce healthy behaviors holistically (diet, PA, sleep and stress). Dietary intake was evaluated by a research dietitian, while step counts, PA, sleep and bedtime heart rate were evaluated by health coaches based on Oura Ring data. Perceived physical and mental health and well-being were self-reported. Clinical outcomes included glycemic status determined by HbA1c and OGTT tests, body mass index, blood pressures and lipid profile.Results Of 196 women from the community, 72 women completed diabetes screening, 61 women were eligible and 56 women completed the study. The 56 completers had mean age of 35.8 +/- 3.7 years, predominantly Chinese, majority had their first GDM diagnosed at least 2 years ago and had two GDM-affected pregnancies. After intervention period, more women in the Intervention group achieved at least 8,000 steps/day and had at least 6 hours of sleep per night. Noticeable reduction of added sugar in their food and beverages were observed after the dietary intervention. Changes in body weight and mental well-being were observed but group differences were not statistically significant.Conclusions The holistic approach appeared feasible for personalizing lifestyle recommendations to promote physical and mental well-being among women with a history of GDM.

We assessed the feasibility of a protocol and procedures for the Recovery-focused Community support to Avoid readmissions and improve Participation after Stroke (ReCAPS) trial. Methods We conducted a mixed-method feasibility study. Participants with acute stroke were recruited from three hospitals (Melbourne, Australia). Eligibility: Adults with stroke discharged from hospital to home within 10 days, modified Rankin Score 0-4 and prior use of Short Message System (SMS)/email. While in hospital, recruited participants contributed to structured person-centred goal setting and completed baseline surveys including self-management skills and health-related quality of life. Participants were randomised 7-14 days after discharge via REDCap (R) (1:1 allocation). Following randomisation, the intervention group received a 12-week programme of personalised electronic support messages (average 66 messages sent by SMS or email) aligned with their goals. The control group received six electronic administrative messages. Feasibility outcomes included the following: number of patients screened and recruited, study retainment, completion of outcome measures and acceptability of the ReCAPS intervention and trial procedures (e.g. participant satisfaction survey, clinician interviews). Protocol fidelity outcomes included number of goals developed (and quality), electronic messages delivered, stop messages received and engagement with messages. We undertook inductive thematic analysis of interview/open-text survey data and descriptive analysis of closed survey questions. Results Between November 2018 and October 2019, 312 patients were screened; 37/105 (35%) eligible patients provided consent (mean age 61 years; 32% female); 33 were randomised (17 to intervention). Overall, 29 (88%) participants completed the12-week outcome assessments with 12 (41%) completed assessments in the allocated timeframe and 16 also completing the satisfaction survey (intervention=10).

A mobile application of breast cancer e-support program versus routine Care in the treatment of Chinese women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Good,"Zhu, JM; Ebert, L; Liu, XY; Chan, SWC",BMC CANCER,2017,"Background: Women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy suffer from a number of symptoms and report receiving inadequate support from health care professionals. Innovative and easily accessible interventions are lacking. Breast Cancer e-Support is a mobile Application program (App) that provides patients with individually tailored information and a support group of peers and health care professionals. Breast Cancer e-Support aims to promote women's self-efficacy, social support and symptom management, thus improving their quality of life and psychological well-being. Methods: A single-blinded, multi-centre, randomised, 6-month, parallel-group superiority design will be used. Based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory and the social exchange theory, Breast Cancer e-Support has four modules: 1) a Learning forum; 2) a Discussion forum; 3) an Ask-the-Expert forum; and 4) a Personal Stories forum. Women with breast cancer (n = 108) who are commencing chemotherapy will be recruited from two university-affiliated hospitals in China. They will be randomly assigned to either control group that receives routine care or intervention group that receives routine care plus access to Breast Cancer e-Support program during their four cycles of chemotherapy. Self-efficacy, social support, symptom distress, quality of life, and anxiety and depression will be measured at baseline, then one week and 12 weeks post-intervention. Discussion: This is the first study of its kind in China to evaluate the use of a mobile application intervention with a rigorous research design and theoretical framework. This study will contribute to evidence regarding the effectiveness of a theory-based mobile application to support women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.

This study investigated the effectiveness and perceived underlying mechanisms of the mobile health (mHealth) intervention #LIFEGOALS to promote healthy lifestyles and mental health. #LIFEGOALS is an evidence-based app with activity tracker, including self-regulation techniques, gamification elements, a support chatbot, and health narrative videos.Methods A quasi-randomized controlled trial (N = 279) with 12-week intervention period and process evaluation interviews (n = 13) took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents (12-15y) from the general population were allocated at school-level to the intervention (n = 184) or to a no-intervention group (n = 95). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), psychological well-being, mood, self-perception, peer support, resilience, depressed feelings, sleep quality and breakfast frequency were assessed via a web-based survey; physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep routine via Axivity accelerometers. Multilevel generalized linear models were fitted to investigate intervention effects and moderation by pandemic-related measures. Interviews were coded using thematic analysis.Results Non-usage attrition was high: 18% of the participants in the intervention group never used the app. An additional 30% stopped usage by the second week. Beneficial intervention effects were found for physical activity (chi(2)(1) = 4.36, P = .04), sedentary behavior (chi(2)(1) = 6.44, P = .01), sleep quality (chi(2)(1) = 6.11, P = .01), and mood (chi(2)(1) = 2.30, P = .02). However, effects on activity-related behavior were only present for adolescents having normal sports access, and effects on mood only for adolescents with full in-school education. HRQoL (chi(2)(2) = 14.72, P < .001), mood (chi(2)(1) = 6.03, P = .01), and peer support (chi(2)(1) = 13.69, P < .001) worsened in adolescents with pandemic-induced remote-education. Interviewees reported that the reward system, self-regulation guidance, and increased health awareness had contributed to their behavior change. They also pointed to the importance of social factors, quality of technology and autonomy for mHealth effectiveness.Conclusions #LIFEGOALS showed mixed results on health behaviors and mental health.

A modeling-based narrative intervention to promote timely care-seeking in patients with acute myocardial infarction: A pilot randomized controlled trial and feasibility analysis,Not mental health,"Li, PWC; Yu, DSF",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING,2019,"Background: Prolonged delay in seeking medical attention for acute myocardial infarction persists as a global phenomenon, which limits effective disease management. The effects of previous mass-media campaigns and psycho-educations have been minimal. Aims: This study aimed to develop a modeling-based narrative intervention, and to examine its feasibility and preliminary effects on care-seeking behavioral intention in Chinese acute myocardial infarction patients. Methods: The modeling-based narrative intervention was developed by integrating updated research evidence and participants' perspectives. Ten patients were invited to co-design the intervention. The narrative approach was adopted to engage patients in a mental rehearsal of the decision-making process through a virtual acute myocardial infarction attack experience. A pilot randomized controlled trial was adopted to examine the feasibility and preliminary effects of this intervention. Results: A total of 67 participants were randomly allocated to receive either the modeling-based narrative intervention (n=34) or didactic education (n=33). The intervention was feasible and well-accepted by the participants as evidenced by high attendance and participant satisfaction. They considered the intervention as informative and interesting. The majority of the participants in the intervention group expressed that they enjoyed the intervention. Although the preliminary data showed non-significant between-group differences, a more prominent improving trend for acute myocardial infarction knowledge, care-seeking attitudes and beliefs in the intervention group were evident.

A multi-component universal intervention to improve diet and physical activity among adults with intellectual disabilities in community residences: A cluster randomised controlled trial,Not mental health,"Bergström, H; Hagströmer, M; Hogberg, J; Elinder, LS",RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES,2013,"People with ID have an increased risk for unhealthy diets, physical inactivity and weight disturbances. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effectiveness of a novel and complex intervention to improve diet and physical activity, targeting both caregivers and residents, in community residences for people with ID. A three component intervention based on Social Cognitive Theory was developed, including: (1) appointment of a health ambassador in each community residence attending network meetings, (2) a study circle for caregivers, and (3) a health course for the residents. The intervention lasted for 12-16 months and allowed for some local tailoring. A cluster randomised controlled trial, randomised at residence level, was conducted to evaluate the effects of the intervention. Thirty community residences for people with mild or moderate ID in Stockholm County, Sweden, were included. A total of 130 participants, 74 women and 56 men aged 20-66 years, entered, and 129 participants completed the study. The primary outcome was physical activity, measured by pedometry. Secondary outcomes were BMI, waist circumference, dietary quality measured by digital photography, satisfaction with life assessed with a scale, and work routines assessed with a questionnaire. Outcomes were related to intervention fidelity. A positive intervention effect was found on physical activity, with an average increase of 1608 steps/day among participants in the intervention group (P = 0.045). The effect size was 0.29 (Cohen's d). The type of residence was found to be an effect moderator. A positive intervention effect was found as well on work routines, with an average increase of 7.1 percentage points on a self-assessment scale among residences in the intervention group (P = 0.016). No significant effects were found on BMI, waist circumference, dietary quality, or satisfaction with life. In conclusion, this innovative intervention was effective in improving physical activity and work routines. It is likely that even greater effects could be achieved by improvements in implementation strategies, leading to higher fidelity. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

There was also a significant improvement in the intervention condition on the help-seeking intention for emotional problems at 1-month (mean difference = 0.17, 95% CI [0.05, 0.28], p = 0.013) and 3-month follow-ups (mean difference = 0.16, 95% CI [0.04, 0.27], p = 0.022) compared with the control group. Participants' depression and anxiety literacy and help-seeking encouragement related knowledge in intervention conditions showed significant improvements. There were no significant improvements in actual help-seeking behaviors, self-stigma toward seeking professional assistance, depression, and anxiety symptoms. No adverse events or side effects were observed. However, the follow-up time point was limited to 3 months which might not be long enough for drastic mindset and behavioral changes in help-seeking to occur.Conclusions The current intervention was an effective approach in promoting help-seeking intentions, mental health literacy, and help-seeking encouragement-related knowledge.

A novel digital health intervention to improve patient engagement to stimulants in adult ADHD in the primary care setting: Preliminary findings from an open label study,Other,"Biederman, J; Fried, R; DiSalvo, M; Driscoll, H; Green, A; Biederman, I; Woodworth, KY; Faraone, SV",PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH,2020,"Aims: We piloted the effectiveness and acceptability of a novel text messaging-based (SMS) digital health intervention aimed at addressing the previously documented poor rate of patient engagement in stimulant treatment in the primary care setting. Methods: 117 adults ages 18-55 from primary care and psychiatric practices who were prescribed a stimulant medication for ADHD treatment received the SMS intervention. Comparators were age-, race-, and sex-matched patients from the same health care organization's electronic medical record who had been prescribed stimulant medications over a similar time period. Using documented prescription records, we determined whether patients had timely prescription refills. Results: Ninety-six percent (N = 112) of participants completed our a priori metric of patient engagement consisting of 37 days of the SMS program. Eighty-one percent of participants refilled their index prescriptions in a timely manner compared to only 36% of patients receiving treatment as usual (OR=7.54, 95% CI: 4.46, 12.77; p<0.001). We found no significant interaction between prescribing source (non-psychiatry vs. psychiatry) and intervention group (SMS vs. treatment as usual).

A novel interactive mobile health support system for pediatric obesity treatment: a randomized controlled feasibility trial,Not mental health,"Johansson, L; Hagman, E; Danielsson, P",BMC PEDIATRICS,2020,"Background: In order to achieve improved weight status, behavioral pediatric obesity treatment is resource intensive. Mobile Health (mHealth) is more accessible than standard care but effective approaches are scarce. Therefore, the aim of this feasibility trial was to study trial design, mHealth usage, compliance, and acceptability of a novel mHealth approach in pediatric obesity treatment. Methods: This six-month parallel two-arm feasibility trial took place at three pediatric outpatient clinics in Stockholm, Sweden. Participants, 5-12 years, starting obesity treatment were randomized to using an mHealth support system as an addition to standard care (intervention) or to standard care alone (control). The intervention included daily self-monitoring of weight transferred to a mobile application (app) used by parents, a website in which clinicians could track treatment progress, prespecified treatment goals for change in degree of obesity shown in the app and on the website, and text message interactions between clinicians and parents. The main outcome was description of feasibility. Height and weight were measured at baseline, three, and 6 months to explore changes in body mass index standard deviation score (BMI SDS). Results: Of 40 children eligible for inclusion, 28 agreed to participate (54% girls) and were randomized to intervention (n = 15) or control (n = 13). Weight was measured at home regularly throughout the entire trial period by 12/15 children in the intervention group. Attendance at appointments were better in the intervention group (p = 0.024). Both parents and clinicians had a positive experience and found the mHealth support system accessible. At 6 months the intervention group had a greater reduction of 0.24 units in BMI SDS than standard care (- 0.23 vs. 0.01, p = 0.002). Conclusions: The mHealth support system was a feasible and innovative treatment approach which, in addition to standard care, generated better treatment results than standard care alone.

A personalized app to improve quality of life of patients with a stoma: A protocol for a multicentre randomized controlled trial,Not mental health,"van der Storm, SL; Bemelman, WA; van Dieren, S; Schijven, MP",COLORECTAL DISEASE,2023,"Aim: Proper education, guidance and support is crucial before and following creation of a stoma. Patients with a stoma and their close relatives need to adapt to and cope with this new - and sometimes unforeseen - situation, which may result in insecurities and a variety of psychosocial problems. Self-efficacy is associated both with a reduction in psychosocial problems and with improved quality of life. The main objective of this study was to investigate whether self-reported quality of life of patients with a stoma can be enhanced by offering personalized and timed guidance, as well as peer contact, in a patient-centred mobile application.Method: A multicentre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Consented adults >18 years of age who will receive an ileostomy or colostomy and possess an eligible smartphone will be included. The intervention group will be given the full version of the application (containing personalized and timed guidance, such as operation-specific information and information on the associated care pathway) to install on their smartphone. In addition, the intervention group has access to a protected peer-support platform within the app. The control group will receive a restricted version of the application that contains only generic (non-personalized) stoma-related information. The primary outcome is quality of life, 3 months postoperatively. Secondary outcomes are Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), such as psychological adaption, as well as number of complications, re-admission and re-operation rates and the length of hospital stay.Results: Patient enrolment began in March 2021. Data collection was not complete when this protocol was submitted.Conclusion: We hypothesize that patients with a stoma who are supported by the intervention version of the app will report a significantly higher quality of life than patients with a stoma who are supported by the control version of the app (ie, are not offered personalized and timed guidance and information and do not have access to peer support in the app).",10.1111/codi.16694,"pubmed, wos",Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery,app; colorectal; colostomy; digital; ehealth; ileostomy; mhealth; mobile application; mobile health; quality of life; stoma; surgery,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1111/codi.16694)

The e-predictD study aims to design, develop, and evaluate an evolved predictD intervention to prevent the onset of major depression in primary care based on Information and Communication Technologies, predictive risk algorithms, decision support systems (DSSs), and personalized prevention plans (PPPs). A multicenter cluster randomized trial with GPs randomly assigned to the e-predictD intervention + care-as-usual (CAU) group or the active-control + CAU group and 1-year follow-up is being conducted. The required sample size is 720 non-depressed patients (aged 18-55 years), with moderate-to-high depression risk, under the care of 72 GPs in six Spanish cities. The GPs assigned to the e-predictD-intervention group receive brief training, and those assigned to the control group do not. Recruited patients of the GPs allocated to the e-predictD group download the e-predictD app, which incorporates validated risk algorithms to predict depression, monitoring systems, and DSSs. Integrating all inputs, the DSS automatically proposes to the patients a PPP for depression based on eight intervention modules: physical exercise, social relationships, improving sleep, problem-solving, communication skills, decision-making, assertiveness, and working with thoughts. This PPP is discussed in a 15-min semi-structured GP-patient interview. Patients then choose one or more of the intervention modules proposed by the DSS to be self-implemented over the next 3 months. This process will be reformulated at 3, 6, and 9 months but without the GP-patient interview. Recruited patients of the GPs allocated to the control-group+CAU download another version of the e-predictD app, but the only intervention that they receive via the app is weekly brief psychoeducational messages (active-control group).

A pilot RCT of virtual reality job interview training in transition-age youth on the autism spectrum,Not Multi User,"Genova, HM; Lancaster, K; Morecraft, J; Haas, M; Edwards, A; DiBenedetto, M; Krch, D; DeLuca, J; Smith, MJ",RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS,2021,"Background: Adolescents on the autism spectrum may have difficulty obtaining and maintaining employment. One particular obstacle for adolescents on the autism spectrum is the job interview. The purpose of the current pilot randomized controlled trial is to examine the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of a virtual reality job interview tool (VR-JIT) in improving job interview performance in adolescents on the autism spectrum. Method: The study was implemented in a high school setting. Fourteen adolescents on the autism spectrum were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group (n = 7) and a services as usual (SAU) control group (n = 7). The intervention group received 10 h of VR-JIT, which in-cludes interviewing with a virtual human and receiving feedback. All participants performed a video-recorded mock job interview at pre-test and post-test, which was rated by blinded assessors to track interview skills. Students filled out questionnaires related to job interviewing anxiety and self-efficacy pre-and post-intervention. Feasibility metrics were recorded as well. Results: Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed improved a metric of job interview performance in the experimental group following the intervention compared to the control group, indicated by medium to large effect sizes. However, perceptions of anxiety and self-efficacy did not improve following the intervention. Students reported that the intervention was easy to use and enjoyable. Conclusions: The current pilot study indicates preliminary evidence of the VR-JIT's effectiveness in improving measures of job interview performance in adolescents on the autism spectrum, even though their own perceptions did not improve. Importantly, the VR-JIT intervention was implemented in a school setting, demonstrating feasibility in its adoption as part of curriculum to help improve employment outcomes in transition age youth on the autism spectrum.",10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101878,wos,Education & Educational Research; Psychology; Psychiatry; Rehabilitation,Autism; Transition age youth; Adolescents; Job interview; Virtual reality; RCT,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101878)

A pilot randomized controlled trial of virtual reality delivered relaxation for chronic low back pain,Not mental health,"Rothbaum, AO; Tannenbaum, LR; Zimand, E; Rothbaum, BO",VIRTUAL REALITY,2023,"Chronic lower back pain (CLBP) is a widespread health problem with lifetime incidence up to 80% in the U.S. Conventional treatments, such as surgery and pharmacotherapy have limitations in that they primarily target physical aspects of pain, and certain medications run the risk of abuse, tolerance, sedation, and possible overdose. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is a validated technique that is neither invasive nor with impairing side effects. The effects and reach of PMR may be enhanced using technological advances, such as virtual reality (VR), which is piloted for feasibility in the current project. This study presents a randomized controlled trial investigating the usability and efficacy of a VR-based PMR program. Participants (n = 18) were randomly assigned to the VR treatment or waitlist control group. Treatment participants completed five VR-PMR sessions. Results indicated the novel VR program was highly usable and immersive. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment measures indicated that VR participants reported significantly lower pain levels and improvements in pain-related beliefs compared to controls. Additionally, those who received VR-PMR reported significantly lower state anxiety at the conclusion of the study. Improvements in medication-related beliefs were also found post-treatment. This controlled trial provides preliminary support for a novel, immersive VR relaxation modality as a promising new adjunctive or alternative approach for CLBP management. Future studies can further validate the use of VR, specifically VR-based PMR, for management and treatment of chronic pain. With increased accessibility of consumer VR headsets, a program such as this may improve pain management outside of the medical setting.",10.1007/s10055-023-00760-9,wos,Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Virtual reality; Chronic pain; Back pain; Progressive muscle relaxation; Cognitive behavior therapy; Relaxation,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10055-023-00760-9)

However, barriers often prevent older individuals from attending support groups. This controlled pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability of an online, real-time, interactive virtual reality (VR) support group for widow(er)s, and assessed the preliminary efficacy of the VR support group for improving psychosocial outcomes and sleep quality compared to an active control grief education website. Thirty widow(er)s (M-age = 67.0, SD = 11.0) participated in an 8-week VR support group or accessed a grief education website. Participants completed self-report measures of depression, grief intensity, grief cognitions, yearning, loneliness, perceived stress and sleep quality at three time points. Participant attrition and self-report indicated that both interventions were feasible and acceptable. Both groups showed significant improvements in grief severity, grief cognitions, yearning, loneliness, perceived stress, and global sleep quality across study time points.

Access to and utilization of mental health care, however, is limited by structural barriers such as specialist availability, time, out-of-pocket costs, and attitudinal barriers including stigma. Innovative solutions like virtual care are rapidly entering the health care domain. The advancement and adoption of virtual care for mental health, however, often occurs in the absence of rigorous evaluation and adequate planning for sustainability and spread. Methods: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a nested comparative effectiveness arm, and concurrent realist process evaluation to examine acceptability, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the Big White Wall (BWW) online platform for mental health self-management and peer support among individuals aged 16 and older who are accessing mental health services in Ontario, Canada. Participants will be randomized to 3 months of BWW or treatment as usual. At the end of the 3 months, participants in the intervention group will have the opportunity to opt-in to an intervention extension arm. Those who opt-in will be randomized to receive an additional 3 months of BWW or no additional intervention.

To explore the problem of delivering a biopsychosocially informed package of care in physical therapy practice a recent randomised control trial (RCT) called 'Mind Your Back' was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined physical and internet-delivered psychological intervention (psychologically informed physical treatments) compared to standard treatment for improving disability and self-efficacy in people with chronic LBP. The results of the trial indicated no difference between the two intervention groups. Although high-quality RCTs are considered gold standard for effectiveness of interventions, qualitative research methods embedded within a process evaluation framework are also used to reveal other issues and important information that help to explain clinical trial results, and to further the field of digital health interventions research. Therefore, within a process evaluation framework, the aim is to explore participants experiences of the interventions received throughout the Mind Your Back trial which led to a null result. Methods In-line with recommendations for a process evaluation this study used in-depth interviews and qualitative thematic analysis with participants of both arms of the trial 5-6 months after study completion. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with twenty-five participants to explore their experiences of taking part in the Mind Your Back trial.

The Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) and Oral Impact on Daily Performance-22 (OIDP-22) instruments were used to assess changes in OHRQoL at baseline, 15-days and 6-month recalls. Linear mixed models were used to estimate between- and within-group differences. Results: All bleaching protocols led to significant improvements in overall OHIP-14 scores at the 6-month recall (p <= 0.037). CB and IOB treatments were associated with more substantial positive impacts on overall scores, psychological discomfort, physical disability (CB only), and psychological disability (CB only) compared to HB (p <= 0.011). Significant enhancements in OIDP-22 scores were observed in the CB and HB groups at the 6-month recall compared to baseline (p <= 0.006), with evidence indicating that these improvements were greater in the CB group compared to the IOB group (p = 0.007). Conclusion: All bleaching treatments demonstrated a positive impact on OHRQoL. However, the positive impact was most consistent across domains and age groups in the CB group. The positive impact was less pronounced in older age groups.",10.1016/j.sdentj.2023.09.010,"pubmed, wos","Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",Whitening; In-office bleaching; Home bleaching; Hydrogen peroxide; Carbamide peroxide; Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL); Oral Health Related-Quality of Life (OHIP-14); Oral impact on daily performance (OIDP),URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sdentj.2023.09.010)
A randomized clinical trial of an eHealth intervention on anxiety in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery,Not mental health,"Nilsson, O; Stenman, M; Letterstål, A; Hultgren, R",BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY,2021,"Background: The potential benefit of eHealth interventions in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is uncertain. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an eHealth intervention on anxiety in patients with AAA undergoing surgery. Methods: A single-centre randomized clinical trial of patients with AAA scheduled for surgical repair was undertaken. The intervention group received an eHealth tool and psychosocial support besides standard care. The control group received standard care. The analysis of treatment effects was performed as intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis. The primary outcome measure was anxiety mean score (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety (HADS)-A). Secondary outcomes measures were HADS Depression and short-form 12-item health survey mean scores. Results: Some 120 participants were randomized. No effect on anxiety mean scores was found in the intention-to-treat analysis (-1.21 versus -0.54, P=0.330). Among those randomized to the intervention, only 30 of 60 participants used the eHealth tool (application (app) users). The app users were younger and had a higher educational level. A decrease in anxiety mean scores was noted in those who used the app in the per protocol analysis (-2.00 versus -0.54, P=0.028). The intervention group stated a lower physical-component health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (-4.32 versus -1.16, P=0.042) but mental-component HRQoL and depressive symptoms were unchanged. Conclusions: Delivery of an eHealth intervention in this RCT did not result in an improvement in anxiety scores in patients awaiting AAA surgery. Uptake of the eHealth tool was low, although it resulted in lower anxiety scores in those participants who actually used it.",10.1093/bjs/znab151,"pubmed, wos",Surgery,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1093/bjs/znab151)
"A randomized controlled trial of a virtual reality based, approach-avoidance training updates program for alcohol use disorder: a study protocol",Other,"Mellentin, AI; Nielsen, AS; Ascone, L; Wirtz, J; Samochowiec, J; Kucharska-Mazur, J; Schadow, F; Lebiecka, Z; Skoneczny, T; Mistarz, N; Bremer, T; Kühn, S",BMC PSYCHIATRY,2020,"Background: The approach-avoidance training program (AATP) has shown preliminary promise as an add-on to standard treatment for alcohol dependence. However, knowledge is lacking as to whether the effectiveness of AATP can be enhanced further when performed in a typical drinking situation. The main aim of this study is to investigate whether approach-avoidance training implemented in a virtual reality bar environment is superior to the classical joystick PC-version of the AATP. Methods: The study will be implemented as a randomized controlled trial. A total of 204consecutively enrolled alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients, recruited from alcohol inpatient clinics in Germany, Poland and Denmark, will be randomized into one of three groups at the start of standard alcohol treatment: group A) stimuli-relevant AATP + treatment as usual (TAU); group B) stimuli-relevant AATP in virtual reality + TAU, and group C) TAU only (control group). Treatment outcomes will be assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Repeated-measures ANOVA will be applied to compare the trajectories of the groups over time on drinking, craving and impulsiveness outcomes. It is hypothesized that the two experimental groups will achieve better treatment outcomes compared to group C and that group B will achieve better outcomes than group A. Discussion: This study is the first trial examining the effectiveness of stimuli-relevant AATP delivered in a VR environment. The use of VR has shown promise in enhancing the effectiveness of other psychological treatments and since AATP has already been shown effective as add-on treatment, it is of interest to investigate whether these effects can be further enhanced by implementing the program in more ecologically valid environments. If proven effective, the AATP-VR can, like the AATP, be implemented easily and cheaply as add-on treatment or continued care to enhance the effectiveness of current evidence-based treatment.",10.1186/s12888-020-02739-1,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,Alcohol use disorder; Approach-avoidance training program; Virtual reality,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02739-1)
A randomized controlled trial of customized adherence enhancement (CAE-E): study protocol for a hybrid effectiveness-implementation project,Other,"Levin, JB; Briggs, F; Blixen, C; Bauer, M; Einstadter, D; Albert, JM; Weise, C; Woods, N; Fuentes-Casiano, E; Cassidy, KA; Rentsch, J; Sarna, K; Sajatovic, M",TRIALS,2022,"Background Mood-stabilizing medications are a cornerstone of treatment for people with bipolar disorder, though approximately half of these individuals are poorly adherent with their medication, leading to negative and even severe health consequences. While a variety of approaches can lead to some improvement in medication adherence, there is no single approach that has superior adherence enhancement and limited data on how these approaches can be implemented in clinical settings. Existing data have shown an increasing need for virtual delivery of care and interactive telemedicine interventions may be effective in improving adherence to long-term medication. Methods Customized adherence enhancement (CAE) is a brief, practical bipolar-specific approach that identifies and targets individual patient adherence barriers for intervention using a flexibly administered modular format that can be delivered via telehealth communications. CAE is comprised of up to four standard treatment modules including Psychoeducation, Communication with Providers, Medication Routines, and Modified Motivational Interviewing. Participants will attend assigned module sessions with an interventionist based on their reasons for non-adherence and will be assessed for adherence, functioning, bipolar symptoms, and health resource use across a 12-month period. Qualitative and quantitative data will also be collected to assess barriers and facilitators to CAE implementation and reach and adoption of CAE among clinicians in the community. Discussion The proposed study addresses the need for practical adherence interventions that are effective, flexible, and designed to adapt to different settings and patients. By focusing on a high-risk, vulnerable group of people with bipolar disorder, and refining an evidence-based approach that will integrate into workflow of public-sector care and community mental health clinics, there is substantial potential for improving bipolar medication adherence and overall health outcomes on a broad level.",10.1186/s13063-022-06517-0,wos,Research & Experimental Medicine,Medication adherence; Bipolar disorder; Manic-depressive disorder; Randomized controlled trial; Telehealth,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-022-06517-0)

Materials and Methods A nonblinded randomized controlled trial was conducted (NCT03984929). Participants at least 18 years old living in Washington Heights/Inwood, New York, were recruited from the community between July 2019 and August 2020 and randomized 1:1 to either the intervention group (localization of MedlinePlus resources customized with community components) or the control group (no localized community components). The primary outcome, patient activation, and secondary outcomes, knowledge, self-efficacy, and behavior change, were collected through surveys at 1-month follow-up. Results Of the 134 participants recruited, 50.7% (n = 68) completed the 1-month follow-up. We found no statistically significant differences in the sociodemographic and baseline characteristics between those who missed the 1-month survey and those who completed it. No significant differences were observed in patient activation at 1-month. However, patient activation among all participants (n = 68) significantly increased (P = .048). Statistically significant improvements were also found in self-efficacy (P < .03). In multivariate analysis, birth country outside the United States and higher self-rated attachment to the community emerged as significant predictors of higher patient activation scores. Discussion While the trial did not detect significant differences between groups, all participants demonstrated increased patient activation scores and improved secondary outcomes. While other factors may have contributed to this increase, our study suggests that access to carefully selected high-quality health information materials delivered digitally in the context of a community may result in improvements comparable to localized content in a hard-to-reach urban Hispanic population.

A randomized single-blind controlled trial of a prototype digital polytherapeutic for tinnitus,Not mental health,"Searchfield, GD; Sanders, PJ",FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY,2022,"Objective: This randomized single-blind controlled trial tested the hypothesis that a prototype digital therapeutic developed to provide goal-based counseling with personalized passive and active game-based sound therapy would provide superior tinnitus outcomes, and similar usability, to a popular passive sound therapy app over a 12 week trial period. Methods: The digital therapeutic consisted of an app for iPhone or Android smartphone, Bluetooth bone conduction headphones, neck pillow speaker, and a cloud-based clinician dashboard to enable messaging and app personalization. The control app was a popular self-help passive sound therapy app called White Noise Lite (WN). The primary outcome measure was clinically meaningful change in Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) between baseline and 12 weeks of therapy. Secondary tinnitus measures were the TFI total score and subscales across sessions, rating scales and the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement in Tinnitus (COSIT). Usability of the US and WN interventions were assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ). Ninety-eight participants who were smartphone app users and had chronic moderate-severe tinnitus (>6 months, TFI score > 40) were enrolled and were randomly allocated to one of the intervention groups. Thirty-one participants in the USL group and 30 in the WN group completed 12 weeks of trial. Results: Mean changes in TFI for the USL group at 6 (16.36, SD 17.96) and 12 weeks (17.83 points, SD 19.87) were clinically meaningful (>13 points reduction), the mean change in WN scores were not clinically meaningful (6 weeks 10.77, SD 18.53; 12 weeks 10.12 points, SD 21.36). A statistically higher proportion of USL participants achieved meaningful TFI change at 6 weeks (55%) and 12 weeks (65%) than the WN group at 6 weeks (33%) and 12 weeks (43%). Mean TFI, rating and COSIT scores favored the US group but were not statistically different from WN. Usability measures were similar for both groups. Conclusions: The USL group demonstrated a higher proportion of responders than the WN group.

During the 21-day period, the treatment group received access to an eHealth platform containing a series of brief video activities (e.g., gratitude tasks, breathing, and relaxation) previously demonstrated in experimental studies to improve body satisfaction. Findings showed greater improvements in body satisfaction at post-intervention for the intervention group than the waitlist controls (Cohen's d = .42). Use of the intervention content was associated with immediate increases in state-like body satisfaction ratings, and the magnitude of these in-the-moment improvements was predictive of greater post-intervention symptom improvement and retention (ps <.05).

Most previous studies, however, implemented in-person trainings containing a mix of different, mostly solitary, practices and focused on pre- to post-training outcomes. In this randomized trial, we explore the immediate differential efficacy of two daily app-delivered practices in shifting emotional (valence, arousal) and thinking patterns (thought content on future-past, self-other, positive-negative dimensions). For 10 weeks of daily training, 212 participants (18-65 years) performed either a novel 12-min partner-based socio-emotional practice (Affect Dyad) or a 12-min attention-focused solitary mindfulness-based practice. Using ordinal Bayesian multilevel modeling, we found that both practice types led to more positive affect and higher arousal. However, whereas mindfulness-based practice partly led to a decrease in active thoughts, particularly in future-, other-related and negative thoughts, the Dyad in contrast led to increases in other-related, and positive thoughts. This shift towards more social and positive thoughts may specifically support overcoming ruminative thinking patterns associated with self-related and negative thought content.

A review of the explainability and safety of conversational agents for mental health to identify avenues for improvement,Not Multi User,"Sarkar, S; Gaur, M; Chen, LK; Garg, M; Srivastava, B",FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,2023,"Virtual Mental Health Assistants (VMHAs) continuously evolve to support the overloaded global healthcare system, which receives approximately 60 million primary care visits and 6 million emergency room visits annually. These systems, developed by clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and AI researchers, are designed to aid in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The main focus of VMHAs is to provide relevant information to mental health professionals (MHPs) and engage in meaningful conversations to support individuals with mental health conditions. However, certain gaps prevent VMHAs from fully delivering on their promise during active communications. One of the gaps is their inability to explain their decisions to patients and MHPs, making conversations less trustworthy. Additionally, VMHAs can be vulnerable in providing unsafe responses to patient queries, further undermining their reliability. In this review, we assess the current state of VMHAs on the grounds of user-level explainability and safety, a set of desired properties for the broader adoption of VMHAs. This includes the examination of ChatGPT, a conversation agent developed on AI-driven models: GPT3.5 and GPT-4, that has been proposed for use in providing mental health services. By harnessing the collaborative and impactful contributions of AI, natural language processing, and the mental health professionals (MHPs) community, the review identifies opportunities for technological progress in VMHAs to ensure their capabilities include explainable and safe behaviors.

A self-guided Internet-based intervention for individuals with chronic pain and depressive symptoms: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Borsutzky, S; Moritz, S; Hottenrott, B; Gehlenborg, J",TRIALS,2023,"BackgroundDespite the existence of evidence-based therapy options for the treatment of chronic pain and comorbid depressive symptoms (e.g., CBT), many individuals remain untreated. Treatment gaps result from a lack of specialists, patient fear of stigmatization, or patient immobility. Internet-based self-help interventions could serve as an anonymous and flexible alternative treatment option. In a pilot study, chronic pain patients with comorbid depressive symptoms who used a generic Internet-based depression program showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (but not pain symptoms) compared to a waitlist control group. Based on these findings, we developed the low-threshold, anonymous, and cost-free Internet-based self-help intervention Lenio that is tailored to the specific needs of chronic pain patients with comorbid depressive symptoms. Lenio is accompanied by the smartphone application (app) COGITO designed to increase therapeutic success. With Lenio and COGITO addressing both chronic pain and depressive symptoms, the trial aims to increase treatment effects of online interventions for chronic pain patients by reducing both depressive symptoms and pain.MethodsThe effectiveness of the Internet-based self-help intervention and accompanying smartphone app will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 300 participants will be randomized into an intervention group (Lenio/COGITO), an active control group (depression-focused smartphone app), or a waitlist control group.

The objective of this study was to assess and report the efficacy of MBST intervention among breast cancer patients for hopelessness, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, oxygen (SpO(2)) intensity, and heart rate-beats per minute (HR-bpm) at an 8-week period. Method: The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, The Emotion Thermometer, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease, and Beck's Hopelessness Scale were used for assessing the intervention's outcome; 149 BC patients were randomly assigned into two groups (equal-mean-age, p = 0.262). The participants in the control group (CG, n = 73) received Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)-Cognitive-Disputation (CBT-CD) for 20 min, and intervention group (1G, n = 76) received MBST intervention. No additional psychological interventions were given between week-1 and week-8.

A smartphone-assisted brief online cognitive-behavioral intervention for pregnant women with depression: a study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Zuccolo, PF; Xavier, MO; Matijasevich, A; Polanczyk, G; Fatori, D",TRIALS,2021,"BackgroundPregnancy is strongly associated with increased risk for depression. Approximately 25% of pregnant women develop depression. Treatment for depression during pregnancy has several complexities: the use of psychiatric medications during pregnancy might result in developmental problems in the child and must be used with caution. Psychosocial interventions are effective, but they require specialized professionals. Low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as Brazil do not have enough mental health professionals needed to meet this demand. In this context, smartphone-based interventions show immense potential. We developed Motherly, a smartphone application (app) designed to treat maternal depression. We aim to test the efficacy of Motherly in addition to brief cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) to treat maternal depression.MethodsWe will conduct a 2-arm parallel-randomized controlled clinical trial in which 70 pregnant women aged between 16 and 40years with depression will be randomized to intervention or active control. The intervention group will have access to Motherly, a smartphone app based on three concepts: psychoeducation, behavior monitoring, and gaming elements. Motherly is composed of a package of interventions composed of modules: mental health, sleep, nutrition, physical activity, social support, prenatal/postnatal support, and educational content. The main focus of Motherly is delivering behavioral activation (BA), a brief and structured psychological treatment. The app allows participants to schedule and engage in, and monitor activities according to a plan to avoid acting exclusively according to their mood. The active control group will have access to a simplified version of the app consisting of educational content about various aspects of pregnancy, maternal physical and mental health, and infant development (BA, activity scheduling, sleep hygiene, among other functionalities, will not be present in this version). Both groups will receive four sessions of brief CBT in 8weeks. Participants will be evaluated by assessors blind to randomization and allocation status. Assessments will occur at baseline (T0), midpoint (T1, week 4-5), posttreatment (T2, week 8), and follow-up (T3, when the child is 2 months old). Maternal mental health (prenatal anxiety, psychological well-being, perceived stress, depression, depression severity, and sleep quality), quality of life, physical activity levels, and infant developmental milestones and social/emotional problems will be measured. Our primary outcome is the change in maternal prenatal depression from baseline to posttreatment (8weeks).DiscussionThe potential of digital technology to deliver mental health interventions has been increasingly recognized worldwide. There is a growing literature on interventions using smartphone applications to promote mental health, both with or without the intermediation of a mental health professional. Our study adds to the literature by testing whether an app providing an intervention package, including CBT, psychoeducation, nutrition, physical activity, and social support, can promote maternal and child health and well-being. In particular, we aim to treat depression, for which the use of digital technologies is still scarce. Smartphone applications designed to treat maternal depression are especially relevant because of the potential to circumvent barriers that prevent pregnant women from accessing mental health care.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04495166.

In addition, analyses were stratified by geographical areas (17associations of statutory health insurance physicians).ResultsThe analyses presented an opportunity to generate maps illustrating patient sharing networks within the 17associations. The analyses demonstrated that general practitioners, psychiatrists and neurologists play amajor role in the treatment of patients with depression. It was also shown that different cooperation and cost structures varied by geographical area. Complete-coverage networking of all physicians was shown in Schleswig-Holstein. By contrast Rhineland-Palatinate had four distinct areas.ConclusionIn the future, differences in healthcare processes and cooperation between physicians might become more visible through network analyses. This would create opportunities for cooperation and coordination between different practitioners of higher quality.",10.1007/s00103-018-2862-4,"pubmed, wos","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Network analysis; Patient sharing networks; Graph theory; Analysis of claims data; Collaborative care,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s00103-018-2862-4)

BackgroundIn addition to physical conditions, people with acute myocardial infarction often experience psychological symptoms. However, there is limited empirical evidence on how to help individuals self-manage these psychological symptoms. DesignA single-blinded, randomized controlled trial is proposed. MethodsA convenience sample of 90 will be recruited. Eligible participants will be adult patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: Intervention 1 and standard care (n=30), Intervention 2 and standard care (n=30) and standard care alone (n=30). Data will be collected by self-reported questionnaires, physiological measures and open-ended questions. Quantitative data will be analysed by descriptive statistics, t-test, analysis of covariance and repeated measures analysis of variance. Open-ended questions will be analysed by content analysis. DiscussionThis study will identify a potentially efficacious symptom self-management programme for patients with acute myocardial infarction. If the efficacy of the programme is demonstrated, the programme can be integrated into hospital services to improve patient care.

A survey of participants in two internet support groups for people with hair-pulling,Good,"Bruwer, BR; Stein, DJ",BMC PSYCHIATRY,2005,"Background: A substantial number of patients suffering from psychological problems or psychiatric disorders have turned to internet support groups for help. This paper reports on the perceived effectiveness of trichotillomania (TTM) internet support groups for people suffering from hair-pulling. Methods: A questionnaire was sent via e-mail to all subscribers of two mailing lists devoted to TTM, each of which takes a somewhat different approach to the condition. The questionnaire addressed the possible benefits and problems associated with belonging to a TTM virtual support group. Results: Subscribers had similar demographic features as clinical samples of trichotillomania patients. Subscribers to both internet lists found them helpful in terms of feeling supported and in obtaining information. The different approaches to TTM on the two lists were associated with differences in treatments attempted by participants.

Interventions attending to maternal-infant interactions may improve outcomes for these parents and their children, but barriers to accessing in-person postpartum care limit uptake. We adapted a postpartum psychotherapy group for mothers with mental illness (e.g., mood, anxiety, trauma-related disorders) and ACE for live video-based delivery, and evaluated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in an open-label pilot study.MethodsWe recruited adults with children (6-18 months) from a perinatal psychiatry program in Toronto, Canada. The intervention was a live video-based 12-week interactive psychotherapy group focused on maternal symptoms and maternal-infant relationships. The primary outcome was feasibility, including feasibility of recruitment and retention, fidelity of the intervention, and acceptability to patients and group providers. Maternal clinical outcomes were compared pre- to post-intervention, as secondary outcomes.ResultsWe recruited 31 participants (mean age 36.5 years (SD 3.9)) into 6 groups; 93.6% (n = 29) completed post-group questionnaires, and n = 20 completed an optional post-group acceptability interview.

ADHD: Is There an App for That? A Suitability Assessment of Apps for the Parents of Children and Young People With ADHD,Good,"Powell, L; Parker, J; Harpin, V",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2017,"Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly comorbid disorder that can impact significantly on the individual and their family. ADHD is managed via pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions. Parents also gain support from parent support groups, which may include chat rooms, as well as face-to-face meetings. With the growth of technology use over recent years, parents have access to more resources that ever before. A number of mobile apps have been developed to help parents manage ADHD in their children and young people. Unfortunately many of these apps are not evidence-based, and little is known of their suitability for the parents or whether they are helpful in ADHD management. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the (1) parents' views of the suitability of the top ten listed apps for parents of children and young people with ADHD and (2) the views of clinicians that work with them on the suitability and value of the apps. Methods: The top 10 listed apps specifically targeted toward the parents of children and young people with ADHD were identified via the Google Play (n=5) and iTunes store (n=5). Interviews were then undertaken with 7 parents of children or young people with ADHD and 6 clinicians who specialize in working with this population to explore their opinions of the 10 apps identified and what they believe the key components are for apps to be suitable and valuable for this population. Results: Four themes emerged from clinician and parent interviews: (1) the importance of relating to the app, (2) apps that address ADHD-related difficulties, (3) how the apps can affect family relationships, and (4) apps as an educational tool. Two additional themes emerged from the clinician interviews alone: monitoring ADHD symptoms and that apps should be practical. Parents also identified an additional theme: the importance of the technology. Overall, the characteristics of the current top 10 listed apps did not appear to match well to the views of our sample. Conclusions: Findings suggest that these apps may not fully meet the complex needs of this parent population. Further research is required to explore the value of apps with this population and how they can be tailored to their very specific needs.",10.2196/mhealth.7941,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity; mobile applications; technology,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/mhealth.7941)

AI in patient flow: applications of artificial intelligence to improve patient flow in NHS acute mental health inpatient units,Other,"Dawoodbhoy, FM; Delaney, J; Cecula, P; Yu, JK; Peacock, I; Tan, J; Cox, B",HELIYON,2021,"Introduction: Growing demand for mental health services, coupled with funding and resource limitations, creates an opportunity for novel technological solutions including artificial intelligence (AI). This study aims to identify issues in patient flow on mental health units and align them with potential AI solutions, ultimately devising a model for their integration at service level. Method: Following a narrative literature review and pilot interview, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with AI and mental health experts. Thematic analysis was then used to analyse and synthesise gathered data and construct an enhanced model. Results: Predictive variables for length-of-stay and readmission rate are not consistent in the literature. There are, however, common themes in patient flow issues. An analysis identified several potential areas for AI-enhanced patient flow. Firstly, AI could improve patient flow by streamlining administrative tasks and optimising allocation of resources. Secondly, real-time data analytics systems could support clinician decision-making in triage, discharge, diagnosis and treatment stages. Finally, longer-term, development of solutions such as digital phenotyping could help transform mental health care to a more preventative, personalised model. Conclusions: Recommendations were formulated for NHS trusts open to adopting AI patient flow enhancements. Although AI offers many promising use-cases, greater collaborative investment and infrastructure are needed to deliver clinically validated improvements. Concerns around data-use, regulation and transparency remain, and hospitals must continue to balance guidelines with stakeholder priorities.

The COVID-19 pandemic interruption allowed additional measurement of the qualitative 'lived in' experiences of this patient group during the pandemic and also their appetite for virtual health. Participants: Thirty-two patients with knee osteoarthritis were recruited from a combined primary/secondary care waiting list and were allocated to either a six-week intervention group (ARMED) or to the six-week usual care ESCAPE pain group (Enabling Self-management and Coping with Arthritic Pain using Exercise) group. Results: The intervention programme was interrupted after three weeks by COVID-19. Fifteen patients were reassessed after the first stage. The average attendance was 92% with 6 patients attending all sessions, 5 attending 5/6, 1 attending 4/6 and 2 attending 3/6. One subject dropped out and 15/16 patients completed all outcome measurements. All patients completed the KOOS knee score and the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale to evaluate anxiety and depression. There was a statistically significant improvement in pain, activities of daily living, quality of life and mental health and well-being scores from time one to time 2. The mean weight, BMI and waist measurements were reduced also from time one to time 2, but these failed to reach significance. The semi-structured interviews provided rich information on enablers and barriers to coping in lockdown, benefits of the ARMED programme to increasing physical activity and weight management and enablers and barriers to redesigning the programme for online delivery. Conclusions: Evaluation of preliminary data from this feasibility study supports the three-week intervention combining education, exercise and weight management in this patient group even during a pandemic.

Acanthopanax senticosus improves cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease by promoting the phosphorylation of the MAPK signaling pathway,Not Digital,"Zhang, ZC; Wu, YH; Shi, D; Jiang, CY; Cao, HY; Jiang, FY; Bao, XM; Shen, Y; Shi, X",FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY,2024,"Background Acanthopanax senticosus (AS) can improve sleep, enhance memory, and reduce fatigue and is considered as an effective drug for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The therapeutic effect and mechanism need to be further investigated. Methods To confirm the AS play efficacy in alleviating memory impairment in mice, 5xFAD transgenic mice were subjected to an open-field experiment and a novelty recognition experiment. Network pharmacology technique was used to analyze the information of key compounds and potential key targets of AS for the treatment of AD, molecular docking technique was applied to predict the binding ability of targets and compounds, and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were also performed on the targets to derive the possible metabolic processes and pathway mechanisms of AS in treating AD. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot technique were carried out to validate the candidate genes and pathways. Results In the open-field experiment, compared with the wild-type (WT) group, the number of times the mice in the AD group crossed the central zone was significantly reduced (P< 0.01). Compared with the AD group, the number of times the mice in the AS group crossed the central zone was significantly increased (P< 0.001). In the new object recognition experiment, compared with the WT group, the percentage of times the AD group explored new objects was significantly reduced (P< 0.05). Compared with the AD group, the AS group had an increase in the percentage of time spent exploring new things and the number of times it was explored (P< 0.05). At the same time, the donepezil group had a significantly higher percentage of times exploring new things (P< 0.01). By using network pharmacology technology, 395 common targets of AS and AD were retrieved. The Cytoscape software was used to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of common targets. Using the algorithm, nine key targets were retrieved: APP, NTRK1, ESR1, CFTR, CSNK2A1, EGFR, ESR2, GSK3B, and PAK1. The results of molecular docking indicate that 11 pairs of compounds and their corresponding targets have a significant binding ability, as the molecular binding energies were less than -7.0. In comparison to the AD group, the mRNA expression of the key target genes was significantly decreased in the AS treatment group (P< 0.001). The KEGG analysis showed that the MAPK signaling pathway was significantly enriched, and Western blot confirmed that the TRAF6 protein decreased significantly (P< 0.0001). Meanwhile, the levels of MAP3K7 and P38 phosphorylation increased, and there was also an increase in the expression of HSP27 proteins. Conclusion Our study indicates that the multi-component and multi-target properties of AS play an important role in the alleviation of anxiety and memory impairment caused by AD, and the mechanism is involved in the phosphorylation and activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. The results of this study could provide a novel perspective for the clinical treatment of AD.",10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383464,"pubmed, wos",Immunology,Acanthopanax senticosus; Alzheimer's disease; network pharmacology; MAPK signaling pathway; neuroinflammation,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383464)

However, many individuals experience considerable barriers to attending face-to-face exercise services. To overcome some of these limitations, digital interventions that can be delivered remotely have been proposed. Our pilot study investigated the acceptability, safety and preliminary efficacy of an 8-week computer-tailored web-based exercise intervention. We demonstrated that a web-based exercise program with telehealth support was acceptable and could be implemented safely. Participants in the intervention group increased their participation in moderate to vigorous physical activity compared to the control group. This study provides insight into the prospect of web-based exercise prescription for individuals with metastatic prostate cancer as an alternative for individuals who cannot access supervised exercise interventions. Preliminary research has shown the effectiveness of supervised exercise-based interventions in alleviating sequela resulting from metastatic prostate cancer. However, many individuals encounter barriers that limit the uptake of face-to-face exercise. Technology-enabled interventions offer a distance-based alternative. This pilot study aimed to explore the acceptability, safety and preliminary efficacy of a web-based exercise intervention (ExerciseGuide) in individuals with metastatic prostate cancer. Forty participants (70.2 +/- 8.5 years) with metastatic prostate cancer were randomised into the 8-week intervention (N = 20) or a wait-list control (N = 20). The intervention arm had access to a computer-tailored website, personalised exercise prescription and remote supervision. ExerciseGuide was deemed acceptable with a score >= 20 on the client satisfaction questionnaire; however, the usability score was just below the pre-specified score of >= 68 on the software usability scale.

Acceptability and Utility of a Digital Group Intervention to Prevent Perinatal Depression in Youths via Interactive Maternal Group for Information and Emotional Support (IMAGINE): Pilot Cohort Study,Good,"Ronen K, Gewali A, Dachelet K, White E, Jean-Baptiste M, Evans YN, Unger JA, Tandon SD, Bhat A.",JMIR Form Res,2024,"Abstract
Background: Perinatal depression (depression during pregnancy or the first year postpartum) affects 10%-25% of perinatal individuals, with a higher risk among youths aged <25 years. The Mothers and Babies Course (MB) is an evidence-based intervention for the prevention of perinatal depression, grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy, attachment theory, and psychoeducation.

Objective: We developed a digital adaptation of MB (Interactive Maternal Group for Information and Emotional Support [IMAGINE]) and evaluated it in a pre-post mixed methods pilot among young perinatal people in the United States.

Methods: IMAGINE was a structured digital group of up to 7 participants, with scheduled MB content and open discussion for 12 weeks, facilitated by a social worker. Scheduled content included asynchronous SMS text messages, graphics, prerecorded videos, mood polls, and optional weekly synchronous video calls. Eligible participants were pregnant or ≤80 days postpartum, aged 16 to 24 years, had access to a smartphone, spoke English, and had a Patient Health Questionnaire score <10. Participants were recruited throughout the United States from August 2020 to January 2021 through paid social media ads, in-person outreach at clinics, and respondent-driven sampling. Participants completed quantitative questionnaires at enrollment and 3 months, and qualitative interviews at 3 months. We determined uptake, acceptability (by Acceptability of Intervention Measure score), and utility (by use of cognitive behavioral therapy skills). We compared depression symptoms (by Patient Health Questionnaire score), social support (by abbreviated Social Support Behavior score), and perceived stress (by Perceived Stress Score) between enrollment and follow-up by paired 2-tailed t test.

Results: Among 68 individuals who contacted this study, 22 were screened, 13 were eligible, and 10 enrolled, for an uptake of 76.9%. Furthermore, 4 (40%) participants were pregnant at enrollment. Participants had a median age of 17.9 (IQR 17.4-21.7) years, 6 (67%) identified as Black, 5 (56%) Latinx, and 6 (67%) using Medicaid health insurance. Further, 9 (90%) participants completed follow-up. Among these, the mean acceptability score was 4.3 out of 5 (SD 0.6) and all participants said they would recommend IMAGINE to a friend. Participants reported using a median of 7 of 11 skills (IQR 5-7 skills) at least half the days. We found no significant changes in depression symptoms, perceived stress, or social support. Qualitatively, participants reported one-to-one support from the facilitator, connection with other parents, and regular mood reflection were especially helpful aspects of the intervention. Additionally, participants reported that the intervention normalized their mental health challenges, improved their ability to manage their mood, and increased their openness to mental health care.

Conclusions: This pilot study provides promising evidence of the acceptability and utility of IMAGINE among perinatal youths. Our study's small sample size did not detect changes in clinical outcomes; our findings suggest IMAGINE warrants larger-scale evaluation.

Acceptability and Utility of a Digital Group Intervention to Prevent Perinatal Depression in Youths via Interactive Maternal Group for Information and Emotional Support (IMAGINE): Pilot Cohort Study,Good,"Ronen, K; Gewali, A; Dachelet, K; White, E; Jean-Baptiste, M; Evans, YN; Unger, JA; Tandon, SD; Bhat, A",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2024,"Background: Perinatal depression (depression during pregnancy or the first year postpartum) affects 10%-25% of perinatal individuals, with a higher risk among youths aged <25 years. The Mothers and Babies Course (MB) is an evidence -based intervention for the prevention of perinatal depression, grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy, attachment theory, and psychoeducation. Objective: We developed a digital adaptation of MB (Interactive Maternal Group for Information and Emotional Support [IMAGINE]) and evaluated it in a pre -post mixed methods pilot among young perinatal people in the United States. Methods: IMAGINE was a structured digital group of up to 7 participants, with scheduled MB content and open discussion for 12 weeks, facilitated by a social worker. Scheduled content included asynchronous SMS text messages, graphics, prerecorded videos, mood polls, and optional weekly synchronous video calls. Eligible participants were pregnant or <= 80 days postpartum, aged 16 to 24 years, had access to a smartphone, spoke English, and had a Patient Health Questionnaire score <10. Participants were recruited throughout the United States from August 2020 to January 2021 through paid social media ads, in -person outreach at clinics, and respondent -driven sampling. Participants completed quantitative questionnaires at enrollment and 3 months, and qualitative interviews at 3 months. We determined uptake, acceptability (by Acceptability of Intervention Measure score), and utility (by use of cognitive behavioral therapy skills). We compared depression symptoms (by Patient Health Questionnaire score), social support (by abbreviated Social Support Behavior score), and perceived stress (by Perceived Stress Score) between enrollment and follow-up by paired 2 -tailed t test. Results: Among 68 individuals who contacted this study, 22 were screened, 13 were eligible, and 10 enrolled, for an uptake of 76.9%. Furthermore, 4 (40%) participants were pregnant at enrollment. Participants had a median age of 17.9 (IQR 17.4-21.7) years, 6 (67%) identified as Black, 5 (56%) Latinx, and 6 (67%) using Medicaid health insurance. Further, 9 (90%) participants completed follow-up. Among these, the mean acceptability score was 4.3 out of 5 (SD 0.6) and all participants said they would recommend IMAGINE to a friend. Participants reported using a median of 7 of 11 skills (IQR 5-7 skills) at least half the days. We found no significant changes in depression symptoms, perceived stress, or social support. Qualitatively, participants reported one-to-one support from the facilitator, connection with other parents, and regular mood reflection were especially helpful aspects of the intervention. Additionally, participants reported that the intervention normalized their mental health challenges, improved their ability to manage their mood, and increased their openness to mental health care.

This study explored the acceptability and feasibility of the World Health Organization's Caregiver Skills Training Programme (WHO CST) in alternative delivery modes under new normal and post COVID-19 period. MethodCST was delivered via eLearning (EL), videoconferencing (VC), and in-person hybrid (IP) modes to 34 parent-child dyads, being randomly assigned to modes of asynchronous non-interfering EL (n = 9), synchronous with online coaching VC (n = 7), synchronous with in-person coaching IP (n = 9) and Wait-list Control WLC (n = 9). Data from two standardized scales of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Post-session and Home Visit Feedback Form by Caregivers that included both structured and open-ended questions were collected before and after intervention. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used in studying the collected data. ResultsHigh levels of acceptability and feasibility of the training programme were supported by ratings on comprehensiveness and relevance, agreement with their personal values, duration, and usefulness. IP and VC groups yielded more positive changes than EL and WLC groups with 3, 16, 13, and -3% in General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), -13, -15, -6 and 0% in Difficulties-total, and 36.5, 35.5, 5.8 and 2.4% in Prosocial Scale at Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for EL, VC, IP, and WLC groups respectively from baseline to 12 weeks after intervention. Results from two standardized scales echoed with qualitative observations that the programme helped improve caregivers' well-being, child's communication, and behaviors across intervention groups. ConclusionsCurrent findings revealed that CST delivered in three alternative modes were acceptable and feasible, and yielded positive impacts toward both caregivers and children. In-person coaching, and skill-practicing sessions were effective in mitigating child's challenging behaviors while personal interaction, either face-to-face or virtual, is a significant factor in uplifting caregivers' well-being, whereas the self-learning model was appreciated by the busy caregivers.

Objective: This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a scalable self-led mindfulness-based intervention to reduce diabetes distress in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Methods: Adolescents (N=25) aged between 14 and 18 years diagnosed with type 1 diabetes completed a baseline assessment. Participants were randomized to receive a 10-week self-guided mindfulness-based stress reduction workbook program (e-book or paper option) immediately (n=15) or after a 10 -week wait (n=10). During the intervention period, participants completed weekly assignments and feedback surveys. At 10 weeks and 20 weeks, follow-up assessments were completed. Results: Findings indicated that participants did not find the original intervention feasible or acceptable. Adolescents reported barriers to completing the weekly material, such as that they forgot or that the material was not sufficiently related to their diabetes management. Adolescents also reported that a digital format rather than a workbook or e-book may be more acceptable.

Acceptance of smart sensing: a barrier to implementation-results from a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Terhorst, Y; Weilbacher, N; Suda, C; Simon, L; Messner, EM; Sander, LB; Baumeister, H",FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH,2023,"BackgroundAccurate and timely diagnostics are essential for effective mental healthcare. Given a resource- and time-limited mental healthcare system, novel digital and scalable diagnostic approaches such as smart sensing, which utilizes digital markers collected via sensors from digital devices, are explored. While the predictive accuracy of smart sensing is promising, its acceptance remains unclear. Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, the present study investigated (1) the effectiveness of an acceptance facilitating intervention (AFI), (2) the determinants of acceptance, and (3) the acceptance of adults toward smart sensing. MethodsThe participants (N = 202) were randomly assigned to a control group (CG) or intervention group (IG). The IG received a video AFI on smart sensing, and the CG a video on mindfulness. A reliable online questionnaire was used to assess acceptance, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, and trust. The self-reported interest in using and the installation of a smart sensing app were assessed as behavioral outcomes. The intervention effects were investigated in acceptance using t-tests for observed data and latent structural equation modeling (SEM) with full information maximum likelihood to handle missing data. The behavioral outcomes were analyzed with logistic regression. The determinants of acceptance were analyzed with SEM. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) were used to evaluate the model fit. ResultsThe intervention did not affect the acceptance (p = 0.357), interest (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.42-1.32, p = 0.314), or installation rate (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.01-2.35, p = 0.294). The performance expectancy (& gamma; = 0.45, p < 0.001), trust (& gamma; = 0.24, p = 0.002), and social influence (& gamma; = 0.32, p = 0.008) were identified as the core determinants of acceptance explaining 68% of its variance. The SEM model fit was excellent (RMSEA = 0.06, SRMR = 0.05). The overall acceptance was M = 10.9 (SD = 3.73), with 35.41% of the participants showing a low, 47.92% a moderate, and 10.41% a high acceptance. DiscussionThe present AFI was not effective. The low to moderate acceptance of smart sensing poses a major barrier to its implementation. The performance expectancy, social influence, and trust should be targeted as the core factors of acceptance.

Achieving Self-Directed Integrated Cancer Aftercare (ASICA) in melanoma: protocol for a randomised patient-focused pilot trial of delivering the ASICA intervention as a means to earlier detection of recurrent and second primary melanoma,Other,"Murchie, P; Masthoff, J; Walter, FM; Rahman, K; Allan, JL; Burrows, N; Proby, C; Lee, AJ; Johnston, M; Durrani, A; Depasquale, I; Brant, B; Neilson, A; Meredith, F; Treweek, S; Hall, S; McDonald, A",TRIALS,2019,"BackgroundMelanoma is common; 15,906 people in the UK were diagnosed with melanoma in 2015 and incidence has increased fivefold in 30years. Melanoma affects old and young people, with poor prognosis once metastatic. UK guidelines recommend people treated for cutaneous melanoma receive extended outpatient, hospital follow up to detect recurrence or new primaries. Such follow up of the growing population of melanoma survivors is burdensome for both individuals and health services. Follow up is important since approximately 20% of patients with early-stage melanoma experience a recurrence and 4-8% develop a new primary; the risk of either is highest in the first 5 years. Achieving Self-directed Integrated Cancer Aftercare (ASICA) is a digital intervention to increase total-skin-self-examination (TSSE) by people treated for melanoma, with usual follow up.MethodsWe aim to recruit 240 adults with a previous first-stage 0-2C primary cutaneous melanoma, from secondary care in North-East Scotland and the East of England. Participants will be randomised to receive the ASICA intervention (a tablet-based digital intervention to prompt and support TSSE) or control group (treatment as usual). Patient-reported and clinical data will be collected at baseline, including the modified Melanoma Worry Scale (MWS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADs), the EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), and questions about TSSE practice, intentions, self-efficacy and planning. Participants will be followed up by postal questionnaire at 3, 6 and 12months following randomization, along with a 12-month review of clinical data.The primary timepoint for outcome analyses will be12months after randomisation.DiscussionIf the ASICA intervention improves the practice of TSSE in those affected by melanoma, this may lead to improved psychological well-being and earlier detection of recurrent and new primary melanoma. This could impact both patients and National Health Service (NHS) resources. This study will determine if a full-scale randomised controlled trial can be undertaken in the UK NHS to provide the high-quality evidence needed to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.

Activity and Health During the SARS-CoV2 Pandemic (ASAP): Study Protocol for a Multi-National Network Trial,Other,"Wilke, J; Mohr, L; Tenforde, AS; Vogel, O; Hespanhol, L; Vogt, L; Verhagen, E; Hollander, K",FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE,2020,"Introduction:The worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has prompted numerous countries to restrict public life. Related measures, such as limits on social gatherings, business closures, or lockdowns, are expected to considerably reduce the individual opportunities to move outside the home. As physical activity (PA) and sport participation significantly contribute to health, this study has two objectives. The objectives of this study are to assess changes in PA and well-being since the coronavirus outbreak in affected countries. Additionally, we will evaluate the impact of digital home-based exercise programs on PA as well as physical and mental health outcomes. Method:A multinational network trial will be conducted with three planned phases (A, B, and C). Part A consists of administering a structured survey. It investigates changes in PA levels and health during the coronavirus outbreak and measures the preferences of the participants regarding online training programs. Part B is a two-armed randomized-controlled trial. Participants assigned to the intervention group (IG) will complete a digital 4-week home exercise training (live streaming via internet) guided by the survey results on content and time of program. The control group (CG) will not receive the program. Part C is 4-week access of both CG and IG to a digital archive of pre-recorded workouts from Part B. Similar to Part A, questionnaires will be used in both Part B and C to estimate the effects of exercise on measures of mental and physical health. Results and Discussion:The ASAP project will provide valuable insights into the importance of PA during a global pandemic. Our initial survey is the first to determine how governmental confinement measures impact bodily and mental well-being. Based on the results, the intervention studies will be unique to address health problems potentially arising from losses in PA. If proven effective, the newly developed telehealth programs could become a significant and easy-to-distribute factor in combating PA decreases. Results of the study may hence guide policy makers on methods to maintain PA and health when being forced to restrict public life.

Acute Effects of a Single-Dose Nutritional Product on Stress Response and Task Completion in Horses,Not Digital,"Pearson, W; MacNicol, J",JOURNAL OF EQUINE VETERINARY SCIENCE,2017,"There is a growing number of nutraceutical products for promoting tractability and reducing anxiety in horses, despite a virtual absence of scientific assessment of these products. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of acepromazine (ACE) and a magnesium-based antianxiety formulation in horses participating in tasks typical of normal equine management. Six horses were randomly allocated to one of the three treatment groups in a 2 x 3 randomized block design. Each horse was fitted with a heart rate (HR) monitor, and received a single dose of ACE (0.5 cc/horse), the nutritional formulation (NUT), or a placebo paste exactly 30 minutes before commencement of tasks. Tasks included loading onto an equine weighbridge, loading onto a two-horse trailer, unaccompanied transport in a two-horse trailer, jugular venous blood sampling, and 10 minutes in a stall with an unfamiliar object. Stress response with respect to peak and average HR, time to completion of tasks, and plasma cortisol were measured. This study demonstrated that tasks inherent to modern equine management are sufficient to induce a stress response, as demonstrated by increased peak and average HRs, and increased plasma cortisol. The average HR of the earliest task (30 minutes after ACE and NUT administration) was effectively blunted by administration of ACE or NUT 30 minutes before onset of stress. It is concluded that oral ACE and NUT reduce HRavg during a stressful task with which they were challenged 30 minutes after administration. Effects of these treatments on plasma cortisol require further research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The website includes 5 lifestyle behavior change modules and a 12-week well-being intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy. It was timely to adapt the resource for a new audience in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Young persons' mental health needs have increased substantially, and lifestyle behaviors play a critical role in both mental and physical health statuses.Objective: This study aimed to adapt an existing health and well-being website for use by young persons aged 16 to 24 years.Methods: A 3-staged participatory, co-design approach was adopted. The participants reviewed the existing program and provided feedback (stage 1) before cocreating new content (stage 2). Finally, the updated program underwent formative evaluation (stage 3). Two groups were created: one had access for 3 weeks and the other could self-select their study duration. The options were 3 weeks, 60 days, or 90 days. Outcome measures were the Warwick and Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and Acceptance and Action Questionnaire version 2.Results: Stage 1 identified that the website was appealing to the new audience (19/24, 79%), and the 3 web-based focus group discussions explored data from the written review in more depth to identify and clarify the main areas for update and adaptation. Overall, 3 themes were developed, and the data informed the creation of 6 tasks for use in 5 web-based co-design workshops. Stage 2 led to the cocreation of 36 outputs, including a new name, new content, scenarios, images, and a new user dashboard, which included streaks and an updated color scheme. After the website update program was completed, 40 participants registered to use the website for formative evaluation (stage 3). Data analysis revealed differences in engagement, completion, and mean well-being after intervention between the 2 groups. The completion rate was 68% in the 3-week duration group, and well-being scores improved after intervention.Conclusions: Young persons engaged actively with the participatory design process. The participants discussed the updates they desired during the web-based discussions, which worked well via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications Inc) when small groups were used. The participants easily cocreated new content during the web-based co-design workshops. The web-based format enabled a range of participants to take part, share their ideas, search for images, and design digital content creatively together. The Zoom software enabled screen sharing and collaborative whiteboard use, which helped the cocreation process.

Adaptation of the trauma group intervention 'Teaching Recovery Techniques' for online delivery: A participatory design and usability study,Not Digital,"Pérez-Aronsson, A; Thell, M; Lampa, E; Löfving, SG; Tökés, A; Torakai, N; Ibrahim, K; Aljeshy, R; Warner, G",INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH,2022,"Background: Video-telehealth delivery of trauma-based care is promising and may help address structural and perceptual barriers to receiving support. However, existing evidence relies heavily on samples from adult pop-ulations. There is potential to transfer existing child and adolescent trauma interventions to a video-telehealth delivery format; but, this requires careful consideration. The aim of this project was to adapt a group-based intervention called Teaching Recovery Techniques for online delivery and investigate the usability of the new intervention format.Methods: A qualitative needs assessment was performed (n = 3 intervention leaders, 4 youth), followed by participatory workshops and advisory panel consultation to generate adaptation recommendations. Usability testing was performed in two cycles; the first tested the adapted manual with intervention leaders (n = 5), and the second tested newly developed digital resources with youth (n = 5).Results: The needs assessment uncovered a number of issues that, when generating recommendations, were distilled into three topics: safety, participation and learning. Recommendations included safety rules, an emer-gency response protocol, communication strategies, and guidance on group composition and intervention de-livery. Usability testing indicated acceptability but highlighted the need for more detailed and explicit guidance, particularly on safety processes. Discussion: The present study demonstrates the potential for delivery format to affect intervention feasibility and acceptability, and provides recommendations that can be used to guide the transfer of other group-based mental health interventions to an online format.

Adapting DIALOG+ in a School Setting-A Tool to Support Well-being and Resilience in Adolescents Living in Postconflict Areas During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Exploratory Study,Other,"Gómez-Restrepo, C; Sarmiento-Suárez, MJ; Alba-Saavedra, M; Bird, VJ; Priebe, S; van Loggerenberg, F",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2022,"Background: Colombia has a long history of an armed conflict that has severely affected communities with forced internal displacement and violence. Victims of violence and armed conflicts have higher rates of mental health disorders, and children and adolescents are particularly affected. However, the mental health needs of this population are often overlooked, especially in low- and middle-Income countries, where scarcity of resources exacerbates the problem that has been further compounded by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, special attention should be paid to the development of interventions that target this population. Objective: Our research aims to adapt an existing patient-centered digital intervention called DIALOG+ from a clinical setting to an educational setting using stakeholders' (teachers'and students') perspectives. We aim to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and estimated effect of implementing this intervention as a tool for the identification and mobilization of personal and social resources to mitigate the impact of social difficulties and to promote mental well-being. Methods: We will conduct an exploratory mixed methods study in public schools of postconflict areas in Tolima, Colombia. The study consists of 3 phases: adaptation, exploration, and consolidation of the DIALOG+ tool. The adaptation phase will identify possible changes that the intervention requires on the basis of data from focus groups with teachers and students. The exploration phase will be an exploratory cluster randomized trial with teachers and school counselors to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and estimated effect of DIALOG+ for adolescents in school settings. Adolescents' data about mental health symptoms and wellness will be collected before and after DIALOG+ implementation. During this phase, teachers or counselors who were part of the intervention group will share their opinions through the think-aloud method. Lastly, the consolidation phase will consist of 2 focus groups with teachers and students to discuss their experiences and to understand acceptability. Results: Study recruitment was completed in March 2022, and follow-up is anticipated to last through November 2022. Conclusions: This exploratory study will evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and estimated effect of DIALOG+ for adolescents in postconflict school settings in Colombia.

Adapting a Theory-Informed Intervention to Help Young Adult Couples Cope With Reproductive and Sexual Concerns After Cancer,Population,"Gorman, JR; Lyons, KS; Reese, JB; Acquati, C; Smith, E; Drizin, JH; Salsman, JM; Flexner, LM; Hayes-Lattin, B; Harvey, SM",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2022,"ObjectiveMost young adults diagnosed with breast or gynecologic cancers experience adverse reproductive or sexual health (RSH) outcomes due to cancer and its treatment. However, evidence-based interventions that specifically address the RSH concerns of young adult and/or LGBTQ+ survivor couples are lacking. Our goal is to develop a feasible and acceptable couple-based intervention to reduce reproductive and sexual distress experience by young adult breast and gynecologic cancer survivor couples with diverse backgrounds. MethodsWe systematically adapted an empirically supported, theoretically grounded couple-based intervention to address the RSH concerns of young couples coping with breast or gynecologic cancer through integration of stakeholder perspectives. We interviewed 11 couples (22 individuals) with a history of breast or gynecologic cancer to review and pretest intervention materials. Three of these couples were invited to review and comment on intervention modifications. Content experts in RSH and dyadic coping, clinicians, and community advisors (one heterosexual couple and one LGBTQ+ couple, both with cancer history) participated throughout the adaptation process. ResultsFindings confirmed the need for an online, couple-based intervention to support young couples experiencing RSH concerns after breast or gynecologic cancer. Qualitative themes suggested intervention preferences for: (1) A highly flexible intervention that can be tailored to couples' specific RSH concerns; (2) Active steps to help members of a dyad get on the same page in their relationship and family building plans; (3) A specific focus on raising partners' awareness about how cancer can affect body image and physical intimacy; and (4) Accessible, evidence-based information about RSH for both partners. These results, along with feedback from stakeholders, informed adaptation and finalization of the intervention content and format. The resulting virtual intervention, Opening the Conversation, includes five weekly sessions offering training to couples in communication and dyadic coping skills for addressing RSH concerns. ConclusionThe systematic adaptation process yielded a theory-informed intervention for young adult couples facing breast and gynecological cancers, which will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.

Adapting an Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic to Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Practice Perspective,Good,"Sasangohar, F; Bradshaw, MR; Carlson, MM; Flack, JN; Fowler, JC; Freeland, D; Head, J; Marder, K; Orme, W; Weinstein, B; Kolman, JM; Kash, B; Madan, A",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2020,"As the demand for telepsychiatry increases during the COVID-19 pandemic, the strengths and challenges of telepsychiatry implementation must be articulated to improve clinical practices in the long term. Currently, observations within US contexts are lacking; therefore, we report on the rapid implementation of telepsychiatry and workflow experiences in a psychiatric practice based within a large health care system in southeast Texas with a national catchment area. We discuss the logistics of the implementation, including modes of communication, scheduling, coordination, and capacity; the psychological effects of web-based services, including both the loss of the physical therapeutic environment and the unique interpersonal dynamics experienced in the virtual environment; and postadoption patterns of engagement with our services and with other clinical functions affected by the rapid adaptation to telemedicine. Our art therapy group programming serves as an applied case study, demonstrating the value of a well-managed web-based program (eg, patients were receptive and well-engaged, and they appreciated the continuity of accessible service) as well as the challenges (eg, the need for backup plans and technological fallbacks, managing interruptions and telecommunication learning curves, and working around the difference in resources for art and music therapy between a well-stocked clinical setting versus clients' home spaces). We conclude from our experience that the overall strengths of telepsychiatry include receptive and well-engaged responses from patients as well as the expansion of boundaries, which provides a directly contextualized view into patients' home lives. Challenges and corresponding recommendations include the need for more careful safety planning for high-risk patients; maintaining professional boundaries in the newly informal virtual setting; designing the physical space to both frame the patient encounter and maintain work-life balance for the therapist; allowing for delays and interruptions (including an initial acclimation session); and preserving interprofessional care team collaboration when the physical locations that normally facilitate such encounters are not accessible.

Adding a smartphone app to internet-based self-help for social anxiety: A randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Boettcher, J; Magnusson, K; Marklund, A; Berglund, E; Blomdahl, R; Braun, U; Delin, L; Lundén, C; Sjöblom, K; Sommer, D; von Weber, K; Andersson, G; Carlbring, P",COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,2018,"Background: Increasing access to treatment via smartphone apps is an important topic in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). 'Challenger' is an app promoting exposure exercises in daily life. The present study evaluated the additional benefit of using the app as adjunct to Internet-based unguided self-help for SAD. In a second step, we also tested how the app and the self-help programme (SH) should best be combined. Method: 209 patients diagnosed with SAD were randomly allocated to three groups. Group 1 received the app and the self-help programme for six weeks (parallel treatment), group 2 first received SH for six weeks and then the app for six weeks (sequential treatment). Group 3 was a wait-list group. Comparisons were made at week 7 evaluating the potential add-on effect of the app (SH plus app versus SH only) and at week 14 comparing the parallel to the sequential treatment. Participants filled in questionnaires prior, during, and post treatment, and at 4- and 12- months follow-up. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses showed no significant effect of adding the app to Internet-based self-help. However, among participants actively using the app, adding Challenger to self-help resulted in significantly less social anxiety (d = 0.30). At week 14, decreases in social anxiety were large for both the parallel and the sequential group with no differences between the active groups (d(within) = 1.12-1.19). Changes were maintained throughout the follow-up period. Conclusion: Results of the current study cautiously support the notion of adding a smartphone app to unguided self-help for SAD. Future studies should investigate how patients can be motivated to use the app more frequently. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Addressing burgeoning unmet needs in college mental health,Population,"Singh, MK; Malmon, A; Horne, L; Felten, O",JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH,2022,"America is experiencing burgeoning mental health needs of their college students. Measuring the impact of mental health challenges for these students and the natural ways they adapt to them might enable smart triage of limited mental health resources. This may, in part, be achieved through a combination of technology-assisted personalized measurement-based care, treatment matching, and peer-support. Helping students self-monitor and organize their personal peer networks can destigmatize and increase accessibility to timely mental health care, especially for students of marginalized identities, who might otherwise be hesitant to receive care or be misdiagnosed. A collaborative effort among students, educators, clinicians, and health technology innovators may provide more tractable solutions for student unmet needs than any single entity or resource alone. Novel resources, tailored through a healthy equity lens that is individualized and culturally-sensitive, may meaningfully meet a student's needs, preferences, and acceptability, and translate to daily use and informed decision-making.",10.1080/07448481.2022.2115302,"pubmed, wos","Education & Educational Research; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",College mental health; counseling; depression; digital technology; peer support,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2115302)

Income, education, geographic location, and ethnicity are some of the most important underlying reasons for health disparities in cancer across Europe. Costs of healthcare, access to information, psycho-oncological support options, integration of cancer research and innovative care, and multidisciplinary cancer teams are the main target areas when it comes to addressing disparities in the cancer context. As part of the Beacon Project (BEACON), we developed a protocol for a qualitative study to explore and identify any relevant reasons for cancer inequalities and disparities in Europe. Methods: Our four stakeholders namely, cancer patients, healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers will be recruited online, facilitated by collaborative efforts with cancer organizations from various European countries, including but not limited to Italy, Croatia, Estonia, and Slovenia. Qualitative online focus group discussions for each stakeholder will be conducted and transcribed. Subsequently, thematic analysis will be used to identify reasons and aspects that may contribute to the existing disparities in cancer outcomes at various levels of engagement and from different stakeholders' perspectives. Results from focus groups will inform a subsequent Delphi study and a SWOT analysis methodology. Discussion: Although advances in medical research, cancer screening and treatment options are constantly progressing, disparities in access to and awareness of healthcare in cancer patients are even more noticeable. Thus, mapping the capacity and capability of cancer centres in the European Union, creating decision support tools that will assist the four stakeholders' information needs and improving the quality of European cancer centres will be the main objectives of the BEACON project.

Addressing the Mental and Emotional Health Impacts of COVID-19 on Children and Adolescents: Lessons From HIV/AIDS,Not mental health,"Banati, P; Idele, P",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to lasting mental health and psychosocial consequences just as were experienced with the HIV epidemic. A rapid review of published systematic reviews on HIV/AIDS and mental health outcomes and responses among children and adolescents was used to identify lessons for the COVID-19 pandemic response. The review found that HIV/AIDS responses to promote mental health, prevent ill-health and treat mental health conditions included diverse interventions at the structural or national, community, household and individual levels. Some of these responses can be easily replicated, others require substantial adaptation, and some can inform development of new innovative offline and online responses to mitigate impact of COVID-19 on mental health of children and adolescents. Programs that mitigate economic impacts including child grants, income generating activities for caregivers, food distribution, health care vouchers, and other economic empowerment interventions can be replicated with minor adjustments. Helplines for vulnerable or abused children and shelters for victims of gender-based violence can be scaled up to respond to the COVID pandemic, with minimal adaptation to adhere to prevention of contagion. Mass media campaigns to combat stigma and discrimination were successfully employed in the HIV response, and similar interventions could be developed and applied in the COVID context. Some programs will need more substantial adjustments. In health facilities, mainstreaming child-sensitive mental health training of frontline workers and task sharing/shifting to community volunteers and social workers as was done for HIV with community health workers, could advance mental illness detection, particularly among abuse victims, but requires adaptation of protocols. At the community and household levels, expansion of parenting programs can help caregivers navigate negative mental health effects on children, however, these are not often operating at scale, nor well-linked to services. Programs requiring innovation include converting adolescent and youth safe physical spaces into virtual spaces particularly for at-risk girls and young women; organizing virtual community support groups, conversations, and developing online resources. Re-opening of schools and introduction of health and hygiene policies, provides another opportunity for innovation - to provide mental health and psychosocial support to all children as a standard package of care and practice.",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.589827,wos,Psychiatry,COVID-19; mental health; psychosocial; children; adolescents; HIV; AIDS; rapid review,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.589827)
Adjunctive avatar therapy for mentalization-based treatment of borderline personality disorder: a mixed-methods feasibility study,Good,"Falconer, CJ; Cutting, P; Davies, EB; Hollis, C; Stallard, P; Moran, P",EVIDENCE-BASED MENTAL HEALTH,2017,"Background Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterised by severe instability in emotions, identity, relationships and impulsive behaviour. One contributing factor to BPD is deficient mentalizing-our ability to understand the mental states of others and ourselves. Psychotherapies can be effective at reducing symptoms of BPD but effects are small. Innovative ways of enhancing existing therapies are therefore essential. Objective In a mixed-methods, feasibility and acceptability study, we adjuncted conventional mentalization-based treatment (MBT) for BPD with avatar software (avatar-MBT). We wanted to test whether the enhanced visual narrative afforded by the software would facilitate therapy. Methods We used proprietary avatar software in four group MBT sessions. We collected data on uptake (n=15), dropout (n=4) and self-report measures (n=11) of mentalization and mood and conducted qualitative interviews to assess attitudes and beliefs (n=9). Findings Thematic analysis revealed five themes on the usefulness of avatar-MBT, including facilitating perspective taking, expression, emotional distancing, the big picture and group participation. The sixth theme suggested avatar-MBT is best placed within a group setting. There was no deterioration in symptoms as monitored by self-report measures. Conclusions Qualitative data suggest that avatar-MBT is acceptable to patients with BPD who described it as enhancing conventional MBT and expressed a wish to continue using it. However, controlled trials are required to assess efficacy. Clinical implications Results suggest that avatar-MBT may be a viable option to enhance existing BPD treatment.

Health promotion during adolescence has been shown to contribute to the prevention of late onset of the mental health disease. However, scalable interventions have not been established yet. Objective: This study was designed to test the efficacy of two adolescent health promotion interventions: a well-care visit (WCV) with a risk assessment interview and counseling and self-monitoring with a smartphone cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) app. Our hypothesis was that participants who had received both WCV and the CBT app would have better outcomes than those who had received only WCV or those who had not received any intervention. We conducted a prospective multi-institutional randomized controlled trial. Methods: Participants were 217 adolescents aged 13-18 years. They were randomly divided into two intervention groups (WCV group and WCV with CBT app group) and a nonintervention group. WCV comprised a standardized physical examination along with a structured interview and counseling for youth risk assessment, which was designed with reference to the Guideline for Health Supervision of Adolescents of Bright Futures. A smartphone-based CBT program was developed based on the CBT approach. The CBT app comprised a 1-week psychoeducation component and a 1-week self-monitoring component. During the CBT program, participants created several self-monitoring sheets based on the CBT model with five window panels: event, thoughts, feelings, body response, and actions. The primary outcome was the change in scores for depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes in scores for self-esteem, quality of life, self-monitoring, and an adolescent health promotion scale. These outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 1, 2, and 4 months after baseline. The exploratory outcome was the presence of suicidal ideation during the observation period. Intervention effects were estimated using mixed effect models. Results: In total, 94% (204/217) of the participants completed the 4-month evaluation. Both intervention groups showed a significant effect in the form of reduced scores for depressive symptoms at 1 month in high school students; however, these effects were not observed at 2 and 4 months. The intervention effect was significantly more predominant in those scoring above cutoff for depressive symptoms. There was significantly less suicidal ideation in the intervention groups. As for secondary outcomes, there was significant increase in health promotion scale scores at the 4-month follow-up among junior high school students in the WCV group. Moreover, the CBT app was significantly effective in terms of obtaining self-monitoring skills and reducing depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Although adolescent health promotion interventions may have short-term benefits, the frequency of WCV and further revision of the CBT app should be considered to evaluate long-term effectiveness.",10.2196/34154,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,health promotion; well-care visit; cognitive behavioral therapy; app; randomized controlled trial; RCT; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/34154)

To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five adolescents who used an adjunctive mobile mental health app in combination with telehealth cognitive behavioral group therapy for social anxiety. Using a multidimensional framework of treatment engagement, we elicited their perspectives on how the app impacted their engagement in telehealth group therapy and gathered their suggestions for improving the app. Using a consensual qualitative research approach, we learned that adolescents felt the app increased their comfort with others in therapy and their expectations about the effectiveness of mental health apps. They also indicated that the app prepared them for in-session participation and facilitated out-of-session skills practice.

Amelioration of cerebellar dysfunction in rats following postnatal ethanol exposure using low-intensity pulsed ultrasound,Not mental health,"Bolbanabad, HM; Anvari, E; Rezai, MJ; Moayeri, A; Kaffashian, MR",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL NEUROANATOMY,2017,"Background: The neonatal development stage of the cerebellum in rats is equivalent to a human foetus in the third trimester of pregnancy. In this stage, cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and synaptogenesis occur. Clinical and experimental findings have shown that ethanol exposure during brain development causes a variety of disruptions to the brain, including neurogenesis depression, delayed neuronal migration, changes in neurotransmitter synthesis, and neuronal depletion.During postnatal cerebellar development, neurons are more vulnerable to the destructive effects of ethanol. The effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on the number of cells and thickness of the cell layers within the cerebellar cortex were examined during the first two postnatal weeks in rats following postnatal ethanol exposure. Method: Postpartum rats were distributed randomly into six groups. Normal saline was injected intraperitoneally into control animals and ethanol (20%) was injected into the intervention groups for three consecutive days. Intervention groups received LIPUS at different frequencies (3 or 5 MHz), after administration of ethanol. After transcardial perfusion, the rat's brain was removed, and a complete series of sagittal cerebellum sections were obtained by systematic random manner. Photomicrographs were made with Motic digital cameras and analysed using Nikon digital software. Results: The numbers of granular cells decreased in ethanol-treated rats compared to the control group. LIPUS, administered at (3 or 5 MHz), combined with ethanol administration resulted in a reduction of ethanol's effects. Using 5 MHz LIPUS resulted in significantly higher numbers of granular cells in the internal layer compared to the control rats. Using 3 or 5 MHz LIPUS alone resulted in a significant enhancement in the granular cells of the molecular layer. A significant reduction was seen in the thickness of the external granular layer in ethanol-treated rats. Conclusion: This study showed that exposure to LIPUS can affect the number of granular cells and thickness of the cell layer within the cerebellar cortex in neonatal rats. LIPUS also could attenuate ethanol toxicity effects on the cerebellum. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Before this study, researchers and stakeholders collaboratively designed an app prototype based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), an evidence-based form of cognitive behavioral therapy that uses strategies such as mindfulness, clarification of personal values, and value-based goal setting. The intervention also included social skills training, an established approach for increasing individuals' confidence in managing social interactions, which evoke appearance-based anxiety for many. Objective: In this study, the authors aim to evaluate the feasibility of an ACT-based app prototype via the primary objectives of user engagement and acceptability and the secondary feasibility objective of clinical safety and preliminary effectiveness. Methods: To address the feasibility objectives, the authors used a single-group intervention design with mixed methods in a group of 36 participants who have a range of visible differences. The authors collected quantitative data via measures of program use, satisfaction ratings, and changes over 3 time points spanning 12 weeks in outcomes, including selected ACT process measures (experiential avoidance, cognitive defusion, and valued action), scales of appearance concerns (appearance-based life disengagement, appearance-fixing behaviors, appearance self-evaluation, and fear of negative appearance evaluation), and clinical well-being (depression and anxiety). Semistructured exit interviews with a subsample of 12 participants provided qualitative data to give a more in-depth understanding of participants' views and experiences of the program. Results: In terms of user engagement, adherence rates over 6 sessions aligned with the upper boundary of those reported across mobile mental health apps, with over one-third of participants completing all sessions over 12 weeks, during which a steady decline in adherence was observed. Time spent on sessions matched design intentions, and engagement frequencies highlighted semiregular mindfulness practice, mixed use of value-based goal setting, and high engagement with social skills training. The findings indicate a good overall level of program acceptability via satisfaction ratings, and qualitative interview findings offer positive feedback as well as valuable directions for revisions. Overall, testing for clinical safety and potential effectiveness showed encouraging changes over time, including favorable changes in appearance-related life disengagement, appearance-fixing behaviors, and selected ACT measures. No iatrogenic effects were indicated for depression or anxiety. Conclusions: An ACT-based mobile program for individuals struggling with visible differences shows promising proof of concept in addressing appearance concerns, although further revisions and development are required before further development and more rigorous evaluation.",10.2196/33449,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/33449)

An App-Based Blended Intervention to Reduce Body Dissatisfaction: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study,Good,"Kollei, I; Lukas, CA; Loeber, S; Berking, M",JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY,2017,"OBJECTIVE: As a common experience in the general population, dissatisfaction with one's body is associated with a variety of psychological problems and unhealthy behaviors, including the development of eating disorders. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to develop and evaluate an app-based intervention to reduce body dissatisfaction. METHOD: Participants reporting elevated levels of body dissatisfaction were randomly allocated to an app-based intervention (n = 26) or to a wait list group (n = 27). The app-based intervention included a brief counseling session and 14 days of training with the Mindtastic Body Dissatisfaction app (MT-BD). The MT-BD app uses gamification strategies to systematically foster approach of functional and avoidance of dysfunctional stimuli. The primary outcome was body dissatisfaction as assessed with the Body Dissatisfaction scale of the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (Garner, 1991). Secondary outcome measures included severity of eating disorder symptoms and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group showed significantly greater reductions in body dissatisfaction compared to the wait list group (d = -0.62). The intervention group also showed greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms compared to the wait list group (d = -0.46). Reductions in body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms were sustained at a 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: We found preliminary evidence that an app-based intervention may significantly reduce body dissatisfaction.

An App-Based Just-in-Time Adaptive Self-management Intervention for Care Partners (CareQOL): Protocol for a Pilot Trial,Other,"Carlozzi, NE; Choi, SW; Wu, ZK; Miner, JA; Lyden, AK; Graves, C; Wang, JT; Sen, S",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2021,"Background: Care partners (ie, informal family caregivers) of individuals with health problems face considerable physical and emotional stress, often with a substantial negative impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of both care partners and care recipients. Given that these individuals are often overwhelmed by their caregiving responsibilities, low-burden self-management interventions are needed to support care partners to ensure better patient outcomes. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to describe an intensive data collection protocol that involves the delivery of a personalized just-in-time adaptive intervention that incorporates passive mobile sensor data feedback (sleep and activity data from a Fitbit [Fitbit LLC]) and real time self-reporting of HRQOL via a study-specific app called CareQOL (University of Michigan) to provide personalized feedback via app alerts. Methods: Participants from 3 diverse care partner groups will be enrolled (care partners of persons with spinal cord injury, care partners of persons with Huntington disease, and care partners of persons with hematopoietic cell transplantation). Participants will be randomized to either a control group, where they will wear the Fitbit and provide daily reports of HRQOL over a 3-month (ie, 90 days) period (without personalized feedback), or the just-in-time adaptive intervention group, where they will wear the Fitbit, provide daily reports of HRQOL, and receive personalized push notifications for 3 months. At the end of the study, participants will complete a feasibility and acceptability questionnaire, and metrics regarding adherence and attrition will be calculated. Results: This trial opened for recruitment in November 2020. Data collection was completed in June 2021, and the primary results are expected to be published in 2022. Conclusions: This trial will determine the feasibility and acceptability of an intensive app-based intervention in 3 distinct care partner groups: care partners for persons with a chronic condition that was caused by a traumatic event (ie, spinal cord injury); care partners for persons with a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease (ie, Huntington disease); and care partners for persons with episodic cancer conditions that require intense, prolonged inpatient and outpatient treatment (persons with hematopoietic cell transplantation).",10.2196/32842,wos,"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",caregivers; quality of life; spinal cord injuries; Huntington disease; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; feasibility studies; self-management; mobile apps; outcome assessment; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/32842)
An App-Based Mindfulness-Based Self-compassion Program to Support Caregivers of People With Dementia: Participatory Feasibility Study,Not Multi User,"Goodridge, D; Reis, N; Neiser, J; Haubrich, T; Westberg, B; Erickson-Lumb, L; Storozinski, J; Gonzales, C; Michael, J; Cammer, A; Osgood, N",JMIR AGING,2021,"Background: The number of persons with dementia is steadily growing, as is the number of individuals supporting persons with dementia. Primary caregivers of persons with dementia are most often family members or spouses of the persons with dementia, and they are more likely to experience increased stress and other negative effects than individuals who are not primary caregivers. Although in-person support groups have been shown to help buffer the negative impacts of caregiving, some caregivers live in isolated or rural communities and are unable to make the burdensome commitment of traveling to cities. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we developed a mobile smartphone support app designed for primary caregivers of persons with dementia, with the goal of reducing caregiver burden and easing stress. The app features a 12-week intervention, largely rooted in mindfulness-based self-compassion (MBSC), because MBSC has been linked to minimizing stress, depression, and anxiety. Objective: The primary objectives of our program are twofold: to explore the feasibility of a 12-week mobile support program and to conduct an initial efficacy evaluation of changes in perceived caregiver burden, coping styles, and emotional well-being of caregivers before and after the program. Methods: Our feasibility study used a 2-phase participatory pretest and posttest design, focusing on acceptability, demand, practicality, implementation, and efficacy. At phase I, we recruited 57 primary caregivers of persons with dementia (mean age 76.3, SD 12.9 years), comprising spouses (21/57, 37%), children (21/57, 37%), and friends or relatives (15/57, 26%) of persons with dementia, of whom 29 (51%) completed all measures at both pre- and postprogram. The content of the program featured a series of MBSC podcasts. Our primary outcome measure was caregiver burden, with secondary outcome measures including coping styles and emotional well-being. Daily ecological momentary assessments enabled us to ask participants, How are you feeling today? Phase II of our study involved semistructured follow-up interviews with most participants (n=21) who completed phase I. Results: Our findings suggest that our app or program meets the feasibility criteria examined. Notably, participants generally accepted the program and believed it could be a useful resource. Emotional well-being increased significantly (P=.04), and emotion-based coping significantly decreased (P=.01). Participants generally considered the app or program to be a helpful resource. Conclusions: Although there were no significant changes in caregiver burden, we were encouraged by the increased emotional well-being of our participants following the completion of our program. We also conclude that our app or program demonstrated feasibility (ie, acceptability, practicality, implementation, and efficacy) and can provide a much-needed resource for primary caregivers of persons with dementia.

An Ecological Momentary Intervention for weight loss and healthy eating via smartphone and Internet: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Boh, B; Lemmens, LHJM; Jansen, A; Nederkoorn, C; Kerkhofs, V; Spanakis, G; Weiss, G; Roefs, A",TRIALS,2016,"Background: Long-term weight loss maintenance is difficult to achieve. Effectiveness of obesity interventions could be increased by providing extended treatment, and by focusing on person-environment interactions. Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) can account for these two factors by allowing an indefinite extension of a treatment protocol in everyday life. EMI relies on observations in daily life to intervene by providing appropriate in-the-moment treatment. The Think Slim intervention is an EMI based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and its effectiveness will be investigated in the current study. Methods: A randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted. At least 134 overweight adults (body mass index (BMI) above 25 kg/m(2)) will be randomly assigned to an 8-week immediate intervention group (Diet + Think Slim intervention, n = 67) or to an 8-week diet-only control group (followed by the Think Slim intervention, n = 67). The Think Slim intervention consists of (1) an app-based EMI that estimates and intervenes when people are likely to overeat, based on Ecological Momentary Assessment data, and (2) ten online computerised CBT sessions which work in conjunction with an EMI module in the app. The primary outcome is BMI. Secondary outcomes include (1) scores on self-report questionnaires for dysfunctional thinking, eating styles, eating disorder pathology, general psychological symptomatology, and self-esteem, and (2) eating patterns, investigated via network analysis. Primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained at pre- and post-intervention measurements, and at 3- and 12-month follow-up measurements.

Objective: We examined the effectiveness of an enhanced SMS text message-based support and reminder program in improving clinic attendance, metabolic control, engagement in self-management, and psychological health in young-onset type 2 diabetes. Methods: A 12-month, parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial comparing an enhanced, semipersonalized SMS text message-based intervention (incorporating 1-8 supportive and/or informative text messages per month) against standard care was conducted in a specialized clinic for young adult type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome was maintenance of 100% attendance at scheduled quarterly clinical appointments. Secondary outcomes included (1) metabolic indices, (2) pathology and self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) data availability, and (3) psychosocial well-being. Results: A total of 40 participants were randomized, and 32 completed their 12-month study visit. The average participant age was 32.7 (SD 5.1) years, 50% (20/40) were male, and baseline glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 7.3% (SD 1.9%) (56 mmol/mol, SD 20). A higher proportion of the intervention group achieved 100% attendance (12/21, 57%, vs 5/19, 26%, for the control group); Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly greater cumulative attendance in the intervention group (P=.04). There were no between-group differences in HbA1c, BMI, lipids, or availability of pathology and SMBG data.

An Examination of Individual and Organizational Theory in a Pilot Virtual Facilitated Learning Collaborative to Implement Written Exposure Therapy,Not mental health,"Worley, CB; Rosen, CS; LoSavio, ST; Aajmain, ST; Stirman, SW; Sloan, DM",PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES,2023,"Impact Statement This study demonstrated the feasibility of a virtual training that recruited clinicians and their clinic leadership to implement written exposure therapy in Veterans Affairs clinics with support. Clinicians' attitudes toward intervention became more positive across the training and consultation, and patient outcomes were important in predicting perceptions of WET. These findings provide support for virtual clinic-based training with learning collaborative support involving clinicians and clinic leadership. Participant training alone is typically insufficient to ensure adoption of a new treatment. This study provides preliminary data on a pilot program that implemented written exposure therapy (WET) through a virtual facilitated learning collaborative (VFLC) that combined clinician training with implementation support. Ninety-five mental health clinicians from Veterans Health Administration clinics enrolled in the VFLC. Clinicians received 6 hr of training in WET plus weekly group consultation on training cases for 12-16 weeks. Clinic leaders participated in monthly group calls with facilitators to develop and track implementation plans, address barriers, and share resources. Clinicians completed the Perceived Characteristics of Intervention Scale and Implementation Climate Scale before training and after consultation, and the Intention Scale for providers after the program. Clinicians' positive perceptions of WET increased over time, t(85) = -8.80, p < .001, d = 0.95, and changes were moderated by how much reduction in symptoms their patients experienced, t(151) = -2.13, p = .035. The implementation climate for WET also improved over time, t(85) = -3.55, p < .001, d = 0.36. Consistent with the theory of planned behavior, clinicians' intention to continue using WET after training was influenced by their perceptions and attitudes about WET, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. The VFLC model was feasible and associated with increases in clinicians' and leaders' support for using WET. Patient outcomes predicted the amount of change in clinicians' perceptions about WET.",10.1037/ser0000698,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,written exposure therapy; implementation; learning collaborative,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1037/ser0000698)
An Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy App for People with Dementia and Carers: Results from a Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT),Not Multi User,"Rai, HK; Schneider, J; Orrell, M",CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING,2021,"Background: There is a lack of digital resources that support the cognition and quality of life (QoL) of people with dementia. The individual cognitive stimulation therapy application (iCST app) aims to provide cognitive stimulation and social interaction to people with dementia and carers through interactive touch-screen technology. This study set out to determine the feasibility of conducting a full-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with the iCST app. Methods: This was a single blind, feasibility RCT including people with mild to moderate dementia and their carers. Multiple trial components were assessed including recruitment and retention rates, intervention fidelity and usability, and acceptability of the outcome assessments which included measures of cognition and QoL. A sample of the intervention group was invited to a semi-structured post-trial interview to examine the experience of using the iCST app. Results: Sixty-one dyads were randomised to the iCST app (n = 31) or treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group (n = 30) for 11 weeks. In the iCST app group, 77% used the intervention for 20 minutes or more each week. Carers using the iCST app rated their QoL better at follow-up 2 compared to the TAU control group (EQ-5D, MD = 7.69, 95% CI = 2.32-13.06, p = 0.006). No significant differences were found on the other outcome measures. Conclusion: The iCST app was deemed usable and enjoyable. Most participants completed the activities more quickly than anticipated and did not have enough activities to continue using the app frequently. Expansion of the iCST app is needed to maintain engagement for longer. Findings indicate that computerised cognitive stimulation can be beneficial, and a large-scale RCT is feasible with modifications to trial components. The results are relevant to researchers, software developers, policy-makers, people with dementia and carers who are looking to be involved in such interventions.

An Integrated Approach to Improve Maternal Mental Health and Well-Being During the COVID-19 Crisis,Not Digital,"Shidhaye, R; Madhivanan, P; Shidhaye, P; Krupp, K",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2020,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruption of normal life across the globe, severely affecting the already vulnerable populations such as the pregnant women. Maternal mental health and well-being is a public health priority and the evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health status of pregnant women is gradually emerging. The findings of the recently published studies suggest that increased risk perception about contracting COVID-19, reduced social support, increase in domestic violence, disruption of antenatal care, and economic consequences of COVID-19 mitigation strategies can lead to adverse mental health outcomes in antenatal period. There is a significant increase in antenatal depression and anxiety since the onset of COVID-19 and social determinants of health (e.g., younger age, lower education, lower income) are associated with these poor outcomes. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to improve the mental health and well-being of pregnant women. Physical activity and/or mind-body interventions like yoga can be practiced as self-care interventions by pregnant women. Despite social distancing being the current norm, efforts should be made to strengthen social support. Evidence-based interventions for perinatal depression should be integrated within the health system and stepped, collaborative care using non-specialist health workers as key human resource be utilized to improve access to mental health services. Use of digital platforms and smartphone enabled delivery of services has huge potential to further improve the access to care. Most importantly, the COVID-19 related policy guidelines should categorically include maternal mental health and well-being as a priority area.",10.3389/fpsyt.2020.598746,wos,Psychiatry,pregnancy; maternal mental health; self-care (MeSH); social support (MeSH term); health system; COVID-19 pandemic,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.598746)

While there is methadone or buprenorphine harm-reduction treatment for heroin addicts, there is no drug treatment for addicts with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). Recently, non-medication treatment, such as the cue-elicited craving method integrated with biofeedback, has been widely used. Further, virtual reality (VR) is proposed to simulate an immersive virtual environment for cue-elicited craving in therapy. In this study, we developed a VR system equipped with flavor simulation for the purpose of inducing cravings for MUD patients in therapy. The VR system was integrated with multi-model sensors, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR) and eye tracking to measure various physiological responses from MUD patients in the virtual environment. The goal of the study was to validate the effectiveness of the proposed VR system in inducing the craving of MUD patients via the physiological data. Clinical trials were performed with 20 MUD patients and 11 healthy subjects. VR stimulation was applied to each subject and the physiological data was measured at the time of pre-VR stimulation and post-VR stimulation. A variety of features were extracted from the raw data of heart rate variability (HRV), GSR and eye tracking. The results of statistical analysis found that quite a few features of HRV, GSR and eye tracking had significant differences between pre-VR stimulation and post-VR stimulation in MUD patients but not in healthy subjects. Also, the data of post-VR stimulation showed a significant difference between MUD patients and healthy subjects. Correlation analysis was made and several features between HRV and GSR were found to be correlated. Further, several machine learning methods were applied and showed that the classification accuracy between MUD and healthy subjects at post-VR stimulation attained to 89.8%. In conclusion, the proposed VR system was validated to effectively induce the drug craving in MUD patients.",10.1109/TBME.2021.3058805,wos,Engineering,Drugs; Multiuser detection; Electrocardiography; Gaze tracking; Sensors; Medical treatment; Physiology; Methamphetamine; virtual reality (VR); machine learning; Heart Rate Variability (HRV); electrocardiogram (ECG); Galvanic Skin Response (GSR); eye tracking,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2021.3058805)

Criteria for determining feasibility were (a) enrollment, (b) engagement, (c) acceptability, and (d) improvement on measures of self-esteem, depression, self-efficacy, and social support. Results: We attained our enrollment goal and engagement exceeded expectations. Acceptability was positive; participants gave helpful and enjoyable ratings of 3.21 and 3.27, respectively, (mean on a 1 to 4 Likert scale, where 4 = high) to 5 intervention components-session materials, group sharing and discussion, relaxation exercises, action planning, and group excursions.

The GROw program is organized sequentially in eight modules, and it is based on the dual-process model of coping with bereavement. Evaluations included a pre-to-post treatment assessment of depression, grief symptoms, and typical grief beliefs, along with daily measures of symptom frequency and intensity on the Emotional Monitor App. Treatment opinions and adherence to the App were also collected. Efficacy data were calculated using a Nonoverlap of All Pairs (NAP) analysis and Reliable Change Index (RCI). The mean age of the sample was 29.5 years (SD = 8.19). Two participants dropped out of the study. Adherence to the App varied across patients (4.8 %-77.8 %). Most participants (75 %) showed a clinically significant change (recovered) in depression, and 50 % obtained a clinically significant improvement (recovered) in symptoms of loss and typical beliefs in complicated grief. The participants reported high usability and satisfaction with the treatment content and format. In sum, the GROw program was very well accepted and generally feasible, and it has strong potential for treating PGD. The results support scaling up the treatment by using more complex designs with larger samples (i.e., randomized controlled trials comparing GROw with active conditions).",10.1016/j.invent.2022.100558,wos,Psychology; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Psychiatry,iCBT; Internet-delivered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy; Prolonged Grief Disorder; App; Multiple-baseline single-case design,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2022.100558)

An Investigation of the Effect of Virtual Reality on Alleviating Anxiety in Patients With Breast Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Shin, J; Chang, JS; Kim, JS; An, JY; Chung, SY; Yoon, SY; Kim, YB",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS,2023,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the anxiety-reducing effects of virtual reality (VR) on patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy (RT).Methods and Materials: This randomized controlled trial was conducted among patients with breast cancer receiving RT at a single institution. Of 196 enrolled and randomized patients, 97 were assigned to a VR explanation group (intervention) and 99 were assigned to the standard-of-care group (control). Anxiety levels were measured using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS) as the primary endpoint and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Linear Analogue Scale Assessment (LASA) as secondary endpoints. Knowledge of the RT procedure, patient satisfaction, and time spent for counseling were also assessed.Results: Intervention significantly reduced patient anxiety immediately, not only on the primary endpoint, APAIS, but also on the STAI and LASA anxiety scales. Specifically, in the intervention group, there were immediate reductions of 26.0%, 16.1%, and 55.8% for APAIS, STAI, and LASA, respectively, whereas in the control group, the respective reductions were 8.1%, 8.5%, and 13.7%. Among the 3 anxiety scales, long-term anxiety reduction was observed only when anxiety was measured by LASA. Subgroup analyses showed that the effect on anxiety did not differ based on the physician, baseline anxiety level, use of hormone therapy, or health literacy. The intervention also significantly improved knowledge of the RT procedure (81.9/100 vs 76.8/100; P = .006) and patient satisfaction with the explanation manner (6.56 vs 5.72; P < .001) compared with the control group.Conclusions: Immersive VR applied to the current procedure reduces anxiety during RT planning for patients with breast cancer.

Effective treatments exist, but they are time -and resource-intensive. This study tested the initial efficacy and acceptability of a novel treatment protocol designed to increase efficiency: acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) taught in groups and through an adjunctive mobile app. Participants were 21 individuals with GAD who received six weeks of 2-hour group ACT sessions as well as access to an adjunctive ACT mobile app. Significant improvements occurred in worry, anxiety, social functioning, and depression as well as relevant processes (psychological inflexibility, anxiety-related cognitive fusion). In-the-moment improvements were also observed in symptoms and ACT processes immediately after completing mobile app sessions. Treatment was perceived as credible and acceptable overall. However, rates of reliable and clinically significant change were low, and app usage did not correlate with change in worry. Overall, this study suggests that an efficient, briefACT group intervention combined with a mobile app may lead to improvements in GAD but may not be sufficient for clinically significant change.

Social support has an important role in successful weight loss. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an app-, web- and social support-based intervention in supporting adults with obesity to achieve weight loss.

Methods
The intervention and evaluation methods were tested in a feasibility randomised controlled trial. Adults in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area of Scotland with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2 were recruited and randomised 2:1 (intervention to control). The feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial methods were assessed against pre-specified progression criteria, via process, economic and outcome evaluation. Three primary outcomes were explored: BMI, diet and physical activity, as well as a number of secondary outcomes. The intervention group had access to the HelpMeDoIt! intervention for 12 months. This encouraged them to (i) set goals, (ii) monitor progress and (iii) harness social support by inviting ‘helpers’ from their existing social network. The control group received a healthy lifestyle leaflet.

Results
One hundred and nine participants were recruited, with 84 participants (77%) followed-up at 12 months. The intervention and trial methods were feasible and acceptable. Participants and helpers were generally positive. Of the 54 (74%) participants who downloaded the app, 48 (89%) used it. Interview data indicated that HelpMeDoIt! promoted social support from existing social networks to support weight loss. This support was often given outside of the app.

Outcomes were compared using linear regression models, with randomised group, the baseline measurement of the outcome, age and gender as predictor variables. These analyses were exploratory and underpowered to detect effects. However, all pre-specified primary outcome effects (BMI, diet and physical activity) had wide confidence intervals and were therefore consistent with clinically relevant benefits. Objective physical activity measures perhaps showed most potential (daily step count (p = 0.098; 1187 steps [− 180, 2555])) and sedentary time (p = 0.022; − 60.8 min [− 110.5, − 11.0]). However, these outcomes were poorly completed.

Conclusions
The study demonstrated that a novel social support intervention involving support from participants’ close social networks, delivered via app and website, has potential to promote weight loss and is feasible and acceptable.",10.3310/phr08030,pubmed,NA,"Digital health

An app-based training for adolescents with problematic digital-media use and their parents (Res@t digital): protocol for a cluster-randomized clinical trial,Not mental health,"Paschke, K; Diestelkamp, S; Zapf, A; Busch, K; Arnaud, N; Prehn-Kristensen, A; Reis, O; Stark, M; Cloes, JO; Schulz, AL; Brauer, H; Krömer, T; Thomasius, R",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2024,"Background Digital media-use disorders (DMUD) in adolescents are a rising phenomenon associated with psychological distress, comorbid mental disorders, and high burden on affected families. Since the ICD-11 introduced criteria for gaming disorder, these can now be transferred to describe additional DMUD associated with social media platforms and streaming services. Most evidence for effective treatments comes from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). However, interventions based on theoretical models for adolescents and their parents are widely missing, leading to a significant clinical gap. Methods Res@t digital (Resource-Strengthening Training for Adolescents with Problematic Digital-Media Use and their Parents) is the app-based translation of the first model-based digital intervention for adolescents with DMUD and their parents based on CBT. It comprises separate but content-related modules for adolescents (Res@t-A) and parents (Res@t-P), applying multimodal techniques. The effectiveness of Res@t will be evaluated within a multicenter cluster-randomized controlled evaluator-blinded pre-post follow-up trial with the waitlist control group (CG). In addition to the Res@t program in the intervention group, both groups will receive treatment as usual within primary child and adolescent psychiatric/psychotherapeutic healthcare. The primary outcome addresses DMUD symptom reduction after 10 weeks. Secondary outcomes are related to a reduction in psychological and family-related problems and an increase in parental self-efficacy. All outcomes will be assessed using standardized self-report measures. A total of 1,334 participating adolescent-parent dyads from a large clinical network throughout Germany are planned to be included in the primary analyses based on an intention-to-treat approach, applying linear mixed models. Discussion Assuming superiority of Res@t over the control condition, the intervention has the potential to provide evidence-based treatment for a significant number of help-seeking families, supporting local healthcare structures and resources. It is a promising program for practicable implementation and flexible use in different settings.

An assessment of early Child Life Therapy pain and anxiety management: A prospective randomised controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Hyland, EJ; D'Cruz, R; Harvey, JG; Moir, J; Parkinson, C; Holland, AJA",BURNS,2015,"Introduction: Burns remain extremely painful and distressing in young children. The consequences of poorly managed pain and anxiety can be life-long. Whilst Child Life Therapy (CLT) has been shown to be effective in many situations, few studies have looked at the effectiveness of CLT in regard to reducing pain and anxiety in children undergoing burn dressing changes. Methods: A prospective, randomised controlled trial was conducted, comparing CLT versus standard care in relation to pain and anxiety scores of children undergoing their initial burn dressing change. Pain and anxiety were assessed by an independent observer and questionnaires completed by the child, parent/caregiver and nursing staff. Results: 50 subjects were recruited in each treatment group; median age 2.3 years (CLT) and 2.2 years (standard care). The median total body surface area (TBSA) burnt was 0.8% (CLT) and 0.5% (standard care). The majority were partial thickness dermal burns (88% CLT, 94% standard care). Rates of parent anxiety and pre-procedural child pain and anxiety were similar. Combined and scaled pain and anxiety scores in the CLT group were significantly less than in the standard treatment group (p = 0.03). Whilst pain was significantly better in the CLT group (p = 0.02), fear scores, wound outcomes and the need for skin grafting were not statistically different in either group. Conclusions: The presence of a Child Life Therapist, with their ability to adapt to the environment, the child and their family, significantly reduced the experience of pain during paediatric burn dressings.

The effects of applying a smartphone app with structured education on glycemic control in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are unclear. A digital, culturally tailored structured education program was developed in a smartphone app (Yi tang yun qiao) to provide an automated, individualized education program aimed at improving self-management skills in patients with T1DM in China. This trial aims to investigate the effectiveness of this smartphone app among Chinese T1DM patients.Methods and analysisThis single-blinded, 24-week, parallel-group randomized controlled trial of a smartphone app versus routine care will be conducted in Changsha, China. We plan to recruit 138 patients with T1DM who will be randomly allocated into the intervention group (automated, individualized education through an app) or routine care group. The intervention will last for 24weeks. The primary outcome will be the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to week 24. The secondary outcomes will include time in range, fasting blood glucose, levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass index, quality of life, diabetes self-care activities, diabetes self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, and patient satisfaction. Adverse events will be formally documented. Data analysis will be conducted using the intention-to-treat principle with appropriate univariate and multivariate methods. Missing data will be imputed with a multiple imputation method under the missing at random assumption.DiscussionThis trial will investigate the effectiveness of an app-based automated structured education intervention for Chinese patients with T1DM.

To provide support during these times, Canada's largest mental health and addiction teaching hospital (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health [CAMH]) launched the Mental Health and COVID-19 Pandemic website on March 18, 2020. This website was designed to be a nonstigmatizing psychoeducational resource for people experiencing mild to moderate distress due to COVID-19 and the public health response to the pandemic. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the reach, usability, and user perceptions of the CAMH Mental Health and COVID-19 Pandemic web site. Methods: This study used a mixed methods sequential explanatory design approach, which consisted of the following 2 distinct phases: (1) quantitative data collection and analysis and (2) qualitative semistructured interviews. In phase 1, we analyzed Google Analytics data to understand how many people visited the website and which were the most visited pages. We conducted a survey to identify users' sociodemographic backgrounds, and assess the usability of the website using the System Usability Scale and users' subjective stress levels using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). For phase 2, we conducted semistructured interviews to explore user experiences; user motivation, engagement, satisfaction, and perception of the stress reduction strategies; reflections of the website's functionality, ease of use, navigation, and design; and recommendations for improvement. Results: Google Analytics results showed 146,978 unique users from June 2020 to March 2021. Most users were from Canada (130,066, 88.5%). Between February 20, 2021, and June 4, 2021, 152 users completed the survey. Most users identified as white, female, and having at least a college degree. Based on the PSS-10 scores, most participants were experiencing moderate to high stress when they visited the website. Users rated the usability of the website as acceptable. Ten users completed in-depth interviews between May 2021 and June 2021. Positive feedback related to the content was that the website was a trustworthy source of mental health information with helpful evidence-based stress reduction strategies. Areas for improvement included the text heavy design of the website, wider dissemination/marketing, and greater accessibility of the website to meet the needs of diverse populations. Conclusions: Adding stress reduction resources to a website from a well-respected institution may be a practical method to increase awareness and access to evidence-based stress reduction resources during times of crisis, where there is severe disruption to usual health care contacts.

An e-Prehabilitation System of Care for Teenagers and Young Adults Diagnosed With Cancer: Protocol for a Qualitative Co-Design Study,Not Multi User,"McCann, L; McMillan, KA; Hewitt, C",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2018,"Background: A diagnosis of cancer in young adulthood can pose many different and unique challenges for individuals. The provision of adequate and appropriate information as well as care and support for teenagers and young adults at the time of diagnosis is central to their health care experience going forward. Moreover, appropriate and accessible information provision is critical to ensure that young individuals with cancer feel equipped and empowered to make decisions about, and be involved in, their treatment and recovery throughout their experience; this is a concept known as prehabilitation. As digital interventions and resources that support teenagers and young adults with cancer are an increasingly desirable part of health care provision, this study will focus on the development of an age- and population-appropriate electronic prehabilitation (e-Prehabilitation) system of care. Objective: We will conduct an exploratory, co-design research project that will inform the development of an e-Prehabilitation system of care to support teenagers and young adults diagnosed with cancer. A collaborative approach to data collection and prototype design will ensure that a patient-centered approach is embedded throughout. Methods: A qualitative, co-design study utilizing surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions is being conducted with teenagers and young adults, health care professionals, and technologists.

Patient engagement is an essential prerequisite to any treatment benefits, but previous research has not investigated engagement with psychological group treatments. In this service evaluation, we compared patients who initially engaged and disengaged from an online CBT-based group treatment on demographic and clinical variables, and illness-related beliefs. A self-report survey was used to explore reasons for disengagement. Of 64 patients invited to the group treatment, 39 (60.1%) disengaged before the first session. Older age was associated with engagement with the functional seizures group. There were no other group differences between demographic, clinical, or belief-based variables. Patients who disengaged reported the timing and format as barriers to joining and had preferences for individual and in-person interventions. These findings have implications for the role of clinicians in providing regular tangible information about referral pathways, and motivating patients to engage with available treatments.

Hence, an innovative digitally driven and modular-based 1-year primary care psychiatry program (PCPP) was designed and implemented exclusively for practicing PCDs of Uttarakhand. Aim: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of this digitally driven 1-year PCPP on the general practice of PCDs. Materials and Methods: Ten PCDs were trained in the curriculum module Clinical Schedule for Primary Care Psychiatry which is a validated concise guideline for screening, classification, diagnosis, treatment, follow-ups, and referrals. Furthermore, they underwent training in on-site basic module (10 days); three online modules (with nil or minimal disruption in their regular clinical work) - Telepsychiatric On-Consultation Training (Tele-OCT), Collaborative Video Consultations, and weekly virtual classroom; and one public health module. In addition, PCDs underwent 10 criteria-based formative assessment including self-reports of weekly patients' audit (Primary Care Psychiatry Quotient [PCPQ]) and quarterly Tele-OCT evaluation sessions (Translational Quotient [TQ]). Results: PCPQ was 11.09% (2182 psychiatric patients of total 19,670 general outpatients) which means 11.09% of PCDs' total general consultations had psychiatric disorders, which would have been otherwise missed.

Analysis of Online Peripartum Depression Communities: Application of Multilabel Text Classification Techniques to Inform Digitally-Mediated Prevention and Management,Good,"Zingg, A; Singh, T; Myneni, S",FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH,2021,"Peripartum depression (PPD) is a significant public health problem, yet many women who experience PPD do not receive adequate treatment. In many cases, this is due to social stigmas surrounding PPD that prevent women from disclosing their symptoms to their providers. Examples of these are fear of being labeled a bad mother, or having misinformed expectations regarding motherhood. Online forums dedicated to PPD can provide a practical setting where women can better manage their mental health in the peripartum period. Data from such forums can be systematically analyzed to understand the technology and information needs of women experiencing PPD. However, deeper insights are needed on how best to translate information derived from online forum data into digital health features. In this study, we aim to adapt a digital health development framework, Digilego, toward translation of our results from social media analysis to inform digital features of a mobile intervention that promotes PPD prevention and self-management. The first step in our adaption was to conduct a user need analysis through semi-automated analysis of peer interactions in two highly popular PPD online forums: What to Expect and BabyCenter. This included the development of a machine learning pipeline that allowed us to automatically classify user post content according to major communication themes that manifested in the forums. This was followed by mapping the results of our user needs analysis to existing behavior change and engagement optimization models. Our analysis has revealed major themes being discussed by users of these online forums- family and friends, medications, symptom disclosure, breastfeeding, and social support in the peripartum period. Our results indicate that Random Forest was the best performing model in automatic text classification of user posts, when compared to Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression models. Computerized text analysis revealed that posts had an average length of 94 words, and had a balance between positive and negative emotions. Our Digilego-powered theory mapping also indicated that digital platforms dedicated to PPD prevention and management should contain features ranging from educational content on practical aspects of the peripartum period to inclusion of collaborative care processes that support shared decision making, as well as forum moderation strategies to address issues with cyberbullying.",10.3389/fdgth.2021.653769,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,digital health; peripartum; mental health; machine learning; social media,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2021.653769)

Analyzing the Impact of Mobile App Engagement on Mental Health Outcomes: Secondary Analysis of the Unwinding Anxiety Program,Not Multi User,"Nardi, W; Roy, A; Dunsiger, S; Brewer, J",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2022,"Background: App-based interventions provide a promising avenue for mitigating the burden on mental health services by complimenting therapist-led treatments for anxiety. However, it remains unclear how specific systems' use of app features may be associated with changes in mental health outcomes (eg, anxiety and worry). Objective: This study was a secondary analysis of engagement data from a stage 1 randomized controlled trial testing the impact of the Unwinding Anxiety mobile app among adults with generalized anxiety disorder. The aims of this study were 2-fold: to investigate whether higher microengagement with the primary intervention feature (ie, educational modules) is associated with positive changes in mental health outcomes at 2 months (ie, anxiety, worry, interoceptive awareness, and emotional reactivity) and to investigate whether the use of adjunctive app features is also associated with changes in mental health outcomes. Methods: We analyzed the intervention group during the stage 1 trial of the Unwinding Anxiety mobile app. The total use of specific mobile app features and the use specific to each feature were calculated. We used multivariate linear models with a priori significance of alpha=.05 to investigate the impact of cumulative app use on anxiety, worry, interoceptive awareness, and emotional regulation at 2 months, controlling for baseline scores, age, and education level in all models. Significant relationships between system use metrics and baseline participant characteristics were assessed for differences in use groupings using between-group testing (ie, 2-tailed t tests for continuous data and chi-square analyses for categorical data). Results: The sample was primarily female (25/27, 93%), and the average age was 42.9 (SD 15.6) years. Educational module completion, the central intervention component, averaged 20.2 (SD 11.4) modules out of 32 for the total sample. Multivariate models revealed that completing >75% of the program was associated with an average 22.6-point increase in interoceptive awareness (b=22.6; SE 8.32; P=.01; 95% CI 5.3-39.8) and an 11.6-point decrease in worry (b=-11.6; SE 4.12; P=.01; 95% CI -20.2 to -3.1). In addition, a single log unit change in the total number of meditations was associated with a 0.62-point reduction in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale scores (b=0.62; SE 0.27; P=.005; 95% CI -1.2 to -0.6), whereas a single log unit use of the stress meter was associated with an average of a 0.5-point increase in emotional regulation scores (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire; b=0.5; SE 0.21; P=.03; 95% CI 0.1-0.9). Conclusions: This study offers a clearer understanding of the impact of engagement with app features on broader engagement with the health outcomes of interest.

Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: a systematic review and digital tool development,Not Multi User,"Pillinger, T; Howes, OD; Correll, CU; Leucht, S; Huhn, M; Schneider-Thoma, J; Gaughran, F; Jauhar, S; Mcguire, PK; Taylor, DM; Young, AH; Mccutcheon, RA",LANCET PSYCHIATRY,2023,"Background Side -effects of psychiatric medication impair quality of life and functioning. Furthermore, they contribute to morbidity, mortality, stigma, and poor treatment concordance resulting in relapse of psychiatric illness. Guidelines recommend discussing side -effects with patients when making treatment decisions, but a synthesis of antidepressant and antipsychotic side -effects to guide this process is missing, and considering all side -effects is a complex, multidimensional process. We aimed to create comprehensive databases of antipsychotic and antidepressant sideeffects, and a digital tool to support database navigation. Methods To create the databases, we did an umbrella review of Embase, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE from database inception to June 26, 2023. We included meta -analyses of randomised controlled trials examining antipsychotic monotherapy in the treatment of schizophrenia or antidepressant monotherapy in the treatment of major depressive disorder. We included meta -analyses in adults (aged >= 18 years) that assessed drugs with a common comparator. The search was complemented by a review of national and international guidelines and consensus statements for the treatment of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia in adults. Effect sizes for antipsychotic and antidepressant side -effects were extracted from meta -analyses examining the largest number of drugs. In cases of incomplete metaanalytic coverage, data were imputed on the basis of guideline -derived ordinal rankings or, if imputation was not possible, ordinal scores were extracted. Both meta -analytic and ordinal outcomes were normalised to provide values between 0 and 1. We then constructed a digital tool, the Psymatik Treatment Optimizer, to combine the side -effect databases with side -effect concerns of an individual user, to enable users to select side -effects of concern and the relative degree of concern for each side -effect. Concern weightings and the side -effect databases are synthesised via a multicriteria decision analysis method (technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal situation, or TOPSIS). Findings Of 3724 citations, 14 articles containing 68 meta -analyses of individual side -effects met inclusion criteria. After review of 19 guidelines, seven provided ordinal data. Antipsychotic data were extracted from five studies (11 meta -analyses, n=65 594 patients) and four guidelines, and antidepressant data were extracted from three guidelines. The resultant databases included data on 32 antipsychotics (14 side -effects) and 37 antidepressants (nine side -effects). The databases highlighted the clinical dilemma associated with balancing side -effects, with avoidance of one side -effect (eg, weight gain for antipsychotics) increasing the risk of others (eg, akathisia). To aid with this dilemma, the Psymatik Treatment Optimizer synthesises the side -effect databases with individual user -defined concern weights. After computing up to 5851 pairwise comparisons for antidepressants and 5142 pairwise comparisons for antipsychotics, Psymatik ranks treatments in order of preference for the individual user, with the output presented in a heatmap. Interpretation By facilitating collaborative, personalised, and evidence -based prescribing decisions, the side -effect databases and digital application supports care delivery that is consistent with international regulatory guidance for the treatment of schizophrenia and depression, and it therefore has promise for informing psychiatric practice and improving outcomes.

Anxiolytic effects of silibinin and naringenin on zebrafish model: A preclinical study,Not mental health,"Nachammai, V; Jeyabalan, S; Muthusamy, S",INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Stress exacerbates the pathophysiology of major neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, the zebrafish (Danio rerio), the frequently used model for experimental studies of stress and other central nervous system disorders, was used to evaluate the anxiolytic potential of flavonoids, namely silibinin and naringenin on alleviating acute stress-induced anxiety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A molecular docking study with Molegro Virtual Docker software was done to assess the binding potential of flavonoids on serotonin and dopamine receptors. To determine the bioactivity and investigate the toxicity of the flavonoids, silibinin, and naringenin, brine shrimp lethality assay, and an acute toxicity study was conducted according to Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Test Guideline 203. The effect of silibinin and naringenin was assessed using behavioral tasks such as the novel tank assay and the light-dark test on the zebrafish model of acute stress. RESULTS: Molecular docking studies showed a higher affinity of silibinin and naringenin for the serotonin and dopamine receptors. In comparison to the LC50 value, 13.15 mu g/ml of the reference standard potassium dichromate, silibinin, and naringenin yielded higher LC50 values, 34.10 mu g/ml and 91.33 mu g/ml, respectively. The LC50 value of silibinin and naringenin was observed to be >100 mg/l from the acute toxicity study on adult zebrafish. After transferring to a novel tank, silibinin and naringenin-treated zebrafish groups were found to explore the upper level of the tank, similar to standard drugs, and spent a long time in the upper level of the tank compared to the control group (p < 0.01). Both silibinin and naringenin treatment group spent increased amounts of time in the tank's illuminated part in contrast to that of the dark side as evidenced by the number of zebrafish entering or remaining in the illuminated part of the tank through the light-dark test. Silibinin and naringenin treated groups were found to spend increased time in the light side significantly on the day 15th of evaluation as compared to the control group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The flavonoids, silibinin, and naringenin were found to mitigate acute stress-induced anxiety, owing to their anxiolytic properties in the zebrafish model and may be explored as the potential therapeutic agents for treating anxiety.",10.4103/ijp.IJP_18_20,"pubmed, wos",Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Anxiety; behaviour; flavonoids; stress; zebrafish,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.4103/ijp.IJP_18_20)
App-Based Intervention for Female Orgasmic Disorder in Emjoy: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Vila, A; Parunella, M; Sansoni, M",ANNUAL REVIEW OF CYBERTHERAPY AND TELEMEDICINE,2023,"It is estimated that 40-45% of adults worldwide have had or will have a sexual problem. Psychosexual treatments are considered effective and yet female untreated rates are high. E-mental health, specifically apps, might be a solution. Therefore, it becomes interesting to design and test the efficacy of an app-based intervention for female orgasm disorder ( FOD) adapted to be administered in Emjoy (i.e., an app focused on female sexual health). To achieve this goal, 16 women diagnosed with FOD followed and finished an 8-week app-based intervention program: 8 women were part of the app intervention group, and 8 were part of a minimum therapeutic contact control group. The intervention consisted in a total of 275 minutes of audio-guided exercises planned to treat every item relevant to their disorder, and included different techniques, such as psychosexual education, cognitive restructuring, and sexual stimulation. The means between groups were compared with an ANOVA, and significant between-group differences were found in Sexual Satisfaction, Function, and Anxiety, favoring intervention. Participants declared to be very satisfied with both the outcomes of the intervention and the treatment itself. Even if research is still needed, this app- based intervention using Emjoy seems to be effective in improving some of the variables which may be related to the maintenance of FOD. To our knowledge, this is the first app-based intervention that focus solely on female sexual health, and even though it cannot replace therapy, it appears as an interesting way to help women in reaching for help that, otherwise, they would not seek.",NA,wos,Computer Science,App-based intervention; Sexual disorder; Mobile application; Trial; Randomized,URI::(https://www.doi.org/NA)
App-Based Mindfulness Meditation Training and an Audiobook Intervention Reduce Symptom Severity but Do Not Modify Backward Inhibition in Adolescent Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Evidence from an EEG Study,Other,"Rempel, S; Backhausen, LL; McDonald, M; Roessner, V; Vetter, NC; Beste, C; Wolff, N",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,2023,"(1) Background: 1-2% of children and adolescents are affected by Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The rigid, repetitive features of OCD and an assumed disability to inhibit recent mental representations are assumed to have led to a paradoxical advantage in that the Backward Inhibition (BI) effect was recently found to be lower in adolescents with OCD as compared to healthy controls. It was hypothesized that app-based mindfulness meditation training could reduce the disability to inhibit recent mental representations and thus increase the BI-effect by adapting cognitive flexibility and inhibition abilities according to healthy controls. (2) Methods: 58 adolescents (10-19 years) with OCD were included in the final sample of this interviewer-blind, randomized controlled study. Participants were allocated to an intervention group (app-based mindfulness meditation training) or an (active) control group (app-based audiobook) for eight weeks. Symptom (CY-BOCS), behavioral (reaction times and mean accuracy), and neurophysiological changes (in EEG) of the BI-effect were analyzed in a pre-post design. (3) Results: The intervention and the control group showed an intervention effect (Reliable Change Index: 67%) with a significant symptom reduction. Contrary to the hypothesis, the BI-effect did not differ between pre vs. post app-based mindfulness meditation training. In addition, as expected the audiobook application showed no effects. Thus, we observed no intervention-specific differences with respect to behavioral (reaction times and mean accuracy) or with respect to neurophysiological (perceptual [P1], attentional [N1], conflict monitoring [N2] or updating and response selection [P3]) processes. However, in an exploratory approach, we revealed that the BI-effect decreased in participants who did not benefit from using an app, regardless of group. (4) Conclusions: Both listening to an app-based mindfulness meditation training and to an audiobook reduce symptom severity in adolescent OCD as measured by the CY-BOCS; however, they have no specific effect on BI. The extent of the baseline BI-effect might be considered as an intra-individual component to predict the benefit of both mindfulness meditation training and listening to an audiobook.",10.3390/jcm12072486,"pubmed, wos",General & Internal Medicine,adolescents; app; backward inhibition; EEG; intervention; OCD; mindfulness meditation,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3390/jcm12072486)
App-Based Mindfulness Meditation for People of Color Who Experience Race-Related Stress: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Other,"Ramos, G; Aguilera, A; Montoya, A; Lau, A; Wen, CY; Torres, VC; Chavira, D",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2022,"Background: People of color (POC) who experience race-related stress are at risk of developing mental health problems, including high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Mindfulness meditation may be especially well suited to help POC cope, given its emphasis on gaining awareness and acceptance of emotions associated with discriminatory treatment. However, mindfulness meditation rarely reaches POC, and digital approaches could reduce this treatment gap by addressing traditional barriers to care. Objective: This study will test the effectiveness of a self-directed app-based mindfulness meditation program among POC who experience elevated levels of race-related stress. Implementation outcomes such as treatment acceptability, adherence, and satisfaction will be examined. Methods: Participants (n=80) will be recruited online by posting recruitment materials on social media and sending emails to relevant groups. In-person recruitment will consist of posting flyers in communities with significant POC representation. Eligible participants will be block randomized to either the intervention group (n=40) that will complete a self-directed 4-week mindfulness meditation program or a wait-list control condition (n=40) that will receive access to the app after study completion. All participants will complete measures at baseline, midtreatment, and posttreatment. Primary outcomes include changes in stress, anxiety, and depression, and secondary outcomes constitute changes in mindfulness, self-compassion, rumination, emotion suppression, and experiential avoidance. Exploratory analyses will examine whether changes in the secondary outcomes mediate changes in primary outcomes. Finally, treatment acceptability, adherence, and satisfaction will be examined descriptively. Results: Recruitment began in October 2021. Data will be analyzed using multilevel modeling, a statistical methodology that accounts for the dependence among repeated observations. Considering attrition issues in self-directed digital interventions and their potential effects on statistical significance and treatment effect sizes, we will examine data using both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this will be the first study to provide data on the effectiveness of a self-directed app-based mindfulness meditation program for POC recruited based on elevated race-related stress, a high-risk population. Similarly, meaningful clinical targets for POC affected by stressors related to race will be examined.

App-based intervention among adolescents with persistent pain: a pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial,Not mental health,"Grasaas, E; Helseth, S; Fegran, L; Stinson, J; Småstuen, M; Lalloo, C; Haraldstad, K",PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES,2022,"Background: Persistent pain in adolescence adversely affects everyday life and is an important public health problem. The primary aim was to determine the feasibility of an 8-week app-based self-management intervention to reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life in a community-based population of adolescents with persistent pain. A secondary aim was to explore differences in health outcomes between the intervention and control groups. Methods: A sample of 73 adolescents aged 16-19 years with persistent pain from a community-based population were randomized into 2 groups. The intervention group received the Norwegian culturally adapted version of the iCanCope with Pain (TM) app, which includes symptom tracking, goal setting, self-management strategies, and social support. The attention control group received a symptom tracking app. Feasibility was assessed as attrition rates and level of engagement (interactions with the app). The secondary outcomes included pain intensity, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, pain self-efficacy, perceived social support from friends, anxiety and depression, and patient global impression. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS. Results: Demographic and baseline outcome variables did not differ between the 2 groups. No differences were found between the participants completing the study and those who withdrew. Twenty-eight adolescents completed the intervention as planned (62% attrition). Both groups had a low level of app engagement. Intention-to-treat analysis (n = 19 + 14) showed no significant differences in outcomes between groups. However, the large effect size (Cohen's d = .9) for depression suggested a lower depression score in the intervention group.

While effective inpatient and aftercare treatment options exist, the transferal of treatment success into everyday life is challenging and many patients remain without further assistance. App-based interventions with human guidance have great potential to support individuals after inpatient treatment, yet evidence on their efficacy remains scarce. Objectives: To develop an app-based intervention with human guidance and evaluate its usability, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. Methods: Individuals with alcohol use disorder (DSM-5), aged 18 or higher, without history of schizophrenia, undergoing inpatient alcohol use disorder treatment (N = 356) were recruited in eight medical centres in Bavaria, Germany, between December 2019 and August 2021. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive access to treatment as usual plus an app-based intervention with human guidance (intervention group) or access to treatment as usual plus app-based intervention after the active study phase (waitlist control/ TAU group). Telephone-based assessments are conducted by diagnostic interviewers three and six weeks as well as three and six months after randomization. The primary outcome is the relapse risk during the six months after randomization assessed via the Timeline Follow-Back Interview. Secondary outcomes include intervention usage, uptake of aftercare treatments, AUD-related psychopathology, general psychopathology, and quality of life. Discussion: This study will provide further insights into the use of app-based interventions with human guidance as maintenance treatment in individuals with AUD. If shown to be efficacious, the intervention may improve AUD treatment by assisting individuals in maintaining inpatient treatment success after returning into their home setting. Due to the ubiquitous use of smartphones, the intervention has the potential to become part of routine AUD care in Germany and countries with similar healthcare systems.",10.1016/j.invent.2022.100517,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Psychiatry,Alcohol use disorder; App-based intervention; Human guidance; Maintenance treatment; RCT; Germany,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2022.100517)

Multidisciplinary pain treatment (MPT) programs comprising educational, physical, and psychological interventions have shown positive treatment effects on LBP. Nonetheless, such programs are costly and treatment opportunities are often limited to specialized medical centers. mHealth and other digital interventions may be a promising method to successfully support patient self-management in LBP. To address these issues, we investigated the clinical effects of a multidisciplinary mHealth back pain App (Kaia App) in a randomized controlled trial (registered at German Clinical Trials Register under DRKS00016329).

In the intervention group, the Kaia App was provided for 3 months. Control treatment consisted of six individual physiotherapy sessions over 6 weeks and high-quality online education. The primary outcome, pain intensity, was assessed at 12-week follow-up on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Our per-protocol analysis showed no significant differences between the groups at baseline (Kaia App group: M = 5.10 (SD = 1.07) vs. control group: M = 5.41 (SD = 1.15). At 12-week follow-up the Kaia App group reported significantly lower pain intensity (M = 2.70 (SD = 1.51)) compared to the control group (M = 3.40 (SD = 1.63)). Our results indicate that the Kaia App as a multidisciplinary back pain app is an effective treatment in LBP patients and is superior to physiotherapy in combination with online education.",10.1038/s41746-019-0109-x,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1038/s41746-019-0109-x)
App-enhanced transdiagnostic CBT for adolescents with mood or psychotic spectrum disorders,Good,"Weintraub, MJ; Ichinose, MC; Zinberg, J; Done, M; Morgan-Fleming, GM; Wilkerson, CA; Brown, RD; Bearden, CE; Miklowitz, DJ",JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,2022,"Background: Although transdiagnostic forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have been evaluated in individuals with depressive and anxiety disorders, few studies have examined their suitability for more severe disorders, such as recurrent or persistent major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or psychotic spectrum disorders. This study examined the acceptability and initial efficacy of an app-enhanced Unified Protocol for Adolescents [UP-A] when including youth with more severe mood disorders or psychotic spectrum disorders. Methods: We first adapted a mobile application (app), based on user-centered feedback from adolescents and their parents, to assist participants in reviewing session content, practicing skills learned in previous treatment sessions, and monitoring symptomatic progress. A total of 24 adolescents (M age = 15.2 years, SD = 1.6) with mood or psychotic spectrum disorders and their parents then participated in an open trial of the app-enhanced group treatment given over 9 weekly sessions. Results: Adolescent participants and their parents rated the group treatment and mobile app as acceptable and useful. We observed significant improvements over the 9-week treatment in adolescents' depressive symptoms, attenuated psychotic symptoms, and global functioning. The frequency with which adolescents used the mobile app between sessions was positively related to symptomatic and functional gains. Conclusions: Initial findings suggest the acceptability and feasibility of a mobile app that enabled adolescent participants and their parents to review session content and practice treatment skills. Findings also indicated improvements in psychiatric and functional outcomes among the adolescent participants over the course of the app-enhanced treatment.

Applicability of acceptance and commitment therapy-based mobile app in depression nursing,Not Multi User,"Kaipainen, K; Välkkynen, P; Kilkku, N",TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,2017,"Due to the high burden of depression, new models and methods of mental healthcare need to be developed. Prior research has shown the potential benefits of using technology tools such as mobile apps as self-help or combined with psychological treatment. Therefore, professionals should acquaint themselves with evidence-based apps to be able to use them with clients and guide the clients in their use. The purpose of this study was to explore how an acceptance and commitment therapy-based mobile app was perceived as a self-management tool among nurses, and how it could be applied in the prevention and treatment of depression and other mental health issues. Sixteen Finnish nurses undergoing depression nurse specialist education used the app for 5 weeks and participated in semistructured focus group interviews. Interviews were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. In general, the nurses found the app suitable as a self-management tool and identified three models of using it in clinical practice. Having used the app personally, the nurses were eager to take it into use with various client groups, especially in occupational health but also in the treatment of mental health problems. However, they also raised concerns about the effort needed in familiarizing oneself with the content and pointed out specific client groups for whom the benefits of the app should be carefully weighed against the potential risks. Despite the small sample size, the findings suggest that involving technology tools aspart of thenurses' education could ease their adoption in clinical practice. The degree of professional support in the app use should be aligned to the severity of the mental health problems.",10.1007/s13142-016-0451-3,wos,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Depression; Mobile app; mHealth; Acceptance and commitment therapy; Nurse education; Stepped care; Mental health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s13142-016-0451-3)
Application of Virtual Body Swapping to Patients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome: A Pilot Study,Not Multi User,"Jeon, B; Cho, S; Lee, JH",CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING,2014,"This study aimed to apply virtual body swapping through mental rehearsal for patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and to investigate whether it is applicable to them. Ten patients who met the diagnostic criterion for CRPS type 1 were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. All participants were asked to watch the virtual body swapping training video clip with a head mounted display. The treatment group was additionally asked to assume a posture similar to the body on the screen and rehearse the movements mentally, as if the body presented on the screen was their body. No difference between the groups was found for pain intensity, however, the treatment group showed significantly more improvement in body perception disturbance (BPD) after the treatment than the control group. Even if the presented study is a preliminary one, the above results suggest that virtual body swapping through mental rehearsal is applicable for patients with CRPS and may be useful for improving BPD.

However, access for this population to professional service providers is limited. Therefore, there is an increasing need for access to mental health services and new mental health care resources tailored to adolescents. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the functionality and effectiveness of a school digital mental health clinic (DMHC) created by a Chinese psychiatric hospital and provided to secondary school students for a trial. Methods: The trial period of the DMHC was from January to July 2021 at three secondary schools in Taizhou City, China. Under a collaborative agreement between the local educational bureau and provider, use of the DMHC was free to all students, teachers, and staff of the schools. The functionality of the DMHC was compared with existing digital health interventions introduced in the literature and its effectiveness was quantitatively analyzed in terms of the volume of received counseling calls, number of calls per 100 students, length and time of calls, and reasons for the calls. The mini course video views were analyzed by topics and viewing time. Results: The design functions of the DMHC are well aligned with required factors defined in the literature. The first advantage of this DMHC is its high accessibility to students in the three schools. All functions of the DMHC are free to use by students, thereby eliminating the economic barriers to seeking and receiving care. Students can receive virtual counseling during or after regular working hours. Acceptability of the DHMC was further ensured by the full support from a national top-tier mental health facility. Any audio or video call from a student user would connect them to a live, qualified professional (ie, a psychiatrist or psychologist). Options are provided to view and listen to resources for stress relief or tips to help address mental health needs. The major reasons for the counseling calls included difficulties in learning, interpersonal relationships, and emotional distress. The three topics with the highest level of interest for the mini course videos were emotional assistance, personal growth, and family member relationships. The DMHC served as an effective tool for crisis prevention and intervention during nonworking hours as most of the live calls and mini video viewing occurred after school or over the weekend. Furthermore, the DMHC helped three students at high risk for suicide and self-injury through live-call intervention. Conclusions: The DMHC is an effective complementary solution to improve access to professional mental health care facilities, especially during nonworking hours, thereby helping adolescents meet their mental health needs. Extension of the DMHC into more schools and other settings is recommended.",10.2196/46494,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,adolescents; digital mental health clinic; emotional distress; mental health service; secondary school,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/46494)
Application of a virtual reality prototype for pain relief of pediatric burn in Taiwan,Not Multi User,"Chan, EA; Chung, JWY; Wong, TKS; Lien, ASY; Yang, JY",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING,2007,"Aim. This study examines the usability and effectiveness of virtual reality in reducing pain in wound-care procedures for pediatric burn patients in Taiwan. Background. Virtual reality has continuously gained prominence in the medical arena, for instance, the telepresence for surgery, the management of mental health disorders and pain control of the paediatric burn. Notwithstanding an increased application of virtual reality in the medical arena in North America, there have been no studies investigating its use for paediatric burn patients in Asia. Methods. This descriptive study has two phases: Phase I: the development of a virtual reality prototype. Phase II: the implementation of the prototype to discern its usability and efficacy with paediatric burn patients at a local hospital. Results. The findings suggest that a significant difference is found in the children's reported pain, with or without the virtual reality intervention, over the three phases: before, during and after the dressing change. However, less pain was noted in the intervention group during and after the dressing change. Conclusion. Adding to the existing clinical value of virtual reality identifies the nature of and different children's responses to pain with the use of virtual reality. Relevance to clinical practice. This study is significant since it demonstrates a difference in the child's response to pain based on the nature of presence and distraction. Moreover, given the evidence that a decrease in anxiety was experienced after the dressing change with virtual reality intervention, timing of using the virtual reality intervention before the child develops conditioning anxiety and anticipated pain for the procedure would be of importance.",10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01719.x,"pubmed, wos",Nursing,nurses; nursing; pain and presence; pediatric burn; virtual reality; wound care,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01719.x)
Application of virtual reality technology combined with moderate perineal protection in natural childbirth,Not Multi User,"Xie, JQ; Zen, QX",GINEKOLOGIA POLSKA,2023,"Objectives: To explore the application effect of virtual reality (VR) combined with moderate perineal protection on singleton primipara delivery. Material and methods: The study utilised a two-group design intervention and a randomised clinical trial. A total of 200 singleton primiparas who had a regular prenatal examination in a third-class hospital (between 1 September 2018 and 30 December 2018) and were willing to give birth naturally were randomly divided into treatment (traditional prenatal health mission combined with desktop VR health education system mode) and control (traditional health education mode) groups. The delivery conditions of the two groups were surveyed, recorded, analysed and compared. Results: There was no significant difference in the time of the second stage of labour between the treatment and control groups, and the comparison of neonatal Apgar scores and neonatal weight between the two groups showed that the different modes of prenatal education had no effect on newborns (p > 0.05). The amount of postpartum haemorrhage in 2 h and the pain score in the treatment group were significantly lower than in the control group, and the degree of perineal injury in the treatment group was not as serious as that in the control group. Meanwhile, there was a statistically significant difference in the anxiety score, self-efficacy score and quality of life satisfaction between the treatment and control groups (p < 0.05).

Applying dyadic digital psychological interventions for reducing caregiver burden in the illness context: a systematic review and a meta-analysis protocol,Not Digital,"Semonella, M; Bertuzzi, V; Dekel, R; Andersson, G; Pietrabissa, G; Vilchinsky, N",BMJ OPEN,2023,"IntroductionProviding informal care to one's romantic partner who is ill may become a highly distressing and demanding task. Based on the innovative dyadic coping model, several support interventions have been developed to alleviate informal caregivers' burden, including both caregivers' and care receivers' needs. Considering the unique challenges characterising the caregiving phenomenon, such as geographical barriers and time restrictions, digital solutions should be considered. However, there is a lack of research examining the effectiveness of dyadic digital solutions. Thus, this review aims to examine the existing literature on the efficacy of dyadic digital psychological interventions designed for caregivers and their care-receivers couples within the illness context.Methods and analysisRandomised controlled trials targeting caregivers' burden among dyads of informal caregivers and care receivers will be identified via an electronic search of the following databases: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Cinhal, Scopus, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and supplemented by hand searching of previous systematic reviews. The search will be undertaken following the PICO (population, intervention, comparison and outcome) elements. If possible, a meta-analysis will be conducted to examine: (1) the effectiveness of dyadic digital psychological interventions for reducing caregivers' burden (primary outcome) among caregivers who are in a romantic relationship with the care receivers; (2) the effectiveness of dyadic digital psychological interventions on secondary outcomes such as anxiety, depression, stress, quality of life, well-being and self-efficacy among caregivers and care receivers; and (3) moderating effects of clinical and methodological factors on caregivers' burden.

Appreciating the Good Things in Life During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial and Evaluation of a Gratitude App,Not Multi User,"Kloos, N; Austin, J; van 't Klooster, JW; Drossaert, C; Bohlmeijer, E",JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES,2022,"The Covid-19 pandemic has had many negative consequences on the general public mental health. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of and satisfaction with an app with gratitude exercises to improve the mental health of people with reduced mental well-being due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as potential mechanisms of well-being change and dose-response relationships. A two-armed randomized controlled trial design was used, with two groups receiving the 6-week gratitude intervention app either immediately (intervention group, n = 424) or after 6 weeks (waiting list control group, n = 425). Assessments took place online at baseline (T0), six weeks later (T1) and at 12 weeks (T2), measuring outcomes (i.e., mental well-being, anxiety, depression, stress), and potential explanatory variables (i.e., gratitude, positive reframing, rumination). Linear mixed models analyses showed that when controlled for baseline measures, the intervention group scored better on all outcome measures compared to the control group at T1 (d = .24-.49). These effects were maintained at T2. The control group scored equally well on all outcome measures at T2 after following the intervention. Effects of the intervention on well-being were partially explained by gratitude, positive reframing, and rumination, and finishing a greater number of modules was weakly related to better outcomes.

Assessing Affective Differences between a Virtual General Chemistry Experiment and a Similar Hands-On Experiment,Not mental health,"Hensen, C; Barbera, J",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION,2019,"To date, few general chemistry laboratory studies have included affective measures despite calls for more research on aspects of this domain. This shortage of studies may be partially due to the scarcity of affective measures that have been designed for, or tested in, the college laboratory setting. To provide measures for use in this environment, several existing affective scales were adapted for this new context. Before data from the scales were utilized to study the environment, evidence was provided for the validity and reliability of the data generated from them. Once sufficient evidence was provided, it was possible to determine affective differences between students completing a Beer's law experiment in the traditional hands-on laboratory (control group) and a similar experiment in a virtual environment (treatment group). To assess expected differences between environments, scales for anxiety, emotional satisfaction, intellectual accessibility, usefulness of lab, equipment usability, and open-endedness of lab were selected. To account for potential between-student differences, scales for feeling-related initial interest and value-related initial interest were selected. Overall, students who completed the virtual experiment scored significantly lower on the emotional satisfaction, intellectual accessibility, usefulness of lab, and equipment usability scales. However, it was noted that student responses in the virtual environment varied significantly by which teaching assistant (TA) instructed the section. To test for a possible instructor effect, data from the virtual sections were grouped by TA as Virtual Group A and Virtual Group B. Group A contained the TAs who had sections with lower averages on the emotional satisfaction scale as compared to group B. After controlling for instructor, differences between student responses in the Hands-On sections and Virtual Group A sections were no longer significant while significant differences remained between the responses in the Hands-On and Virtual Group B sections. This outcome indicated that the TA instructing the course may have been more influential on students' affective outcomes than the environment in which the experiment was performed.",10.1021/acs.jchemed.9b00561,wos,Chemistry; Education & Educational Research,General Public; Chemical Education Research; Computer-Based Learning; Distance Learning/Self Instruction,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.9b00561)
Assessing Patient Adherence to and Engagement With Digital Interventions for Depression in Clinical Trials: Systematic Literature Review,Other,"Forbes, A; Keleher, MR; Venditto, M; Dibiasi, F",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,"Background: New approaches to the treatment of depression are necessary for patients who do not respond to current treatments or lack access to them because of barriers such as cost, stigma, and provider shortage. Digital interventions for depression are promising; however, low patient engagement could limit their effectiveness. Objective: This systematic literature review (SLR) assessed how participant adherence to and engagement with digital interventions for depression have been measured in the published literature, what levels of adherence and engagement have been reported, and whether higher adherence and increased engagement are linked to increased efficacy. Methods: We focused on a participant population of adults (aged >= 18 years) with depression or major depressive disorder as the primary diagnosis and included clinical trials, feasibility studies, and pilot studies of digital interventions for treating depression, such as digital therapeutics. We screened 756 unique records from Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane published between January 1, 2000, and April 15, 2022; extracted data from and appraised the 94 studies meeting the inclusion criteria; and performed a primarily descriptive analysis. Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc (Princeton, New Jersey, United States) funded this study. Results: This SLR encompassed results from 20,111 participants in studies using 47 unique web-based interventions (an additional 10 web-based interventions were not described by name), 15 mobile app interventions, 5 app-based interventions that are also accessible via the web, and 1 CD-ROM. Adherence was most often measured as the percentage of participants who completed all available modules. Less than half (44.2%) of the participants completed all the modules; however, the average dose received was 60.7% of the available modules. Although engagement with digital interventions was measured differently in different studies, it was most commonly measured as the number of modules completed, the mean of which was 6.4 (means ranged from 1.0 to 19.7) modules. The mean amount of time participants engaged with the interventions was 3.9 (means ranged from 0.7 to 8.4) hours. Most studies of web-based (34/45, 76%) and app-based (8/9, 89%) interventions found that the intervention group had substantially greater improvement for at least 1 outcome than the control group (eg, care as usual, waitlist, or active control). Of the 14 studies that investigated the relationship between engagement and efficacy, 9 (64%) found that increased engagement with digital interventions was significantly associated with improved participant outcomes. The limitations of this SLR include publication bias, which may overstate engagement and efficacy, and low participant diversity, which reduces the generalizability. Conclusions: Patient adherence to and engagement with digital interventions for depression have been reported in the literature using various metrics. Arriving at more standardized ways of reporting adherence and engagement would enable more effective comparisons across different digital interventions, studies, and populations.",10.2196/43727,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,digital therapeutics; digital interventions; digital health; mobile health; mobile phone; depression; major depressive disorder; engagement; adherence; systematic literature review,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/43727)
Assessing the Efficacy of an Individualized Psychological Flexibility Skills Training Intervention App for Medical Student Burnout and Well-being: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Ditton, E; Knott, B; Hodyl, N; Horton, G; Walker, FR; Nilsson, M",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2022,"Background: Medical student burnout is a prevalent problem with adverse long-term outcomes. Incorporating psychological resource-building interventions into comprehensive burnout prevention approaches during medical training is an identified priority among educators. These interventions could reduce burnout risk by buffering students against nonmodifiable career stressors. However, there is a need for rigorous investigation into optimal intervention targets and methods. Psychological flexibility (PF) is an adaptive behavioral skill set that has demonstrated relationships with medical student burnout and well-being. More broadly, there is evidence that PF mediates burnout and well-being outcomes and may be a protective factor. Efficacy studies assessing the benefits of interventions targeting PF among medical students are needed. Research also supports the need to establish optimal methods for increasing intervention efficacy in the context of individual differences in burnout and PF by using individualized approaches. Objective: This study aims to assess whether an app-delivered PF intervention (Acceptance and Commitment Training) reduces burnout and improves well-being among medical students. We will examine whether changes in burnout and well-being are mediated by changes in PF. The potential benefits of an individualized version of the app versus those of a nonindividualized version will also be evaluated. Methods: In this 3-arm, parallel, randomized controlled study, a sample of medical students will be randomly allocated to 1 of 3 intervention arms (individualized, nonindividualized, and waiting list) by using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Participants in the individualized and nonindividualized intervention arms will have 5 weeks to access the app, which includes a PF concepts training session (stage 1) and access to short PF skill activities on demand (stage 2). Stage 2 will be either individualized to meet participants' identified PF training needs at each log-in or nonindividualized. Results: Burnout, well-being, and PF will be assessed at baseline and after the intervention. Quantitative analyses will include descriptive and inferential statistics. We hypothesize that the Acceptance and Commitment Training intervention app will be effective in improving burnout and well-being and that changes in these outcomes will be mediated by changes in PF. We further hypothesize that participants in the individualized intervention group will demonstrate greater improvements in burnout and well-being outcomes than those in the nonindividualized group. Conclusions: The findings of this study could guide the development of burnout prevention and well-being initiatives for medical students. Identifying PF as a mediating process would provide support for the delivery of preventive intervention programs that train individuals to strengthen this psychological resource before burnout symptoms emerge. This would be an important step in addressing and potentially offsetting the significant costs of burnout among medical students and physicians. Demonstrating the superiority of an individualized version of the app over a nonindividualized version would have implications for enhancing intervention precision and efficacy by using scalable interventions.",10.2196/32992,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",burnout; psychological; burnout interventions; psychological flexibility; digital intervention; individualized intervention; acceptance and commitment therapy; medical students; well-being; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/32992)
Assessing the Impact of Conversational Artificial Intelligence in the Treatment of Stress and Anxiety in Aging Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Danieli, M; Ciulli, T; Mousavi, SM; Silvestri, G; Barbato, S; Di Natale, L; Riccardi, G",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2022,"Background: While mental health applications are increasingly becoming available for large populations of users, there is a lack of controlled trials on the impacts of such applications. Artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered agents have been evaluated when assisting adults with cognitive impairments; however, few applications are available for aging adults who are still actively working. These adults often have high stress levels related to changes in their work places, and related symptoms eventually affect their quality of life.Objective: We aimed to evaluate the contribution of TEO (Therapy Empowerment Opportunity), a mobile personal health care agent with conversational AI. TEO promotes mental health and well-being by engaging patients in conversations to recollect the details of events that increased their anxiety and by providing therapeutic exercises and suggestions.Methods: The study was based on a protocolized intervention for stress and anxiety management. Participants with stress symptoms and mild-to-moderate anxiety received an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered remotely. A group of participants also interacted with the agent TEO. The participants were active workers aged over 55 years. The experimental groups were as follows: group 1, traditional therapy; group 2, traditional therapy and mobile health (mHealth) agent; group 3, mHealth agent; and group 4, no treatment (assigned to a waiting list). Symptoms related to stress (anxiety, physical disease, and depression) were assessed prior to treatment (T1), at the end (T2), and 3 months after treatment (T3), using standardized psychological questionnaires. Moreover, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and General Anxiety Disorders-7 scales were administered before the intervention (T1), at mid-term (T2), at the end of the intervention (T3), and after 3 months (T4). At the end of the intervention, participants in groups 1, 2, and 3 filled in a satisfaction questionnaire.Results: Despite randomization, statistically significant differences between groups were present at T1. Group 4 showed lower levels of anxiety and depression compared with group 1, and lower levels of stress compared with group 2. Comparisons between groups at T2 and T3 did not show significant differences in outcomes. Analyses conducted within groups showed significant differences between times in group 2, with greater improvements in the levels of stress and scores related to overall well-being. A general worsening trend between T2 and T3 was detected in all groups, with a significant increase in stress levels in group 2. Group 2 reported higher levels of perceived usefulness and satisfaction.Conclusions: No statistically significant differences could be observed between participants who used the mHealth app alone or within the traditional CBT setting. However, the results indicated significant differences within the groups that received treatment and a stable tendency toward improvement, which was limited to individual perceptions of stress-related symptoms.",10.2196/38067,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,mental health care; conversational artificial intelligence; mobile health; mHealth; personal health care agent,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/38067)

The 6 practices were randomized into either early (3-month control period; 12-month intervention) or late (6-month control period; 9-month intervention) groups. The primary outcome measure of interest was the Assessment of Quality of Life-4D (AQoL-4D). Data were collected at baseline and at 3 monthly intervals for the duration of the trial. Ethnographic data included observations and interviews with patients and providers at the midpoint and end of the intervention. Outcome data were analyzed using linear models conducted at the individual level, accounting for cluster effects at the practice level, and ethnographic data were analyzed using qualitative description and framework analysis methods. Results: Recruitment challenges resulted in fewer sites and participants than expected; of the 176 target, only 142 (80.6%) patients were identified as eligible to participate because of lower-than-expected provider participation and fewer-than-expected patients willing to participate or perceived as ready to engage in goal-setting. Of the 142 patients approached, 45 (32%) participated. Patients set a variety of goals related to self-management, mental health, social health, and overall well-being. Owing to underpowering, the impact of ePRO on quality of life could not be definitively assessed; however, the intervention group, ePRO plus usual care (mean 15.28, SD 18.60) demonstrated a nonsignificant decrease in quality of life (t(24) =-1.20; P=.24) when compared with usual care only (mean 21.76, SD 2.17). The ethnographic data reveal a complex implementation process in which the meaningfulness (or coherence) of the technology to individuals' lives and work acted as a key driver of adoption and tool appraisal. Conclusions: This trial experienced many unexpected and significant implementation challenges related to recruitment and engagement. Future studies could be improved through better alignment of the research methods and intervention to the complex and diverse clinical settings, dynamic goal-oriented care process, and readiness of provider and patient participants.",10.2196/29071,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,older adults; goal-oriented care; quality of life; self-management; primary care; eHealth; pragmatic trial; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/29071)

Association between social media use and students' academic performance through family bonding and collective learning: The moderating role of mental well-being,Other,"Zhang, XY; Abbas, J; Shahzad, MF; Shankar, A; Ercisli, S; Dobhal, DC",EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,2024,"The advent of the digital age represents a transformative era in which technology, primarily social media platforms, has become an integral part of the daily lives of individuals worldwide. Students are the most prolific users of social media, utilizing these platforms for a variety of purposes, including communication, information sharing, entertainment, and social networking. This study evaluated the connection between student social media use and academic performance through family bonding and collaborative learning. This research also explores how mental wellbeing moderates the link between students' family bonding, collaborative learning, and academic performance. This research article analyzes a sample of 330 university students from the public and private sectors and tests the proposed hypothesized relationships. The study used the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) methodological approach for evaluating proposed parameters. The findings indicated that social media use positively correlated with students' academic performance. Second, family bonding and collaborative learning significantly moderated the association between students' academic performance and social media use. Finally, mental well-being significantly moderated the connection between students' collaborative learning, family bonding, and academic performance.

Attrition in Conversational Agent-Delivered Mental Health Interventions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Good,"Jabir, AI; Lin, XW; Martinengo, L; Sharp, G; Theng, YL; Car, LT",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2024,"Background: Conversational agents (CAs) or chatbots are computer programs that mimic human conversation. They have the potential to improve access to mental health interventions through automated, scalable, and personalized delivery of psychotherapeutic content. However, digital health interventions, including those delivered by CAs, often have high attrition rates. Identifying the factors associated with attrition is critical to improving future clinical trials. Objective: This review aims to estimate the overall and differential rates of attrition in CA-delivered mental health interventions (CA interventions), evaluate the impact of study design and intervention-related aspects on attrition, and describe study design features aimed at reducing or mitigating study attrition. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science, and conducted a gray literature search on Google Scholar in June 2022. We included randomized controlled trials that compared CA interventions against control groups and excluded studies that lasted for 1 session only and used Wizard of Oz interventions. We also assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. Random-effects proportional meta-analysis was applied to calculate the pooled dropout rates in the intervention groups. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to compare the attrition rate in the intervention groups with that in the control groups. We used a narrative review to summarize the findings. Results: The systematic search retrieved 4566 records from peer-reviewed databases and citation searches, of which 41 (0.90%) randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analytic overall attrition rate in the intervention group was 21.84% (95% CI 16.74%-27.36%; I-2=94%). Short-term studies that lasted <= 8 weeks showed a lower attrition rate (18.05%, 95% CI 9.91%- 27.76%; I-2=94.6%) than long-term studies that lasted >8 weeks (26.59%, 95% CI 20.09%-33.63%; I-2=93.89%). Intervention group participants were more likely to attrit than control group participants for short-term (log odds ratio 1.22, 95% CI 0.99-1.50; I-2=21.89%) and long-term studies (log odds ratio 1.33, 95% CI 1.08-1.65; I-2=49.43%). Intervention-related characteristics associated with higher attrition include stand-alone CA interventions without human support, not having a symptom tracker feature, no visual representation of the CA, and comparing CA interventions with waitlist controls. No participant-level factor reliably predicted attrition. Conclusions: Our results indicated that approximately one-fifth of the participants will drop out from CA interventions in short-term studies. High heterogeneities made it difficult to generalize the findings. Our results suggested that future CA interventions should adopt a blended design with human support, use symptom tracking, compare CA intervention groups against active controls rather than waitlist controls, and include a visual representation of the CA to reduce the attrition rate.",10.2196/48168,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,conversational agent; chatbot; mental health; mHealth; attrition; dropout; mobile phone; artificial intelligence; AI; systematic review; meta-analysis; digital health interventions,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/48168)
AudienceMR: Extending the Local Space for Large-Scale Audience with Mixed Reality for Enhanced Remote Lecturer Experience,Other,"Han, B; Kim, GJ",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,2021,"AudienceMR is designed as a multi-user mixed reality space that seamlessly extends the local user space to become a large, shared classroom where some of the audience members are seen seated in a real space, and more members are seen through an extended portal. AudienceMR can provide a sense of the presence of a large-scale crowd/audience with the associated spatial context. In contrast to virtual reality (VR), however, with mixed reality (MR), a lecturer can deliver content or conduct a performance from a real, actual, comfortable, and familiar local space, while interacting directly with real nearby objects, such as a desk, podium, educational props, instruments, and office materials. Such a design will elicit a realistic user experience closer to an actual classroom, which is currently prohibitive owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper validated our hypothesis by conducting a comparative experiment assessing the lecturer's experience with two independent variables: (1) an online classroom platform type, i.e., a 2D desktop video teleconference, a 2D video screen grid in VR, 3D VR, and AudienceMR, and (2) a student depiction, i.e., a 2D upper-body video screen and a 3D full-body avatar. Our experiment validated that AudienceMR exhibits a level of anxiety and fear of public speaking closer to that of a real classroom situation, and a higher social and spatial presence than 2D video grid-based solutions and even 3D VR. Compared to 3D VR, AudienceMR offers a more natural and easily usable real object-based interaction. Most subjects preferred AudienceMR over the alternatives despite the nuisance of having to wear a video see-through headset. Such qualities will result in information conveyance and an educational efficacy comparable to those of a real classroom, and better than those achieved through popular 2D desktop teleconferencing or immersive 3D VR solutions.",10.3390/app11199022,wos,Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Science; Physics,mixed reality; augmented reality; human-computer interaction; public speaking; social presence,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3390/app11199022)
Augmenting group hoarding disorder treatment with virtual reality discarding: A pilot study in older adults,Good,"Raila, H; Avanesyan, T; Valentine, KE; Koo, B; Huang, C; Tsutsumi, Y; Andreeff, E; Qiu, TR; Rodríguez, PAM; Varias, A; Filippou-Frye, M; van Roessel, P; Bullock, K; Periyakoil, VS; Rodríguez, CI",JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH,2023,"Hoarding disorder is common and debilitating, especially in older adults, and novel treatment approaches are needed. Many current treatments emphasize skills related to discarding and decision-making about possessions, which can be practiced in the patient's home. However in many cases, in-home visits are unfeasible, or real-life discarding is too difficult. Virtual reality (VR) offers the ability to create a virtual home including 3D scans of the patient's actual possessions that can be moved or discarded. VR discarding is an alternative to in-home visits and an approach that provides a stepping stone to real-life discarding. VR has been successfully utilized to treat many disorders but tested minimally in hoarding disorder. In nine older adults with hoarding disorder, we tested an 8-week VR intervention administered to augment a 16-week Buried in Treasures group treatment. Individualized VR rooms were uniquely modeled after each patient's home. During clinician-administered VR sessions, patients practiced sorting and discarding their virtual possessions. The intervention was feasible to administer. Open-ended participant responses, examined by two independent evaluators, indicated that VR sessions were well-tolerated and that participants found them useful, with nearly all participants noting that VR helped them increase real-life discarding. Self-reported hoarding symptoms decreased from baseline to close, with seven of the nine participants showing reliable improvement in this timeframe and none showing deterioration. Results from this exploratory pilot study suggest that VR is a feasible way to simulate an at-home sorting and discarding experience in a manner that may augment skills acquisition. It remains an open question whether VR discarding practice yields greater improvement than existing treatments. VR for this population merits further clinical investigation.",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.08.002,wos,Psychiatry,Hoarding; Clutter; Virtual reality; Geropsychology,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.08.002)
Authenticity and interest in virtual reality: Findings from an experiment including educational virtual environments created with 3D modeling and photogrammetry,Not Multi User,"Fink, MC; Sosa, D; Eisenlauer, V; Ertl, B",FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION,2023,"Virtual Reality (VR) and photogrammetry are emerging technologies that facilitate and shape the ongoing digital transformation of education. VR offers new opportunities for creating immersive and interactive educational experiences. Photogrammetry enables new ways to create lifelike educational virtual environments and is becoming an alternative to manual 3D modeling with graphics software. The manner in which VR affects the authenticity of educational experiences has been addressed in previous educational and psychological research. Empirical papers have so far focused on the authenticity of educational VR environments created by 3D modeling. However, little is known about the authenticity of educational VR environments developed with photogrammetry. Given that VR provides rich multi-sensory experiences and interests can be stimulated by engaging contexts, educational VR environments also possess great potential to support interest development. What is still unknown regarding this topic are the beneficial characteristics of VR environments and the individual variables required to trigger and explain interest development. Consequently, we conducted an experiment following up on the mentioned authenticity and interest research questions in the context of higher education. A two-group between-subjects design was used and N = 64 educational science and psychology university students gathered information about a railroad bridge wearing a head-mounted display (HMD). The control group encountered an educational virtual environment created with 3D modeling. The intervention group was presented with the same educational virtual environment but the main object of the railroad bridge was generated by photogrammetry. Situational interest was measured in the pretest and the posttest; authenticity-related variables (i.e., presence and representation fidelity) were assessed in the posttest. Concerning authenticity, there were no significant group differences. Photogrammetry might thus not affect authenticity in educational contexts in which participants focus on gathering information. Regarding interest development, there were two main findings. First, interest in VR for learning increased from pretest to posttest, supporting that interest can be induced in VR. Second, a large share of posttest interest was explained by presence and pretest interest, highlighting the importance of these variables.",10.3389/feduc.2023.969966,wos,Education & Educational Research,authenticity; interest; virtual reality; photogrammetry; 3D modeling; presence; educational virtual environment; laser scanning,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2023.969966)
Automated Digital Interventions and Smoking Cessation: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Relating Efficiency to a Psychological Theory of Intervention Perspective,Not mental health,"Sha, LH; Yang, X; Deng, RH; Wang, W; Tao, YJ; Cao, HL; Ma, QS; Wang, H; Nie, YR; Leng, SQ; Lv, QY; Li, XJ; Wang, HY; Meng, YJ; Xu, JJ; Greenshaw, AJ; Li, T; Guo, WJ",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Smoking remains a highly significant preventable global public health problem. In this context, digital interventions offer great advantages in terms of a lack of biological side effects, possibility of automatic delivery, and consequent human resource savings relative to traditional interventions. Such interventions have been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but have not been systematically reviewed with the inclusion of text-based and multiplatform-based interventions. In addition, this area has not been evaluated from the perspective of the psychological theoretical basis of intervention. Objective: The aim of this paper is to assess the efficiency of digital interventions in RCT studies of smoking cessation and to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies used for digital interventions. Methods: An electronic search of RCTs was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library by June 30, 2021. Eligible studies had to compare automated digital intervention (ADI) to the use of a self-help guideline or no intervention. Participants were current smokers (aged 16 years or older). As the main outcome, abstinence after endpoint was extracted from the studies. Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the efficiency of ADIs. Metaregressions were conducted to assess the relationship between intervention theory and effectiveness. Results: A total of 19 trials (15,472 participants) were included in the analysis. The overall abstinence rate (95% CI) at the endpoint was 17.8% (17.0-18.7). The overall risk ratio of the intervention group compared to the controls at the endpoint was 17.8% (17.0-18.7). Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (ROB 2) suggested that most of the studies had a low risk of bias (56.3%). Psychological theory-related constructs or predictors, which refer to other theory-based concepts (rather than only behavioral theory) such as craving or anxiety, are associated with effectiveness. Conclusions: This study found that ADI had a clear positive effect compared to self-help guidelines or to no intervention, and effectiveness was associated with theory-related constructs or predictors. ADIs should be promoted by policy makers and clinical practitioners to address the huge gap between the need for smoking cessation and availability of traditional treatment resources. Possible increases in ADI efficiency may be achieved by optimally integrating psychotherapeutic theories and techniques.",10.2196/38206,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,smoking cessation; automated; digital intervention; psychological theory; meta-analysis; systematic review; public health; side effects; interventions; randomized controlled trial; self-help,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/38206)

We tested the efficacy of an automated cognitive intervention for fear of heights guided by an avatar virtual coach (animated using motion and voice capture of an actor) in VR and delivered with the latest consumer equipment. Methods We did a randomised trial of automated VR versus usual care. We recruited adults aged older than 18 years with a fear of heights by radio advertisements in Oxfordshire, UK. We diagnosed fear of heights if participants scored more than 29 on the Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ). We randomly allocated participants by computer in a 1:1 ratio to either automated VR delivered in roughly six 30-min sessions administered about two to three times a week over a 2-week period (intervention group) or to usual care (control group). Randomisation was stratified by severity of fear of heights. The research team, who were unaware of the random allocation, administered three fearof-height assessments, at baseline (0 weeks), at the end of treatment (2 weeks), and at follow-up (4 weeks). The primary outcome measure was HIQ score (range 16-80, with higher scores indicating greater severity). This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN11898283. Findings Between Nov 25, 2017, and Feb 27, 2018, 100 individuals were enrolled and underwent randomisation, of whom 49 were assigned to the VR treatment group and 51 to the control group. All participants completed the 4-week follow-up. The mean total treatment time in VR was 124.43 min (SD 34.23).

We developed a new brief automated virtual reality (VR) cognitive treatment that has the potential to be used easily in clinical services. We aimed to compare VR cognitive therapy with an alternative VR therapy (mental relaxation), with an emphasis on understanding potential mechanisms of action. Methods THRIVE was a parallel-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial across four UK National Health Service trusts in England. Participants were included if they were aged 16 years or older, had a persistent (at least 3 months) persecutory delusion held with at least 50% conviction, reported feeling threatened when outside with other people, and had a primary diagnosis from the referring clinical team of a non-affective psychotic disorder. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to either THRIVE VR cognitive therapy or VR mental relaxation, using a permuted blocks algorithm with randomly varying block size, stratified by severity of delusion. Usual care continued for all participants. Each VR therapy was provided in four sessions over approximately 4 weeks, supported by an assistant psychologist or clinical psychologist. Trial assessors were masked to group allocation. Outcomes were assessed at 0, 2 (therapy mid-point), 4 (primary endpoint, end of treatment), 8, 16, and 24 weeks. The primary outcome was persecutory delusion conviction, assessed by the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale (PSYRATS; rated 0-100%). Outcome analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed the treatment credibility and expectancy of the interventions and the two mechanisms (defence behaviours and safety beliefs) that the cognitive intervention was designed to target. This trial is prospectively registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN12497310. Findings From Sept 21, 2018, to May 13, 2021 (with a pause due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions from March 16, 2020, to Sept 14, 2020), we recruited 80 participants with persistent persecutory delusions (49 [61%] men, 31 [39%] women, with a mean age of 40 years [SD 13, range 18-73], 64 [80%] White, six [8%] Black, one [1%] Indian, three [4%] Pakistani, and six [8%] other race or ethnicity). We randomly assigned 39 (49%) participants assigned to VR cognitive therapy and 41 (51%) participants to VR mental relaxation. 33 (85%) participants who were assigned to VR cognitive therapy attended all four sessions, and 35 (85%) participants assigned to VR mental relaxation attended all four sessions. We found no significant differences between the two VR interventions in participant ratings of treatment credibility (adjusted mean difference -1 center dot 55 [95% CI -3 center dot 68 to 0 center dot 58]; p=0 center dot 15) and outcome expectancy (-0 center dot 91 [-3 center dot 42 to 1 center dot 61]; p=0 center dot 47). 77 (96%) participants provided follow-up data at the primary timepoint. Compared with VR mental relaxation, VR cognitive therapy did not lead to a greater improvement in persecutory delusions (adjusted mean difference -2 center dot 16 [-12 center dot 77 to 8 center dot 44]; p=0 center dot 69). Compared with VR mental relaxation, VR cognitive therapy did not lead to a greater reduction in use of defence behaviours (adjusted mean difference -0 center dot 71 [-4 center dot 21 to 2 center dot 79]; p=0 center dot 69) or a greater increase in belief in safety (-5 center dot 89 [-16 center dot 83 to 5 center dot 05]; p=0 center dot 29). There were 17 serious adverse events unrelated to the trial (ten events in seven participants in the VR cognitive therapy group and seven events in five participants in the VR mental relaxation group). Interpretation The two VR interventions performed similarly, despite the fact that they had been designed to affect different mechanisms. Both interventions had high uptake rates and were associated with large improvements in persecutory delusions but it cannot be determined that the treatments accounted for the change. Immersive technologies hold promise for the treatment of severe mental health problems. However, their use will likely benefit from experimental research on the application of different therapeutic techniques and the effects on a range of potential mechanisms of action.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an automated VR cognitive therapy (gameChange) to treat avoidance and distress in patients with psychosis, and to analyse how and in whom it might work. Methods We did a parallel-group, single-blind, randomised, controlled trial across nine National Health Service trusts in England. Eligible patients were aged 16 years or older, with a clinical diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder or an affective diagnosis with psychotic symptoms, and had self-reported difficulties going outside due to anxiety. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either gameChange VR therapy plus usual care or usual care alone, using a permuted blocks algorithm with randomly varying block size, stratified by study site and service type. gameChange VR therapy was provided in approximately six sessions over 6 weeks. Trial assessors were masked to group allocation. Outcomes were assessed at 0, 6 (primary endpoint), and 26 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome was avoidance of, and distress in, everyday situations, assessed using the self-reported Oxford Agoraphobic Avoidance Scale (O-AS). Outcome analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all participants who were assigned to a study group for whom data were available). We performed planned mediation and moderation analyses to test the effects of gameChange VR therapy when added to usual care. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 17308399. Findings Between July 25, 2019, and May 7, 2021 (with a pause in recruitment from March 16, 2020, to Sept 14, 2020, due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions), 551 patients were assessed for eligibility and 346 were enrolled. 231 (67%) patients were men and 111 (32%) were women, 294 (85%) were White, and the mean age was 37.2 years (SD 12.5). 174 patients were randomly assigned to the gameChange VR therapy group and 172 to the usual care alone group. Compared with the usual care alone group, the gameChange VR therapy group had significant reductions in agoraphobic avoidance (0-AS adjusted mean difference -0.47, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.06; n=320; Cohen's d -0.18; p=0.026) and distress (-4.33, -7.78 to -0.87; n=322; -0.26; p=0 . 014) at 6 weeks. Reductions in threat cognitions and within-situation defence behaviours mediated treatment outcomes. The greater the severity of anxious fears and avoidance, the greater the treatment benefits. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events between the gameChange VR therapy group (12 events in nine patients) and the usual care alone group (eight events in seven patients; p=0.37). Interpretation Automated VR therapy led to significant reductions in anxious avoidance of, and distress in, everyday situations compared with usual care alone. The mediation analysis indicated that the VR therapy worked in accordance with the cognitive model by reducing anxious thoughts and associated protective behaviours. The moderation analysis indicated that the VR therapy particularly benefited patients with severe agoraphobic avoidance, such as not being able to leave the home unaccompanied. gameChange VR therapy has the potential to increase the provision of effective psychological therapy for psychosis, particularly for patients who find it difficult to leave their home, visit local ainenities, or use public transport.

Automatic drug use behavior: Characteristics of cue-induced reactivity and behavior extinction,Not Multi User,"Zeng, H; Zheng, ZL; Luo, XH; Wang, PF; Wang, MC; Su, DQ; Yang, WD; Huang, HJ; Peng, SN",ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA,2022,"Under relevant cues, people who are addicted tend to use drugs with little attention, purpose or cognitive effort, conforming to an automated habitual response behavior. When the substance is not available, this habitual response behavior will be transformed into psychological craving. A common goal of addiction treatment is to reduce cue-induced reactivity that has automatic and unconscious features. Based on previous research, this study used a self-report questionnaire, two behavioral experiments, and measures of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to explore the characteristics and neural mechanisms of cue-induced reactivity in heroin addicts under drug- related cues. On this basis, a training program using Virtual Reality (VR) technology and an Approach-Avoidance task (AAT) was designed to weaken the association between drug-related cues and automatic drug use behavior. In Study 1, the participants (N = 38) were men who were addicted to heroin (n =19) and a matched sample of healthy controls (n = 19). The Visual Analog Craving Scale (VAS) was used to investigate cue-induced reactivity by self-report. We then assessed ERPs to explore the nature and neural mechanism of cue-induced reactivity. We hypothesized that compared to the healthy controls, the participants who were addicted to heroin would show more cue-induced reactivity in the form of automatic response outside of awareness. Corroborating our hypotheses in Study 1, we proceeded to Study 2. N = 60 men who were addicted to heroin were equally divided into a treatment group (n = 30) and a no- treatment group (n = 30). The treatment was VR-AAT training for 10 sessions over the course of two months, with the goal of reducing or eliminating cue-induced reactivity. Before and after the treatment, VR-AAT and the Craving Automatized Scale-Substances (CAS-S) questionnaire were used to test the difference between the two groups. The results showed that 1) In between-group comparisons, VAS scores were higher in the addicts than in the control group. And in Study 2, the within-group analyses showed that self-reports of drug use behavior being unconscious and involuntary were significantly correlated with the duration of addiction. 2) In within-group analyses, N1 amplitude was smaller, latency was shorter, and reaction time was longer in response to drug-related cues versus neutral cues. Other between-group analyses of the ERP data, addicts demonstrated smaller N1 amplitude and longer reaction time in response to drug-related cues compared to the healthy controls, and these differences were concentrated in the central regions of the brain (i.e., the parietal lobe). 3) After the VR-AAT training, the physiological index (based on temperature, diastolic pressure and systolic pressure) decreased significantly, and the coefficient of approach bias of AAT [(Avoid behavior RTs (drug-related) - Approach behavior RTs (drug-related)) - (Avoid behavior RTs (neutral) - Approach behavior RTs (neutral))] was significantly smaller than before training. The results were the same at a two-month follow-up. Our findings revealed that cue-induced reactivity showed characteristics of being automatic and unconscious, with greater N1 reactivity in sensorimotor and related brain areas. The VR-AAT training was effective in reducing cue- induced reactions among men addicted to heroin, suggesting that this method has potential applied value in treating heroin addiction and in designing relapse prevention programs. This research contributes to the addiction literature in two ways. First, AAT training has been used in the treatment of alcohol addiction, but not for other forms of addiction. This is the first research to use AAT training to treat heroin addiction. Second, the treatment in the current study is the first one to combine AAT with virtual reality technology. The VR-AAT method might also be a feasible approach for other substance abuse treatments, although more experimental evidence would be needed to support this. One limitation of this study was that the basis of automatic drug use behavior and automatic refusing drug use behavior cannot be distinguished. This issue can be investigated in future research.",10.3724/SP.J.1041.2022.01193,wos,Psychology,drug addiction; cue induced reactivity; automatic drug use behavior; bias approach; extinguish; ERP; VR,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1041.2022.01193)

Filtering of biologically active short wavelength (blue) light by orange tinted eyewear has been shown to induce antimanic and sleep promoting effects in inpatient mania. We here describe a study protocol assessing acute and long-term stabilizing effects of blue blocking (BB) glasses in outpatient treatment of bipolar disorder.Patients and methods: A total of 150 outpatients with bipolar disorder and current symptoms of (hypo)-mania will be randomized 1:1 to wear glasses with either high (99%) (intervention group) or low (15%) (control group) filtration of short wavelength light (<500 nm). Following a baseline assessment including ratings of manic and depressive symptoms, sleep questionnaires, pupillometric evaluation and 48-h actigraphy, participants will wear the glasses from 6 PM to 8 AM for 7 consecutive days. The primary outcome is the between group difference in change in Young Mania Rating Scale scores after 7 days of intervention (day 9). Following the initial treatment period, the long-term stabilizing effects on mood and sleep will be explored in a 3-month treatment paradigm, where the period of BB treatment is tailored to the current symptomatology using a 14-h antimanic schedule during (hypo-) manic episodes (BB glasses or dark bedroom from 6 PM to 8 AM) and a 2-h maintenance schedule (BB glasses on two hours prior to bedtime/dark bedroom) during euthymic and depressive states.The assessments will be repeated at follow-up visits after 1 and 3 months. Throughout the 3-month study period, participants will perform continuous daily self-monitoring of mood, sleep and activity in a smartphone-based app. Secondary outcomes include between-group differences in actigraphic sleep parameters on day 9 and in day-to-day instability in mood, sleep and activity, general functioning and objective sleep markers (actigraphy) at weeks 5 and 15.",10.1080/07853890.2023.2292250,"pubmed, wos",General & Internal Medicine,Bipolar disorder; mania; chronotherapeutics; dark therapy; blue blocking; BB-glasses; maintenance; RCT,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2023.2292250)
BRIGHTEN Heart: Design and baseline characteristics of a randomized controlled trial for minority older adults with depression and cardiometabolic syndrome,Population,"Rothschild, SK; Emery-Tiburcio, EE; Mack, LJ; Wang, Y; Avery, EF; Li, H; Golden, RL; Powell, LH",CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS,2016,"Objectives: African American and Hispanic elderly are at elevated risk of both depression and cardiovascular disease, relative to non-Hispanic whites. Effective interventions are therefore needed to address depressive symptoms and to reduce these disparities. BRIGHTEN Heart was a behavioral randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a virtual team intervention in reducing depressive symptoms in minority elderly as measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9). Study design: 250 African American and Hispanic adults, age >= 60 years, with comorbid depression and overweight/obesity were randomized. Participants randomized to the Intervention condition received a social work evaluation, team-based electronic consultation, case management, and psychotherapy over a 12 month period. Control participants were enrolled in a membership program that provided health classes and other services to support chronic disease self-management. Blinded research assistants completed assessments at baseline, and 6 and 12 months postrandomization. Results: The study population was characterized by low socioeconomic status, with 81.4% having a household income of less than $20,000. Although median depression scores were in the mild range, 25% of participants had scores showing moderate to severe depression at baseline. 75% of participants had four or more chronic conditions. Significant demographic and clinical differences were observed between the African American and Hispanic populations. Conclusions: BRIGHTEN Heart was designed to rigorously test the efficacy of a multi-level intervention to reduce comorbid depressive symptoms and cardiovascular risk in minority elderly. Investigators successfully recruited a cohort well suited to testing the study hypothesis.

Digital health technologies have been proposed as a way to improve access to primary health care services, yet our understanding of the unique barriers and facilitators to accessing this form of care among immigrants and refugees remains limited. A scoping review was conducted to (1) identify the barriers and facilitators to digital PHC access as experienced by immigrants and refugees, and (2) to characterize which primary health care needs are being addressed, and through which digital modalities.Subjects and methodsWe searched CINAHL, Embase, Global Health, Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus and Web of Science databases for qualitative studies, according to the Arksey and O'Malley (Int J Soc Res Methodol 8(1):19-32, 2005) framework.ResultsThe screening process yielded 25 articles included in the review.

The surrounding literature is vast, complex, and difficult to comprehend, necessitating frequent reviews. However, due to the sheer size of the literature, such reviews are generally fragmented focusing only on the factors causing the financial exclusion of women while ignoring the interventions that have been discussed all along. Filling up this gap, this study attempts to provide a bird's-view to systematically connect all the factors as well as mediations found in past studies with the present and future. PRISMA approach has been used to explain various inclusions and exclusions extracted from Scopus & WOS databases with the backward and forward searches of important studies. Collaborative peer review selection with a qualitative synthesis of results is used to explain various barriers and interventions in financial inclusion that affected women's empowerment in the period 2000-2020.

Batching smartphone notifications can improve well-being,Not Multi User,"Fitz, N; Kushlev, K; Jagannathan, R; Lewis, T; Paliwal, D; Ariely, D",COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,2019,"Every day, billions of us receive smartphone notifications. Designed to distract, these interruptions capture and monetize our time and attention. Though smartphones are incredibly helpful, their current notification systems impose underappreciated, yet considerable, mental costs; like a slot machine, they exploit our inherent psychological bias for variable rewards. With an app that we developed, we conducted a randomized field experiment (n = 237) to test whether batching notifications-delivering notifications in predictable intervals throughout the day-could improve psychological well-being. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups to either receive notifications as usual, batched, or never. Using daily diary surveys, we measured a range of psychological and health outcomes, and through our app system, we collected data on phone use behaviors. Compared to those in the control condition, participants whose notifications were batched three-times-a-day felt more attentive, productive, in a better mood, and in greater control of their phones. Participants in the batched group also reported lower stress, lower productivity, and fewer phone interruptions. In contrast, participants who did not receive notifications at all reaped few of those benefits, but experienced higher levels of anxiety and fear of missing out (FoMO). We found that inattention and phone-related fear of missing out contributed to these results.

BITs refers to behavioral and psychological interventions that use information and communication technology features to address behavioral and mental health outcomes. Method: This study on the findings of the technical expert panel. Results: Videoconferencing and standard telephone technologies to deliver psychotherapy have been well validated. Web-based interventions have shown efficacy across a broad range of mental health outcomes. Social media such as online support groups have produced disappointing outcomes when used alone. Mobile technologies have received limited attention for mental health outcomes. Virtual reality has shown good efficacy for anxiety and pediatric disorders. Serious gaming has received little work in mental health. Conclusion: Research focused on understanding reach, adherence, barriers and cost is recommended. Improvements in the collection, storage, analysis and visualization of big data will be required. New theoretical models and evaluation strategies will be required. Finally, for BITs to have a public health impact, research on implementation and application to prevention is required. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Behavioral and Cognitive Intervention Strategies Delivered via Coached Apps for Depression: Pilot Trial,Good,"Stiles-Shields, C; Montague, E; Kwasny, MJ; Mohr, DC",PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES,2019,"Depression is common in primary care settings, but barriers prevent many primary care patients from initiating treatment. Smartphone apps stand as a possible means to overcome such barriers. However, there is limited evidence to understand the use and efficacy of these apps. The purpose of the current study was to pilot an evaluation of the usage and efficacy of apps for depression based upon behavioral or cognitive intervention skills, compared to a wait-list control. Thirty adults with depression were randomized to the use of either a behavioral app (Boost Me) or a cognitive app (Thought Challenger) or to a wait-list control. Boost Me and Thought Challenger participants received 6 weeks of the respective intervention along with weekly coaching sessions, with a 4-week follow-up period; wait-list control participants received no interventions for 10 weeks. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine depression over time and across treatment groups; t tests compared app usage across groups. Depression scores changed significantly over time (p<.001), with group differences occurring between Thought Challenger and wait-list control participants (p=.03). Boost Me was used significantly more than was Thought Challenger (p=.02); however, there was no evidence to suggest correlations between usage and changes in depression (ps>.05). The present study provides initial support that intervention strategies for depression delivered via apps with human support can impact symptoms and may promote continued use over 6 weeks.

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of using a VR headset as a distraction for managing the anxiety and behaviour of paediatric patients during their dental treatment. Eighty patients, aged between five and ten years old and who required dental treatment over three or more appointments, were randomly allocated into two groups. One group used a VR headset during all their appointments, and the other one did not use any distraction technique. The patients were asked to take a Facial Image Scale Test during their first and last appointments to assess their level of anxiety. Additionally, the dentist completed the Frankl Test to quantify the child's behaviour at the beginning and the end of their treatment. The results obtained, both from the group using the VR headset and from the control group, were compared using the chi-square test. The use of a VR headset during dental treatment significantly reduced anxiety (95% of the children were happy) and improved behaviour (100% positive behaviour) as compared with the control group (40% and 57.5%, respectively).

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the anxiety level experienced by women undergoing a visual inspection with acetic acid and Lugol iodine (VIA and VILI) examination, with or without watching the procedure on a digital screen. Methods: This prospective randomized study took place in the district of Dschang, Cameroon. A previous cervical cancer screening campaign tested women aged between 30 and 49 years for human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV-positive women were invited for the 12-month follow-up control visit, including a VIA/VILI examination During that visit, we recruited women to participate in this study. Before the examination, participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a control group (CG) and an intervention group (IG). Women in both groups underwent a pelvic examination and were verbally informed about the steps undertaken during the gynecological examination The IG could also watch it live on a tablet screen. Women's anxiety was assessed before and immediately after the examination, using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). A paired t test was used to compare the mean STAI score for each question before and after VIA/VILI while a nonpaired, 2-sided t test was used to compare the mean differences of the STAI score between the 2 study groups. Results: A total of 122 women were randomized in the study; 4 of them were excluded as they did not undergo the pelvic examination, did not answer to the second STAI questionnaire because of personal reasons, or the cervix could not be properly visualized. Thus, the final sample size consisted of 118 patients of whom 58 women were assigned to the CG and 60 to the IG. The mean age was 39.1 (SD 5.2) years. Before the examination, the mean (SD) STAI score was 33.6 (SD 10.9) in the CG and 36.4 (SD 11.8) in the IG (P=.17). The STAI score after pelvic examination was significantly reduced for both groups (CG: 29.3 [SD 11.2]; IG: 28.5 [SD 12.0]). Overall, the difference of the STAI scores before and after the pelvic examination was lower in the CG (4.2 [SD 9.0]) than in the IG (7.9 [SD 14.3]), although the difference was not significant (P=.10). However, the women's emotional state, such as I feel secure and I feel strained, was improved in the IG as compared with the CG (CG: P=.01; IG: P=.007). Conclusions: Watching the VIA/VILI procedure in real time improved the women's emotional state but did not reduce the periprocedural anxiety measured by the STAI score. Furthermore, larger studies should assess women's satisfaction with watching their pelvic examination in real time to determine whether this tool could be included in VIA/VILI routine practice.",10.2196/cancer.9798,"pubmed, wos",Oncology,cervical cancer; papillomavirus infections; acetic acid; Lugol's iodine; anxiety,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/cancer.9798)

"Benefits, Recruitment, Dropout, and Acceptability of the Strength Back Digital Health Intervention for Patients Undergoing Spinal Surgery: Nonrandomized, Qualitative, and Quantitative Pilot Feasibility Study",Not mental health,"van der Horst, A; Meijer, L; van Os-Medendorp, H; Jukema, JS; Bohlmeijer, E; Schreurs, KMG; Kelders, S",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2024,"Background: Patients undergoing spinal surgery report high levels of insecurity, pain, stress, and anxiety before and after surgery. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that surgery will resolve all issues; postsurgical recovery often entails moderate to severe postoperative pain, and some patients undergoing spinal surgery do not experience (long-term) pain relief after surgery. Therefore, focusing on sustainable coping skills and resilience is crucial for these patients. A digital health intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and positive psychology (PP) was developed to enhance psychological flexibility and well-being and reduce postsurgical pain. Objective: The objective of this study was 3 -fold: to explore the potential benefits for patients undergoing spinal surgery of the digital ACT and PP intervention Strength Back (research question [RQ] 1), explore the feasibility of a future randomized controlled trial in terms of recruitment and dropout (RQ 2), and assess the acceptability of Strength Back by patients undergoing spinal surgery (RQ 3). Methods: We used a nonrandomized experimental design with an intervention group (n=17) and a control group (n=20). To explore the potential benefits of the intervention, participants in both groups filled out questionnaires before and after surgery. These questionnaires included measurements of pain intensity (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), pain interference (Multidimensional Pain Inventory), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), valued living (Engaged Living Scale), psychological flexibility (Psychological Inflexibility in Pain Scale), and mental well-being (Mental Health Continuum-Short Form). Semistructured interviews combined with log data and scores on the Twente Engagement With eHealth Technologies Scale were used to assess the acceptability of the intervention. Results: A significant improvement over time in emotional (V=99; P=.03) and overall (V=55; P=.004) well-being (Mental Health Continuum-Short Form) was observed only in the intervention group. In addition, the intervention group showed a significantly larger decline in pain intensity (Numeric Pain Rating Scale) than did the control group (U=75; P=.003). Of the available weekly modules on average 80% (12/15) was completed by patients undergoing spinal fusion and 67% (6/9) was completed by patients undergoing decompression surgery. A total of 68% (17/25) of the participants used the intervention until the final interview. Most participants (15/17, 88%) in the intervention group would recommend the intervention to future patients. Conclusions: This pilot feasibility study showed that combining ACT and PP in a digital health intervention is promising for patients undergoing spinal surgery as the content was accepted by most of the participants and (larger) improvements in pain intensity and well-being were observed in the intervention group. A digital intervention for patients undergoing (spinal) surgery can use teachable moments, when patients are open to learning more about the surgery and rehabilitation afterward.

Coping with this new situation can be difficult, which may result in a variety of physical and psychosocial problems. It is essential to provide adequate guidance to help patients cope with their stoma, as this positively influences self-efficacy in return. Higher self-efficacy reduces psychosocial problems increasing patient's quality of life. This study investigates whether a new mobile application, the Stoma App, improves quality of life. And if personalized guidance, timed support, and peer contact offered as an in-app surplus makes a difference.Methods A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted between March 2021 and April 2023. Patients aged > 18 years undergoing ileostomy or colostomy surgery, in possession of a compatible smartphone were included. The intervention group received the full version of the app containing personalized and time guidance, peer support, and generic (non-personalized) stoma-related information. The control group received a restricted version with only generic information. Primary outcome was stoma quality of life. Secondary outcomes included psychological adaption, complications, re-admittance, reoperations, and length of hospital stay.Results The intervention version of the app was used by 96 patients and the control version by 112 patients. After correction for confounding, the intervention group reported a significant 3.1-point improvement in stoma-related quality of life one month postoperatively (p = 0.038).

Between the Library and Lectures: How Can Nature Be Integrated Into University Infrastructure to Improve Students' Mental Health,Not Multi User,"Boyd, F",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2022,"The university campus provides the backdrop to a student's education and social journey. For many students, the transition from secondary school through to graduation can be one of upheaval, geographical, financial and social change. Evidence suggests increasing levels of mental health difficulties among UK university students. The university campus is a possible resource to mitigate wellbeing issues through facilitating the salutogenic effects of engagement with nature. This mixed method research examines the opportunity to integrate nature through interventions for University of Sheffield undergraduate students. It uses a green prescription style activity and a specially designed mobile phone app. Through focus groups the participants' experience reveals the necessity for a whole university approach that considers intervention and campus design simultaneously. This study's findings qualify research into young adult's experience of urban green spaces and their tangible connection to plants such as trees. Policy and practice implications include the requirement for a coherent approach to understanding the place-attachment aspects to nature in the university environment. Further afield, there is a need for collaborative wellbeing interventions and urban green space development within the UK context.",10.3389/fpsyg.2022.865422,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,nature-based interventions; urban nature; student wellbeing; university; place attachment,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.865422)

However, evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of information and communication technology in the context of integrated care models is relatively scarce. Objective: The objective of our study was to provide evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the BeyondSilos project for patients enrolled in the Badalona city pilot site in Spain. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of information and communication technology-enhanced integration of health and social care, including the third sector (intervention), compared to basic health and social care coordination (comparator). The study was conducted in Badalona between 2015 and 2016. Participants were followed for 8 months. Results: The study included 198 patients: 98 in the intervention group and 100 in the comparator group. The mean Barthel index remained unchanged in the intervention group (mean change 0.14, 95% CI -4.51 to 4.78; P=.95) but decreased in the comparator group (mean change -3.23, 95% CI -5.34 to -1.11; P=.003). Instrumental Activities of Daily Living significantly decreased in both groups: mean changes of -0.23 (95% CI -0.44 to -0.02; P=.03) and -0.33 (95% CI -0.46 to -0.20; P<.001) in the intervention and comparator groups, respectively.

MethodsPatients with CLBP completed validated baseline and post-intervention assessments of pain intensity and interference (Brief Pain Inventory), back pain-related disability (Oswestry Disability Index), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Participants underwent a series of Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) procedures assessing responses to mechanical stimuli during two separate visits (baseline and post-intervention). In addition, we assessed, using surface EMG, the muscle tension in the trapezius, latissimus, and low back muscles at each session. Patients were randomized into the EMG biofeedback intervention or usual care group. Factorial analysis of variance including the interaction between treatment group and time was used to analyze the changes in pain intensity (primary outcome), pain interference, disability (secondary outcomes), anxiety, and depression (secondary outcomes). ResultsCompared to the treatment as usual comparison group, patients in the EMG biofeedback group reported lower pain intensity after completing the intervention (mean group difference 0.9, 95% CI -1.07, -0.32; p <= 0.01). Compared to baseline, participants in the EMG biofeedback group demonstrated statistically significant reductions in pain interference (mean difference 1.3, 95% CI 0.42, 2.1; p <= 0.01), disability (mean difference 4.32, 95% CI 1.2, 7.3; p <= 0.01), and significant increases in low back pain thresholds (mean difference 0.5, 95% CI -0.87, -0.05; p <= 0.01), assessed by QST. However, no significant group by time effects were observed for secondary outcomes: pain interference, disability, and low back pain thresholds. In addition, significant changes were observed in muscle tension for the trapezius, latissimus, and low back muscles in the EMG biofeedback group (p<0.001).

Blending Video Therapy and Digital Self-Help for Individuals With Suicidal Ideation: Intervention Design and a Qualitative Study Within the Development Process,Not Multi User,"Buescher, R; Sander, LB; Nuding, M; Baumeister, H; Teismann, T",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Digital formats have the potential to enhance accessibility to care for individuals with suicidal ideation. However, digital self-help interventions have faced limitations, including small effect sizes in reducing suicidal ideation, low adherence, and safety concerns. Objective: Therefore, we aimed to develop a remote blended cognitive behavioral therapy intervention that specifically targets suicidal ideation by blending video therapy with web-based self-help modules. The objective of this paper is to describe the collaborative development process and the resulting intervention and treatment rationale. Methods: First, we compiled intervention components from established treatment manuals designed for people with suicidal ideation or behavior, resulting in the development of 11 drafts of web-based modules. Second, we conducted a qualitative study, involving 5 licensed psychotherapists and 3 lay counselors specialized in individuals with suicidal ideation who reviewed these module drafts. Data were collected using the think-aloud method and semistructured interviews, and a qualitative content analysis was performed. The 4 a priori main categories of interest were blended care for individuals with suicidal ideation, contents of web-based modules, usability of modules, and layout. Subcategories emerged inductively from the interview transcripts. Finally, informed by previous treatment manuals and qualitative findings, we developed the remote blended treatment program. Results: The participants suggested that therapists should thoroughly prepare the web-based therapy with patients to tailor the therapy to each individual's needs. Participants emphasized that the web-based modules should explain concepts in a simple manner, convey empathy and validation, and include reminders for the safety plan. In addition, participants highlighted the need for a simple navigation and layout. Taking these recommendations into account, we developed a fully remote blended cognitive behavioral therapy intervention comprising 12 video therapy sessions and up to 31 web-based modules. The treatment involves collaboratively developing a personalized treatment plan to address individual suicidal drivers. Conclusions: This remote treatment takes advantage of the high accessibility of digital formats while incorporating full sessions with a therapist. In a subsequent pilot trial, we will seek input from individuals with lived experience and therapists to test the feasibility of the treatment.

Blending group-based psychoeducation with a smartphone intervention for the reduction of depressive symptoms: results of a randomized controlled pilot study,Good,"Lukas, CA; Berking, M",PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES,2021,"Background: Given their ubiquity and technological facilities, smartphone-based interventions (SBIs) hold potential to support the cost-effective dissemination of evidence-based treatments for depression. As technologically enriched, blended approach-avoidance modification trainings (AAMTs) have recently been shown effective for symptom reduction in various mental health problems, we developed a blended SBI combining group-based psychoeducation and 14 days of app training utilizing principles from AAMT to reduce depressive symptoms. Methods: In this pilot trial, N = 16 individuals with heightened depression scores were randomized to either an intervention group using the mentalis Phoenix app or a wait list control condition. As outcomes, we descriptively explored usability of the app, engagement with the intervention, and possible reductions of depressive symptoms. Results: Data analyses suggest that the SBI tested in this pilot trial possesses high usability, is frequently engaged with, and reduces depressive symptoms in participants in the intervention group when compared to wait list controls. Conclusions: This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that an SBI utilizing AAMT can reduce depressive symptoms.

Boosting Empathy and Compassion Through Mindfulness-Based and Socioemotional Dyadic Practice: Randomized Controlled Trial With App-Delivered Trainings,Good,"Silveira, S; Godara, M; Singer, T",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Contemplative trainings have been found to effectively improve social skills such as empathy and compassion. However, there is a lack of research on the efficacy of app-delivered mindfulness-based and dyadic practices in boosting socioaffective capacity.Objective: The first aim of this study was to compare a novel app-delivered, partner-based socioemotional intervention (Affect Dyad) with mindfulness-based training to foster empathy and compassion for the self or others. The second aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these effects. Methods: This randomized controlled trial included socioemotional and mindfulness-based interventions and a waitlist control group, which received socioemotional training after the postintervention assessment. We used linear mixed-effects models to test intervention effects on self-report measures and an ecologically valid computer task of empathy, compassion for the self and others, and theory of mind. Moderated mediation models were used to investigate whether changes in acceptance, empathic distress, empathic listening, interoceptive awareness, and mindfulness served as underlying psychological processes of intervention effects. Results: In 218 participants (mean age 44.12, SD 11.71 years; 160/218, 73.4% female), we found all interventions to have positive effects on composite scores for compassion toward the self (beta socioemotional=.44, P<.001; beta waitlist socioemotional=.30, P=.002; & beta;mindfulness-based=.35, P<.001) and others (& beta;socioemotional=.24, P=.003; & beta;waitlist socioemotional=.35, P<.001; & beta;mindfulness-based=.29, P<.001). Compassion measured with the computer task did not change significantly but showed a trend toward increase only in socioemotional dyadic practice (beta socioemotional=.08, P=.08; & beta;waitlist socioemotional=.11, P=.06). Similarly, on the empathic concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, a nonsignificant trend toward increase was found in the socioemotional intervention group (beta socioemotional=.17; P=.08). Empathy significantly increased in both socioemotional groups (& beta; socioemotional=.16, P=.03 beta waitlist socioemotional=.35, P<.001) and the mindfulness-based group (& beta;mindfulness-based=.15; P=.04). The measures of theory of mind did not change over time. In the mindfulness-based group, the increase in self-compassion was mediated by a decrease in empathic distress (indirect effect abmindfulness-based=0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.14). In the socioemotional group, an increase in self-compassion could be predicted by an increase in acceptance (beta socioemotional=6.63, 95% CI 0.52-12.38). Conclusions: Using a multimethod approach, this study shows that app-delivered socioemotional and mindfulness-based trainings are effective in fostering compassion for the self and others in self-report. Both low-dose trainings could boost behavioral empathy markers; however, the effects on behavioral and dispositional markers of compassion only trended after dyadic practice, yet these effects did not reach statistical significance. Training-related increases in self-compassion rely on differential psychological processes, that is, on improved empathic distress regulation through mindfulness-based training and the activation of a human care- and acceptance-based system through socioemotional dyadic training.",10.2196/45027,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,mental training; compassion; empathy; mindfulness; dyadic practice; acceptance; digital mental health; self-compassion; app-delivered training; Affect Dyad; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/45027)
Bridging the digital divide: A comparison of use and effectiveness of an online intervention for depression between Baby Boomers and Millennials,Not Multi User,"Schneider, BC; Schröder, J; Berger, T; Hohagen, F; Meyer, B; Späth, C; Greiner, W; Hautzinger, M; Lutz, W; Rose, M; Vettorazzi, E; Moritz, S; Klein, JP",JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,2018,"Background: Psychological online interventions (POIs) for depression have demonstrated promising effects. However, there are fewer randomized controlled studies on POIs among older adults with depression. The goal of the present study was to compare the use and efficacy of Deprexis, an online intervention for depression, among Millennials (18-35 years) and Baby Boomers (50-65 years). Methods: We completed a secondary data analysis on a subset (N = 577) of participants in the EVIDENT trial, a parallel-groups, pragmatic, randomized, controlled single-blind study, which compared a 12-week POI (Deprexis) to care as usual (CAU). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months (post-assessment) and 6 months (follow-up). The main outcome of interest was change on self-rated depression severity (PHQ-9). Results: Compared to Millennials, Boomers used the intervention significantly more often (d = 0.45) and for a longer duration (d = 0.46), and endorsed more positive attitudes towards POIs (d = 0.14). There was no significant Age Group by Intervention Group interaction for change in PHQ-9. The post-assessment between-group effect size (intervention vs. CAU control) for Millennials and Boomers were d = 0.26 and d = 0.39, respectively, and were stable at follow-up (d = 0.37 and d = 0.39). Limitations: Age-based dichotomization may not accurately represent participants' experiences with and use of technology. Conclusions: The POI examined in this trial was superior to CAU and was comparably effective among groups of adults defined as Millennials and Baby Boomers.

Brief App-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety Symptoms in Psychiatric Inpatients: Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Sharma, G; Schlosser, L; Jones, BDM; Blumberger, DM; Gratzer, D; Husain, MO; Mulsant, BH; Rappaport, L; Stergiopoulos, V; Husain, MI",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Psychiatric inpatients often have limited access to psychotherapeutic education or skills for managing anxiety, a common transdiagnostic concern in severe and acute mental illness. COVID-19-related restrictions further limited access to therapy groups on inpatient psychiatric units. App-based interventions may improve access, but evidence supporting the feasibility of their use, acceptability, and effectiveness in psychiatric inpatient settings is limited. MindShift CBT is a free app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles with evidence for alleviating anxiety symptoms in the outpatient setting. Objective: We aimed to recruit 24 participants from an acute general psychiatric inpatient ward to a 1-month randomized control study assessing the feasibility and acceptability of providing patients with severe and acute mental illness access to the MindShift CBT app for help with managing anxiety symptoms. Methods: Recruitment, data collection, analysis, and interpretation were completed collaboratively by clinician and peer researchers. Inpatients were randomized to two conditions: treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU plus use of the MindShift CBT app over 6 days. We collected demographic and quantitative data on acceptability and usability of the intervention. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress were measured in pre- and poststudy surveys for preliminary signals of efficacy. We conducted individual semistructured interviews with participants in the MindShift CBT app group at the end of their trial period, which were interpreted using a standardized protocol for thematic analysis. Results: Over 4 weeks, 33 inpatients were referred to the study, 24 consented to participate, 20 were randomized, and 11 completed the study. Of the 9 randomized participants who did not complete the study, 7 were withdrawn because they were discharged or transferred prior to study completion, with a similar distribution among both conditions. Among the enrolled patients, 65% (13/20) were admitted for a psychotic disorder and no patient was admitted primarily for an anxiety disorder. The average length of stay was 20 days (SD 4.4; range 3-21) and 35% (7/20) of patients were involuntarily admitted to hospital. Small sample sizes limited accurate interpretation of the efficacy data. Themes emerging from qualitative interviews included acceptability and usability of the app, and patient agency associated with voluntary participation in research while admitted to hospital. Conclusions: Our study benefitted from collaboration between peer and clinician researchers. Due to rapid patient turnover in the acute inpatient setting, additional flexibility in recruitment and enrollment is needed to determine the efficacy of using app-based psychotherapy on an acute psychiatric ward. Despite the limited sample size, our study suggests that similar interventions may be feasible and acceptable for acutely unwell inpatients. Further study is needed to compare the efficacy of psychotherapeutic apps with existing standards of care in this setting.",10.2196/38460,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,inpatient; mental health; mental disorder; psychiatry; psychiatric; smartphone app; cognitive behavioral therapy; CBT; anxiety; mobile app; mobile health; mHealth; health app; digital health; eHealth; feasibility study; randomized controlled trial; RCT; feasibility; acceptability,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/38460)
Brief Digital Interventions to Support the Psychological Well-being of NHS Staff During the COVID-19 Pandemic: 3-Arm Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,Population,"De Kock, JH; Latham, HA; Cowden, RG; Cullen, B; Narzisi, K; Jerdan, S; Munoz, SA; Leslie, SJ; Stamatis, A; Eze, J",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2022,"Background: Health and social care staff are at high risk of experiencing adverse mental health (MH) outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, there is a need to prioritize and identify ways to effectively support their psychological well-being (PWB). Compared to traditional psychological interventions, digital psychological interventions are cost-effective treatment options that allow for large-scale dissemination and transcend social distancing, overcome rurality, and minimize clinician time. Objective: This study reports MH outcomes of a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)-compliant parallel-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the potential usefulness of an existing and a novel digital psychological intervention aimed at supporting psychological health among National Health Service (NHS) staff working through the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: NHS Highland (NHSH) frontline staff volunteers (N=169) were randomly assigned to the newly developed NHSH Staff Wellbeing Project (NHSWBP), an established digital intervention (My Possible Self [MPS]), or a waitlist (WL) group for 4 weeks. Attempts were made to blind participants to which digital intervention they were allocated. The interventions were fully automated, without any human input or guidance. We measured 5 self-reported psychological outcomes over 3 time points: before (baseline), in the middle of (after 2 weeks), and after treatment (4 weeks). The primary outcomes were anxiety (7-item General Anxiety Disorder), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire), and mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). The secondary outcomes included mental toughness (Mental Toughness Index) and gratitude (Gratitude Questionnaire-6). Results: Retention rates mid-and postintervention were 77% (n=130) and 63.3% (n=107), respectively. Postintervention, small differences were noted between the WL and the 2 treatment groups on anxiety (vs MPS: Cohen d=0.07, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.33; vs NHSWBP: Cohen d=0.06, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.31), depression (vs MPS: Cohen d=0.37, 95% CI 0.07-0.66; vs NHSWBP: Cohen d=0.18, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.46), and mental well-being (vs MPS: Cohen d=-0.04, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.08; vs NHSWBP: Cohen d=-0.15, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.10). A similar pattern of between-group differences was found for the secondary outcomes. The NHSWBP group generally had larger within-group effects than the other groups and displayed a greater rate of change compared to the other groups on all outcomes, except for gratitude, where the rate of change was greatest for the MPS group. Conclusions: Our analyses provided encouraging results for the use of brief digital psychological interventions in improving PWB among health and social care workers.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate if a brief self-guided, online psychological intervention can reduce the degree of dysfunctional worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated symptoms. Methods: 670 adults from the Swedish general population reporting daily uncontrollable worry about CO-VID-19 and its possible consequences (e.g., illness, death, the economy, one's family) were randomised (1:1 ratio) to a 3-week self-guided, online cognitive behavioural intervention targeting dysfunctional COVID-19 worry and associated symptoms, or a waiting list of equal duration. The primary outcome measure was a COVID-19 adapted version of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale administered at baseline and weeks 1-3 (primary endpoint).

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increases in maternal depression and anxiety and has presented unique parenting stressors. Although early intervention is crucial, there are significant barriers to accessing care.Methods To inform a larger randomized controlled trial, the current open-pilot trial investigated initial evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a newly developed online group therapy and app-based mental health and parenting program (BEAM) for mothers of infants. Forty-six mothers 18 years or older with clinically elevated depression scores, with an infant aged 6-17 months old, and who lived in Manitoba or Alberta were enrolled in the 10-week program (starting in July 2021) and completed self-report surveys.Results The majority of participants engaged in each of the program components at least once and participants indicated relatively high levels of app satisfaction, ease of use, and usefulness. However, there was a high level of attrition (46%). Paired-sample t-tests indicated significant pre- to post-intervention change in maternal depression, anxiety, and parenting stress, and in child internalizing, but not externalizing symptoms. Effect sizes were in the medium to high range, with the largest effect size observed for depressive symptoms (Cohen's d = .93).Discussion This study shows moderate levels of feasibility and strong preliminary efficacy of the BEAM program.

Many individuals may now be at heightened risk of postpartum mental health disorders. There are significant concerns that a cohort of children may be at-risk for impaired self-regulation and mental illness due to elevated exposure to perinatal mental illness. With both an increased prevalence of depression and limited availability of services due to the pandemic, there is an urgent need for accessible eHealth interventions for mothers of young children. The aims of this trial are to evaluate the efficacy of the Building Emotion Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM) app-based program for reducing maternal depression symptoms (primary outcome) and improve anxiety symptoms, parenting stress, family relationships, and mother and child functioning (secondary outcomes) compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Methods: A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the BEAM intervention compared to TAU among a sample of 140 mothers with children aged 18 to 36 months, who selfreport moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Individuals will be recruited online, and those randomized to the treatment group will participate in 10 weeks of psychoeducation modules, an online social support forum, and weekly group teletherapy sessions. Assessments will occur at 18-36 months postpartum (pre-test, T1), immediately after the last week of the BEAM intervention (post-test, T2), and at 3 months after the intervention (follow-up, T3). Discussion: eHealth interventions have the potential to address elevated maternal mental health symptoms, parenting stress, and child functioning concerns during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide accessible programming to mothers who are in need of support. This RCT will build on an open pilot trial of the BEAM program and provide further evaluation of this evidence-based intervention.

The extant literature supports exercise as a potent behaviour that can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in clinical and non-clinical populations. Objective Using a suite of mobile applications, at-home exercise, including high intensity interval training (HIIT) and/or yoga, was completed to reduce depressive symptoms in the general population in the early months of the pandemic. Methods A 6-week, parallel, multiarm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial was completed with four groups: (1) HIIT, (2) Yoga, (3) HIIT+yoga, and (4) waitlist control (WLC). Low active, English-speaking, non-retired Canadians aged 18-64 years were included. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline and weekly following randomisation. Results A total of 334 participants were randomised to one of four groups. No differences in depressive symptoms were evident at baseline. The results of latent growth modelling showed significant treatment effects in depressive symptoms for each active group compared with the WLC, with small effect sizes (ESs) in the community-based sample of participants. Treatment groups were not significantly different from each other. Effect sizes were very large (eg, week 6 ES range=-2.34 to -2.52) when restricting the analysis only to participants with high depressive symptoms at baseline.

We sought to develop a research agenda to understand the short- and long-term mechanisms and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's healthy development, with the goal of devising and ultimately testing interventions to respond to urgent needs and prepare for future pandemics. Description The Life Course Intervention Research Network facilitated a series of virtual meetings that included members of 10 Maternal and Child Health (MCH) research programs, their research and implementation partners, as well as family and community representatives, to develop an MCH COVID-19 Research Agenda. Stakeholders from academia, clinical practice, nonprofit organizations, and family advocates participated in four meetings, with 30-35 participants at each meeting. Assessment Investigating the impacts of COVID-19 on children's mental health and ways to address them emerged as the highest research priority, followed by studying resilience at individual and community levels; identifying and mitigating the disparate negative effects of the pandemic on children and families of color, prioritizing community-based research partnerships, and strengthening local, state and national measurement systems to monitor children's well-being during a national crisis. Conclusion Enacting this research agenda will require engaging the community, especially youth, as equal partners in research co-design processes; centering anti-racist perspectives; adopting a strengths-based approach; and integrating young researchers who identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC).

COVID-19 loss of taste and smell: potential psychological repercussions,Other,"Javed, N; Ijaz, Z; Khair, AH; Dar, AA; Lopez, ED; Abbas, R; Sheikh, A",PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL,2022,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a cause for global concern. Apart from a multitude of symptoms, the virus is known for its ability to cause loss of taste and smell that can be irreversible in a few cases. In fact, even after recovery, post-covid syndrome can still lead to devastating outcomes, specifically with reference to loss of smell and taste. A number of mechanisms that have been postulated include receptor-mediated uptake, increased inflammation, transneuronal migration, and direct damage to the olfactory pathway. Considering how important these two senses are, many psychological, social, and emotional repercussions can be expected. These repercussions include lowering of self-esteem and developmental of mental health issues. Long-term altered taste sensation can also lead to the development of unhealthy eating habits that can result in increasing risk for diabetes and hypertension. A few solutions have been investigated for treating these chemosensory dysfunctions, such as olfactory training, corticosteroids, theophylline and acupuncture. Although the results have been promising but a new modality, virtual reality, requires more in-depth exploration because it targets not only the dysfunction but also the mental health issues being experienced. It is important that affected individuals be provided with strong emotional and family support.

"COVID-19-related uncertainty: fertility staff experiences of its sources, processing, responses, and consequences",Not Digital,"Gameiro, S; Armstrong, K; Carluke, N; Baccino, G; Zegers-Hochschild, F; Boivin, J",HUMAN REPRODUCTION,2023,"STUDY QUESTION What are fertility staff experiences of managing COVID-19-related uncertainty after fertility clinics re-opened? SUMMARY ANSWER Staff identified many COVID-19-related uncertainty sources, the main being the COVID-19 health threat, to which most clinics and staff responded effectively by implementing safety protocols and building strong collaborative environments that facilitated the acquisition and application of information to guide organizational responses during a rapidly changing situation, but with costs for staff and patients. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY COVID-19 created significant disruption in fertility care delivery, including temporary clinic closure and treatment delay. Patients experienced significant distress, including concerns regarding the impact of COVID-19 and its vaccine on fertility and pregnancy. Multiple studies show that COVID-19-related uncertainty is a major threat and burden for healthcare staff, but this has not been investigated in reproductive medicine. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A cross-sectional, online mixed-method bilingual (English, Spanish) survey (active 25 January-23 May 2021) was distributed to fertility staff across the UK, Latin America, and Africa. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Eligibility criteria were being a healthcare worker at a fertility clinic that had re-opened since its COVID-19-related closure, 18 years of age or older and ability to respond in English or Spanish. The survey was created in English, translated to Spanish, made available using Qualtrics, and consisted of four parts: (i) background and physical and mental wellbeing, (ii) open-ended questions regarding COVID-19 uncertainty, (iii) appraisal items regarding perceptions and impact of uncertainty, and (iv) changes in the workplace. The British Fertility Society and the African Network and Registry of Assisted Reproduction circulated the survey across the UK and Africa via email hyperlinks and social media platforms. The Argentinian Society of Reproductive Medicine and the Latin American Network of Assisted Reproduction distributed the survey across Latin America in the same manner. Thematic analysis was performed on responses from open-ended question to produce basic codes. Deductive coding grouped sub-themes across questions into themes related to the theory of uncertainty management. Descriptive statistics and repeated measures analysis of variance were used on the quantitative data. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE In total, 382 staff consented to the survey, 107 did not complete (28% attrition), and 275 completed. Sixty-three percent were women, 69% were physicians, and 79% worked at private clinics. Thematic analysis produced 727 codes, organized in 92 sub-themes, and abstracted into 18 themes and one meta-theme reflecting that uncertainty is stressful but manageable. The types of uncertainties related to the threat of COVID-19 (20.6%), unpredictability of the future (19.5%), failure of communication (11.4%), and change in the workplace (8.4%). Staff appraisals of negative and positive impact of uncertainty were significantly lower (P < 0.001) than appraisals of stress, controllability, and having what it takes to cope with uncertainty. To process uncertainty, clinics focused on information dissemination (30.8%) and building a collaborative work environment (5.8%), while staff employed proactive coping (41.8%) and emotional and cognitive processing (9.6%). Main organizational responses consisted on work restructuring (41.3%, e.g. safety protocols), adapting to adversity (9.5%, e.g. supplies, preparation), and welfare support (13.8%), though staff perceived lack of support (17.5%). Negative consequences of uncertainty were worse self- and patient welfare (12.1%) and worse communication due to virtual medicine and use of mask (9.6%). Positive consequences were work improvements (8.3%), organizational adaptation (8.3%), improved relationships (5.6%), and individual adaptation (3.2%). Ninety-two percent of participants thought changes experienced in the workplace due to COVID-19 were negative, 9.1% nor negative nor positive, and 14.9% positive. Most staff thought that their physical (92.4%) and mental health (89.5%) were good to excellent. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Participants were self-selected, and most were physicians and embryologists working at private clinics based in Latin America. The study did not account for how variability in national and regional COVID-19 policy shaped staff experiences of uncertainty. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS To address COVID-19 uncertainty, clinics need to promote collaborative (clinic, staff, patients) processing of uncertainty, clear team coordination and communication, organizational flexibility, and provision of support to staff and patients, with an emphasis on cognitive coping to decrease threat of and increase tolerance to uncertainty. Uncertainty management interventions bespoke to fertility care that integrate these components may increase clinics resilience to COVID-19-related and other types of uncertainty.

The research agenda posits the following questions. Questions around HIV infection, transmission, and diagnosis include: (i) molecular, genetic, clinical, and environmental assessments of COVID-19 in people living with HIV, (ii) alternative options for facility-based HIV testing services such as self- and home-based HIV testing, and (iii) COVID-19 related sexual violence and mental health on HIV transmission and early diagnosis. These and related questions could be assessed using Biopsychosocial and socio-ecological models. Questions around HIV treatment include: (i) the effect of COVID-19 on HIV treatment services, (ii) alternative options for facility-based treatment provision such as community-based antiretroviral therapy groups, and (iii) equitable distribution of treatment and vaccines for COVID-19, if successful. Bickman's logic model and the social determinants of health framework could guide these issues. The impact of stigma, the role of leveraging lessons on sustained intra-behavioral change, the role of medical mistrust and conspiracy beliefs, and the role of digital health on integrated management of HIV care and spectrum of care of COVID-19 need assessment using several frameworks including Goffman's stigma framework, Luhmann's Trust theory, and Gidden's theory of structuration.

Can We Foster a Culture of Peer Support and Promote Mental Health in Adolescence Using a Web-Based App? A Control Group Study,Good,"Bohleber, L; Crameri, A; Eich-Stierli, B; Telesko, R; von Wyl, A",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2016,"Background: Adolescence with its many transitions is a vulnerable period for the development of mental illnesses. Establishing effective mental health promotion programs for this age group is a challenge crucial to societal health. Programs must account for the specific developmental tasks that adolescents face. Considering peer influence and fostering adolescent autonomy strivings is essential. Participation in a program should be compelling to young people, and their affinity to new technologies offers unprecedented opportunities in this respect. Objective: The Companion App was developed as a Web-based app giving adolescents access to a peer mentoring system and interactive, health-relevant content to foster a positive peer culture among adolescents and thereby strengthen social support and reduce stress. Methods: In a control group study design, a group of employed (n=546) and unemployed (n=73) adolescents had access to the Companion App during a 10-month period. The intervention was evaluated using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze changes in chronic stress levels and perception of social support. Monthly feedback on the app and qualitative interviews at the end of the study allowed for an in-depth exploration of the adolescents' perception of the intervention. Results: Adolescents in the intervention group did not use the Companion App consistently. The intervention had no significant effect on chronic stress levels or the perception of social support. Adolescents reported endorsing the concept of the app and the implementation of a peer mentoring system in particular. However, technical difficulties and insufficiently obvious benefits of using the app impeded more frequent usage. Conclusions: The Companion Project implemented a theory-driven and innovative approach to mental health promotion in adolescence, taking into account the specifics of this developmental phase. Particularities of the implementation context, technical aspects of the app, and insufficient incentives may have played considerable roles concerning the difficulties of the Companion Project to establish commitment. However, adopting peer mentoring as a strategy and using an app still seems to us a promising approach in mental health promotion in adolescents. Future projects should be careful to invest enough resources into the technical development of an app and consider a large use of incentives to establish commitment. When targeting risk groups, such as unemployed adolescents, it may be expedient to use more structured approaches including face-to-face support.",10.2196/mental.5597,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,mental health; health promotion; mobile applications; adolescence; peer group; mentors,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/mental.5597)

We hypothesized that the addition of a novel post-discharge mobile app specific to thoracic surgery to an existing home care program would reduce ED visits and readmissions compared to a home care program alone. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing major lung resection for malignant disease between November 2016 and May 2018. Patients received either home care alone (control group) or home care plus a patient-input mobile app (intervention group). Primary outcomes were 30-day readmission and ED visit rates. Secondary outcomes included reasons for ED visits and readmissions, perioperative complications, 30-day mortality, anxiety (assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale [GAD-7]) and app-related adverse events. We compared outcomes between the 2 groups, analyzing the data on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: Despite the greater number of open surgery and anatomic resections in the intervention cohort, patients in that group were less likely than those in the control group to visit the ED within 30 days of discharge (24.0% v. 38.8%, p = 0.02). Thirty-day readmission rates were similar between the intervention and control groups (10.1% v. 12.2%, p = 0.6). In a subset of patients, there was no difference between the 2 groups in the proportion of patients with a GAD-7 score of 0 (control group 79.8%, intervention group 79.5%, p = NS), which indicated a similar absence of postdischarge anxiety and depression symptoms in the 2 cohorts. Conclusion: The addition of a mobile app to a home care program after thoracic surgery was associated with a reduced frequency of ED visits, in spite of the higher proportions of thoracotomies and anatomic resections in the app cohort.

The aim of our study is to evaluate the effects of robotic neurorehabilitation using Lokomat with and without VR on cognitive functioning and psychological well-being in stroke patients, as compared to traditional therapy. Methods: Ninety stroke patients were included in this randomized controlled clinical trial. The patients were assigned to one of the three treatment groups, i.e. the Robotic Rehabilitation group undergoing robotic rehab with VR (RRG+VR), the Robotic Rehabilitation Group (RRG-VR) using robotics without VR, and the Conventional Rehabilitation group (CRG) submitted to conventional physiotherapy and cognitive treatment. Results: The analysis showed that either the robotic training (with and without VR) or the conventional rehabilitation led to significant improvements in the global cognitive functioning, mood, and executive functions, as well as in activities of daily living. However, only in the RRG +VR we observed a significant improvement in cognitive flexibility and shifting skills, selective attention/visual research, and quality of life, with regard to the perception of the mental and physical state. Conclusion: Our study shows that robotic treatment, especially if associated with VR, may positively affect cognitive recovery and psychological well-being in patients with chronic stroke, thanks to the complex interation between movement and cognition.

Can the Mixed Virtual Reality Simulator Into D'mentia Enhance Empathy and Understanding and Decrease Burden in Informal Dementia Caregivers?,Not Multi User,"Jütten, LH; Mark, RE; Sitskoorn, MM",DEMENTIA AND GERIATRIC COGNITIVE DISORDERS EXTRA,2018,"Objective: To evaluate whether the mixed virtual reality dementia simulator training Into D'mentia increased informal caregivers' understanding for people with dementia, their empathy, sense of competence, relationship quality with the care receiver, and/or decreased burden, depression, and anxiety. Methods: A quasi-experimental longitudinal study with an intervention group (n = 145) and a control group (n = 56) was conducted. All participants were informal caregivers of people with dementia. They completed six questionnaires and semi-structured interviews 1 week before as well as 1 week, 2.5 months, and 15 months after the training. Data were analyzed on both group and individual level using linear mixed model analyses and Reliable Change Indices. Results: Eighty-five percent of the participants in the intervention group found the intervention useful; 76% said they had changed their approach to caregiving, and 61% stressed that the intervention had increased their understanding of dementia. No significant differences were found between the two groups over time regarding empathy, sense of competence, relationship quality with the care receiver, burden, depression, and anxiety, at either group or individual level. Conclusion: Caregivers indicated that the Into D'mentia intervention improved their understanding of dementia, that they had learned to be more patient, to take things more slowly, and to focus on positive aspects of caregiving. However, no significant change was found on the variables assessed via the questionnaires. Future research can consider enriching this intervention with other aspects such as more educational material, more simulations, and group sessions, tailored to the individual caregiver and his/her situation, and examine whether these new interventions yield change on questionnaires. These new, more personalized interventions for dementia caregivers could help caregivers to better understand the persons with dementia they care for and to ultimately enhance the well-being of both caregivers and persons with dementia.

Can virtual reality reduce pain and anxiety in pediatric emergency care and promote positive response of parents of children? A quasi-experimental study,Not Multi User,"Ferraz-Torres, M; Soto-Ruiz, N; Escalada-Hernández, P; García-Vivar, C; San Martín-Rodríguez, L",INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY NURSING,2023,Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality to reduce pain and anxiety in pediatric patients during venipuncture procedure in emergency care and the behavioral response of their parents/companions. Background: Virtual reality is being used as a source of distraction in children undergoing invasive procedures. Methods: Quasi-experimental study with 458 children (from 2 to 15 years) who attended a pediatric emergency service from September 2019 to April 2021. An intervention based on virtual reality as a distraction method during venipuncture procedure was applied. The level of pain and anxiety of children and attitude of parents/ companions were assessed. Ordinal and binary logistic regressions were applied. Results: A protective effect of using virtual reality was observed in the intervention group both for the absence of pain (-4.12; 95 % CI:-4.85 to-3.40) and anxiety (-1.71; 95 % CI:-2.24 to-1.17) in children aged between 2 and 15 years. A significant reduction in the blocking response of the accompanying parents (-2.37; 95 % CI:-3.017 to-1.723) was also observed. Conclusions: VR is effective in reducing pain and anxiety in children during venipuncture in emergency care.

"Capacity limitations in neurology patients, with and without comorbid mental disorders",Other,"Neue, DC; Linden, M; Muschalla, B",JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH,2022,"Background: According to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) symptoms of illness and capacity limitations must be kept apart and assessed separately. Psychological capacities are more important than physical capacities in today's world. Patients with neurological disorders not only show limitations in physical but also in psychological capacities. As in many cases there is comorbidity of neurological and mental disorders the question is to what degree this can increase psychological incapacity.Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, neurological patients with and without mental comorbidity were recruited in a department of neurological phase D rehabilitation. A total of 114 inpatients with both neurological and mental disorders (NM) were compared with 214 unselected patients with neurological disorders only (N). Mental comorbidity was diagnosed with the standardized International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Capacity limitations were assessed with the Activities and Participation in Psychological Disorders according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health scale (Mini-ICF-APP). Qualitative reports of patients were used to validate the Mini-ICF-APP ratings. Clinical diagnoses were taken from the routine patient evaluation.Results: Severe capacity limitations, which are in need of support by others, could be observed especially for endurance (NM: 73.7% vs. N: 59.8% of patients), flexibility (NM: 43.0% vs. N: 22.4%), professional competency (NM: 36.0% vs. N: 16.8%), structuring of tasks (NM: 32.5% vs. N: 15.0%). Least frequent were impairment in dyadic relationships (NM: 23.7% vs. N: 7.9%). The rank order and the qualitative descriptions of impairments were similar in both groups.Conclusion: Patients with neurological disorders in general show a relevant degree of capacity limitations.

Caught in the Web: A Review of Web-Based Suicide Prevention,Good,"Lai, MH; Maniam, T; Chan, LF; Ravindran, AV",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2014,"Background: Suicide is a serious and increasing problem worldwide. The emergence of the digital world has had a tremendous impact on people's lives, both negative and positive, including an impact on suicidal behaviors. Objective: Our aim was to perform a review of the published literature on Web-based suicide prevention strategies, focusing on their efficacy, benefits, and challenges. Methods: The EBSCOhost (Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL), OvidSP, the Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect databases were searched for literature regarding Web-based suicide prevention strategies from 1997 to 2013 according to the modified PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The selected articles were subjected to quality rating and data extraction. Results: Good quality literature was surprisingly sparse, with only 15 fulfilling criteria for inclusion in the review, and most were rated as being medium to low quality. Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) reduced suicidal ideation in the general population in two randomized controlled trial (effect sizes, d=0.04-0.45) and in a clinical audit of depressed primary care patients. Descriptive studies reported improved accessibility and reduced barriers to treatment with Internet among students. Besides automated iCBT, preventive strategies were mainly interactive (email communication, online individual or supervised group support) or information-based (website postings). The benefits and potential challenges of accessibility, anonymity, and text-based communication as key components for Web-based suicide prevention strategies were emphasized. Conclusions: There is preliminary evidence that suggests the probable benefit of Web-based strategies in suicide prevention.

Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has shown benefits for the treatment and prevention of the return of fear in specific phobias by addressing the therapeutic limitations of exposure to real images. Method: Thirty-one participants with specific phobias to small animals were included: 14 were treated with CBT + VRET (intervention group), and 17 were treated with CBT + exposure to real images (active control group). Participants' scores in anxiety and phobia levels were measured at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up, and brain activation was measured through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) baseline and post-treatment. Results: Both groups showed a significant decrease in anxiety and phobia scores after the therapy and were maintained until follow-up. There were no significant differences between both groups. Overall, fMRI tests showed a significant decrease in brain activity after treatment in some structures (e.g., prefrontal and frontal cortex) and other structures (e.g., precuneus) showed an increasing activity after therapy. However, structures such as the amygdala remained active in both groups. Conclusions: The efficacy of CBT + VRET was observed in the significant decrease in anxiety responses.

As secondary objectives, the effects of the intervention on dietary habits, body composition, quality of life, level of functionality and cognitive performance were assessed. Methods This study employed a randomized clinical trial of two-parallel groups design - control group (CG) and intervention group (IG). The study was conducted in 3 Spanish health-centres between October 2018-February 2020. Eligible participants were people of both sexes and aged between 65-80 years attending the health-centres with a score >= 24 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination. Key variables included physical activity, dietary pattern, body composition, cognitive performance, level of functionality and quality of life. All variables were measured at baseline and after 3-months. Both groups received a brief nutritional and physical activity advice. Intervention group participants were instructed to use a smartphone application for a period of 3-months. This application integrates information on physical activity received from a fitness bracelet and self-reported information on the patient's daily nutritional composition. Results The study population comprised 160 participants (IG = 81, CG = 79), with a mean age of 70.8 +/- 4.0 years (61.3% women). No difference was found in the primary and secondary outcomes analyzed (physical activity (steps/min -0.4 (-1.0 to 0.2) p = 0.174), and dietary habits (Mediterranean diet score 0.0 (-0.6 to 0.6) p = 0.956) that could be attributed to either group after an ANCOVA test. A difference attributable to the intervention was observed in the total Clock test score (0.7 (0.1 to 1.2) p = 0.018. Conclusions In a sample of people over 65 years of age, the combined use of the EVIDENT 3 smartphone app and an activity tracking bracelet for 3-months did not result in lifestyles changes related to the amount and level of physical activity or the eating habits, compared to brief lifestyle advice.

Changing practice: assessing attitudes toward a NICE-informed collaborative treatment pathway for bipolar disorder,Not Multi User,"Elliott, AL; Watson, S; Dodgson, G; Cohen-Tovée, E; Ling, JN",BJPSYCH OPEN,2021,"Background Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental health condition, which can result in functional impairment despite medication. A large evidence base supports use of psychological therapies and structured care in the treatment of mood disorders, but these are rarely implemented. e-Pathways are digital structures that inform and record patient progress through a healthcare system, although these have not yet been used for bipolar disorder. Aims To assess the perceived benefits and costs associated with implementing a collaborative NICE-informed e-pathway for bipolar disorder. Method Healthcare professionals and people with bipolar disorder attended a workshop to share feedback on e-pathways. Data were collected through questionnaires (n = 26) and transcription of a focus group, analysed qualitatively by a framework analysis. Results Patients and healthcare professionals welcomed the development of an e-pathway for bipolar disorder. There were five elements to the framework: quality and delivery of care, patient-clinician collaboration, flexibility and adaptability, impact on staff and impact on healthcare services. Conclusions Identification of benefits and costs ensures that future development of e-pathways addresses concerns of healthcare professionals and people with bipolar disorder, which would be essential for successful implementation. Recommendations for this development include making e-pathways less complicated for patients, ensuring sufficient training and ensuring clinicians do not feel their skills become invalidated.

"Characteristics of the Nighttime Hospital Bedside Care Environment (Sound, Light, and Temperature) for Children With Cancer",Not mental health,"Linder, LA; Christian, BJ",CANCER NURSING,2011,"Background: Children with cancer must cope not only with their disease and its treatment but also with the environment in which treatment is given. The intensities of sound and light levels required to perform necessary patient care may result in a disruptive nighttime care environment. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe nighttime patterns of environmental factors, sound, light, and temperature levels, at the bedside of children with cancer receiving inpatient chemotherapy. Methods: Participants were 15 school-aged children receiving chemotherapy on an inpatient pediatric oncology unit. Sound, light, and temperature in the child's room were measured continuously using a digital-sound pressure-level meter and an external channel data logger. Results: Mean nighttime sound levels were 49.5 (SD, 3.1) dB (range, 34.6-84.8 dB). Sound and light intensities were greatest early in the shift and decreased through the night. A basic mixed linear model identified significant main effects of time of night for both sound (F = 50.42, P < .01) and light (F = 12.43, P < .01). Conclusions: Study findings identified a bedside care environment with persistently elevated sound levels and abrupt increases in sound intensity throughout the night. Such a disruptive nighttime environment is not conducive to restful nighttime sleep and may serve as an additional source of physiological and psychological stress for hospitalized children with cancer. Implications for Practice: Efforts are needed to identify modifiable sources of nighttime sound and develop interventions to reduce nighttime sound. Collaborative efforts to organize clinical care to minimize nighttime disruptions may lead to reduced bedside sound levels.",10.1097/NCC.0b013e3181fc52d0,"pubmed, wos",Oncology; Nursing,Childhood cancer; Hospital environment; Light levels; Noise; Sound levels,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1097/NCC.0b013e3181fc52d0)
ChatGPT is not ready yet for use in providing mental health assessment and interventions,Not Multi User,"Dergaa, I; Fekih-Romdhane, F; Hallit, S; Loch, AA; Glenn, JM; Fessi, MS; Ben Aissa, M; Souissi, N; Guelmami, N; Swed, S; El Omri, A; Bragazzi, NL; Ben Saad, H",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2024,"Background: Psychiatry is a specialized field of medicine that focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental health disorders. With advancements in technology and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there has been a growing interest in exploring the potential of AI language models systems, such as Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT), to assist in the field of psychiatry. Objective: Our study aimed to evaluates the effectiveness, reliability and safeness of ChatGPT in assisting patients with mental health problems, and to assess its potential as a collaborative tool for mental health professionals through a simulated interaction with three distinct imaginary patients. Methods: Three imaginary patient scenarios (cases A, B, and C) were created, representing different mental health problems. All three patients present with, and seek to eliminate, the same chief complaint (i.e., difficulty falling asleep and waking up frequently during the night in the last 2 degrees weeks). ChatGPT was engaged as a virtual psychiatric assistant to provide responses and treatment recommendations. Results: In case A, the recommendations were relatively appropriate (albeit non-specific), and could potentially be beneficial for both users and clinicians. However, as complexity of clinical cases increased (cases B and C), the information and recommendations generated by ChatGPT became inappropriate, even dangerous; and the limitations of the program became more glaring. The main strengths of ChatGPT lie in its ability to provide quick responses to user queries and to simulate empathy. One notable limitation is ChatGPT inability to interact with users to collect further information relevant to the diagnosis and management of a patient's clinical condition. Another serious limitation is ChatGPT inability to use critical thinking and clinical judgment to drive patient's management. Conclusion: As for July 2023, ChatGPT failed to give the simple medical advice given certain clinical scenarios. This supports that the quality of ChatGPT-generated content is still far from being a guide for users and professionals to provide accurate mental health information. It remains, therefore, premature to conclude on the usefulness and safety of ChatGPT in mental health practice.",10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1277756,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,anxiety; chatbots; depression; insomnia; language models; mental health; patient care; psychiatric disorders,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1277756)
Chatbot-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Adolescents With Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Feasibility and Acceptability Study,Not Multi User,"Nicol, G; Wang, RY; Graham, S; Dodd, S; Garbutt, J",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm have escalated among adolescents to crisis levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, primary care providers (PCPs) are often called on to provide first-line care for these youth. Digital health interventions can extend mental health specialty care, but few are evidence based. We evaluated the feasibility of delivering an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) app with an embedded conversational agent to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to symptomatic adolescents presenting in primary care settings during the pandemic. Objective: In this 12-week pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of delivering the app-based intervention to adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with moderate depressive symptoms who were treated in a practice-based research network (PBRN) of academically affiliated primary care clinics. We also obtained preliminary estimates of app acceptability, effectiveness, and usability. Methods: This small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated depressive symptom severity in adolescents randomized to the app or to a wait list control condition. The primary end point was depression severity at 4-weeks, measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data on acceptability, feasibility, and usability were collected from adolescents and their parent or legal guardian. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PCPs from 11 PBRN clinics to identify facilitators and barriers to incorporating mental health apps in treatment planning for adolescents with depression and anxiety. Results: The pilot randomized 18 participants to the app (n=10, 56%) or to a wait list control condition (n=8, 44%); 17 participants were included in the analysis, and 1 became ineligible upon chart review due to lack of eligibility based on documented diagnosis. The overall sample was predominantly female (15/17, 88%), White (15/17, 88%), and privately insured (15/17, 88%). Mean PHQ-9 scores at 4 weeks decreased by 3.3 points in the active treatment group (representing a shift in mean depression score from moderate to mild symptom severity categories) and 2 points in the wait list control group (no shift in symptom severity category). Teen- and parent-reported usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the app was high. PCPs reported preference for introducing mHealth interventions like the one in this study early in the course of care for individuals presenting with mild or moderate symptoms. Conclusions: In this small study, we demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of using a CBT-based chatbot for adolescents presenting with moderate depressive symptoms in a network of PBRN-based primary care clinics. This pilot study could not establish effectiveness, but our results suggest that further study in a larger pediatric population is warranted.

Objective: This study aimed to measure the ability of patients and members of their social network to complete checklists for complications of systemic treatment for cancer and examine the impact on patient-centered and health-economic outcomes. Methods: A prospective interventional cohort study was performed to assess the impact of a smartphone app used by patients undergoing systemic cancer therapy and members of their network to monitor for common complications. The app was used by patients, a nominated safety buddy, and acute oncology services. The control group was made up of patients from the same institution. Measures were based on process (completion of checklists over 60 days), patient experience outcomes (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the General version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy at baseline, 1 month, and 2 months) and health-economic outcomes (usage of appointments in primary care and elective and unscheduled hospital admissions). Results: At the conclusion of the study, 50 patients had completed 2882 checklists, and their 50 safety buddies had completed 318 checklists. Near daily usage was maintained over the 60-day study period. When compared to a cohort of 50 patients with matching disease profiles from the same institution, patients in the intervention group had comparable changes in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and General version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy. Patients in the Intervention Group required a third (32 vs 97 nights) of the hospital days with overnight stay compared to patients in the Control Group, though the difference was not significant. The question, I feel safer with the checklist, received a mean score of 4.27 (SD 0.87) on a Likert scale (1-5) for patients and 4.55 (SD 0.65) for family and friends.

Methods: A case control design with qualitative content analysis of semi-structured interviews and statistical analysis of anxiety ratings were used for evaluating a strategy for psychological preparation and distraction. Fifty-seven children aged 2 to 18 years and their parents participated - 30 children in the baseline group and 27 in the intervention group. Child interviews were performed and the child and their parents rated the child's anxiety. Results: The intervention was most appropriate for the younger children, who enjoyed the digital story, the stuffed animal and training with their parents. There were some technical problems and the digital story was not detailed enough to fit exactly with various cancer diagnoses. Children described suggestions for improvement of the intervention. The ratings of the child's anxiety during radiation treatment showed no differences between the baseline group and the intervention group. Conclusions: The children of all the age groups experienced their interventions as positive.

Clinical EFT as an evidence-based practice for the treatment of psychological and physiological conditions: A systematic review,Not Digital,"Church, D; Stapleton, P; Vasudevan, A; O'Keefe, T",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2022,"Background: Since the turn of the century, Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) has come into widespread use in medical and psychological treatment settings. It is also used as self-help by tens of millions of people each year. Clinical EFT, the manualized form of the method, has been validated as an evidence-based  practice using criteria published by the American Psychological Association (APA) Division 12 Task Force on Empirically Validated Therapies. Its three essential ingredients are exposure, cognitive framing, and acupressure. Objectives: In 2013 we published a paper defining Clinical EFT and reviewing published research. It has been viewed or downloaded over 36,000 times, indicating widespread interest in this treatment modality. Here we update our findings based on subsequently published literature and propose directions for future research. Method: We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses. Retrieval of 4,167 results resulted in the identification of 56 RCTs (n = 2,013), 41 of which were published subsequent to our earlier review, as well as eight meta-analyses. Results: RCTs have found EFT treatment to be effective for (a) psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (b) physiological issues such as pain, insomnia, and autoimmune conditions; (c) professional and sports performance; and (d) biological markers of stress. Meta-analyses evaluating the effect of EFT treatment have found it to be moderate  to large.  Successful independent replication studies have been carried out for anxiety, depression, PTSD, phobias, sports performance, and cortisol levels. We outline the next steps in EFT research. These include determining its impact on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment; analysis of the large-scale datasets made possible by mobile apps; and delivery through channels such as virtual practitioner sessions, artificial intelligence agents, online courses, apps, virtual reality platforms, and standardized group therapy. Conclusions: Subsequent research has confirmed the conclusions of earlier studies. These find Clinical EFT to be efficacious for a range of psychological and physiological conditions. Comparatively few treatment sessions are required, treatment is effective whether delivered in person or virtually, and symptom improvements persist over time. Treatment is associated with measurable biological effects in the dimensions of gene expression, brain synchrony, hormonal synthesis, and a wide range of biomarkers. Clinical EFT is a stable and mature method with an extensive evidence base. Its use in primary care settings as a safe, rapid, reliable, and effective treatment for both psychological and medical diagnoses continues to grow.",10.3389/fpsyg.2022.951451,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,emotional freedom techniques (EFT); anxiety; depression; PTSD; somatic symptoms; pain; insomnia; obesity,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.951451)
Clinical and cost-effectiveness of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy for depression in primary care: Design of a randomised trial,Not Multi User,"de Graaf, LE; Gerhards, SAH; Evers, SMAA; Arntz, A; Riper, H; Severens, JL; Widdershoven, G; Metsemakers, JFM; Huibers, MJH",BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,2008,"Background: Major depression is a common mental health problem in the general population, associated with a substantial impact on quality of life and societal costs. However, many depressed patients in primary care do not receive the care they need. Reason for this is that pharmacotherapy is only effective in severely depressed patients and psychological treatments in primary care are scarce and costly. A more feasible treatment in primary care might be computerised cognitive behavioural therapy. This can be a self- help computer program based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy. Although previous studies suggest that computerised cognitive behavioural therapy is effective, more research is necessary. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to evaluate the (cost-) effectiveness of online computerised cognitive behavioural therapy for depression in primary care. Methods/ Design: In a randomised trial we will compare (a) computerised cognitive behavioural therapy with (b) treatment as usual by a GP, and (c) computerised cognitive behavioural therapy in combination with usual GP care. Three hundred mild to moderately depressed patients (aged 18 - 65) will be recruited in the general population by means of a large- scale Internet- based screening (N = 200,000). Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the three treatment groups. Primary outcome measure of the clinical evaluation is the severity of depression. Other outcomes include psychological distress, social functioning, and dysfunctional beliefs. The economic evaluation will be performed from a societal perspective, in which all costs will be related to clinical effectiveness and health-related quality of life. All outcome assessments will take place on the Internet at baseline, two, three, six, nine, and twelve months. Costs are measured on a monthly basis. A time horizon of one year will be used without long-term extrapolation of either costs or quality of life. Discussion: Although computerised cognitive behavioural therapy is a promising treatment for depression in primary care, more research is needed. The effectiveness of online computerised cognitive behavioural therapy without support remains to be evaluated as well as the effects of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy in combination with usual GP care. Economic evaluation is also needed. Methodological strengths and weaknesses are discussed.

Methods This observational study of digital MSK program participants versus nonparticipants (n = 2570) examined pain, function, depression, and anxiety at 3, 6, and 12 months, and health care use at 12 months. The intervention group engaged in a digital MSK program that included exercise, education, and coaching for at least 3 months. The nonparticipant group registered, but never started the program. We collected data in app or by emailed survey at 3, 6, and 12 months after registering for the program. We conducted descriptive analyses and unadjusted and adjusted regression modeling. Results The odds ratio of achieving a minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in pain improvement for the intervention versus the nonparticipant group was 1.97 (95% CI: 1.28, 3.02; p = .002) at 3 months, 1.44 (95% CI: 0.91, 2.25; p = .11) at 6 months, and 2.06 (95% CI: 1.38, 3.08; p = .004) at 12 months in adjusted models. The odds ratio of achieving a MCID in functional improvement for the intervention versus the nonparticipant group was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.38; p = .01) at 3 months, 1.55 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.37; p = .04) at 6 months, and 1.35 (95% CI: 0.89, 2.06, p = 0.16) at 12 months in adjusted models. For those with moderate to severe depression or anxiety at baseline, we observed statistically significant lower odds of moderate to severe depression or anxiety at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months for the intervention versus the nonparticipant group in adjusted models (p < .05). At 12 months, the percentage with invasive, imaging, and conservative services was higher for the nonparticipant versus intervention group by 5.7, 8.1, and 16.7 percentage points, respectively (p < 0.05).

Clinician Perspectives and Design Implications in Using Patient-Generated Health Data to Improve Mental Health Practices: Mixed Methods Study,Population,"Wu, DTY; Xin, C; Bindhu, S; Xu, C; Sachdeva, J; Brown, JL; Jung, H",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2020,"Background: Patient-generated health data (PGHD) have been largely collected through mobile health (mHealth) apps and wearable devices. PGHD can be especially helpful in mental health, as patients' illness history and symptom narratives are vital to developing diagnoses and treatment plans. However, the extent to which clinicians use mental health-related PGHD is unknown. Objective: A mixed methods study was conducted to understand clinicians' perspectives on PGHD and current mental health apps. This approach uses information gathered from semistructured interviews, workflow analysis, and user-written mental health app reviews to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the current workflow of mental health practice and how are PGHD integrated into this workflow, (2) what are clinicians' perspectives on PGHD and how do they choose mobile apps for their patients, (3) and what are the features of current mobile apps in terms of interpreting and sharing PGHD? Methods: The study consists of semistructured interviews with 12 psychiatrists and clinical psychologists from a large academic hospital. These interviews were thematically and qualitatively analyzed for common themes and workflow elements. User-posted reviews of 56 sleep and mood tracking apps were analyzed to understand app features in comparison with the information gathered from interviews. Results: The results showed that PGHD have been part of the workflow, but its integration and use are not optimized. Mental health clinicians supported the use of PGHD but had concerns regarding data reliability and accuracy. They also identified challenges in selecting suitable apps for their patients. From the app review, it was discovered that mHealth apps had limited features to support personalization and collaborative care as well as data interpretation and sharing. Conclusions: This study investigates clinicians' perspectives on PGHD use and explored existing app features using the app review data in the mental health setting. A total of 3 design guidelines were generated: (1) improve data interpretation and sharing mechanisms, (2) consider clinical workflow and electronic health record integration, and (3) support personalized and collaborative care.

Closing the Virtual Gap in Health Care: A Series of Case Studies Illustrating the Impact of Embedding Evaluation Alongside System Initiatives,Other,"Desveaux, L; Budhwani, S; Stamenova, V; Bhattacharyya, O; Shaw, J; Bhatia, RS",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2021,"Early decisions relating to the implementation of virtual care relied on necessity and clinical judgement, but there is a growing need for the generation of evidence to inform policy and practice designs. The need for stronger partnerships between researchers and decision-makers is well recognized, but how these partnerships can be structured and how research can be embedded alongside existing virtual care initiatives remain unclear. We present a series of case studies that illustrate how embedded research can inform policy decisions related to the implementation of virtual care, where decisions are either to (1) discontinue (red light), (2) redesign (yellow light), or (3) scale up existing initiatives (green light). Data were collected through document review and informal interviews with key study personnel. Case 1 involved an evaluation of a mobile diabetes platform that demonstrated a mismatch between the setting and the technology (decision outcome: discontinue). Case 2 involved an evaluation of a mental health support platform that suggested evidence-based modifications to the delivery model (decision outcome: redesign). Case 3 involved an evaluation of video visits that generated evidence to inform the ideal model of implementation at scale (decision outcome: scale up). In this paper, we highlight the characteristics of the partnership and the process that enabled success and use the cases to illustrate how these characteristics were operationalized. Structured communication included monthly check-ins and iterative report development. We also outline key characteristics of the partnership (ie, trust and shared purpose) and the process (ie, timeliness, tailored reporting, and adaptability) that drove the uptake of evidence in decision-making. Across each case, the evaluation was designed to address policy questions articulated by our partners. Furthermore, structured communication provided opportunities for knowledge mobilization. Structured communication was operationalized through monthly meetings as well as the delivery of interim and final reports. These case studies demonstrate the importance of partnering with health system decision-makers to generate and mobilize scientific evidence. Embedded research partnerships founded on a shared purpose of system service provided an effective strategy to bridge the oft-cited gap between science and policy.

Co-design of digital health interventions with young people: A scoping review,Other,"Malloy, J; Partridge, SR; Kemper, JA; Braakhuis, A; Roy, R",DIGITAL HEALTH,2023,"IntroductionInnovative health promotion strategies are crucial for enhancing global quality of life and curbing premature deaths. Digital health promotion is particularly impactful for young individuals often using internet-connected devices. Collaborative methodologies in digital intervention research offer insights into supporting youth during key life stages, such as adolescence. This review sought to examine the literature on digital health interventions for youth co-designed via participatory frameworks.MethodsFollowing the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual and an adapted Arksey & O'Malley's 6-stage framework, this review utilised the PRISMA-ScR checklist for structured reporting. Peer-reviewed research where young individuals (15-35 years) contributed to digital health intervention design was analysed. Systematic synthesis adhered to Braun & Clarke's Thematic Analysis Guidelines, mapping data to research queries and thematic framework.ResultsEighteen articles were systematically synthesised, revealing seven main themes: digital tool, inquiry field, report aim, participatory activities, intervention attributes and behavioural change support. Seventeen distinctive digital health interventions were assessed, mostly within risk mitigation and mental health domains. Predominantly, interventions were web-based, with mental wellness websites emerging as the prevalent tool. User experience testing stood out as the primary reported outcome.ConclusionSeveral innovative digital health interventions targeting youth have been identified. Platforms including social media, specialised apps, websites and video games are instrumental for health advice and clinical support dissemination, overcoming access and cost barriers. Participatory techniques are integral for the efficacy of digital health resources, encompassing youth aspirations and anticipations.

Using experience-based co-design methods, we sought consensus from key stakeholders on the most important actionable processes of care for inclusion in a quality improvement checklist. Methods: Item generation methods: systematic review, semi-structured interviews (ICU survivors and family) members, touchpoint video creation, and semi-structured interviews (ICU clinicians). Consensus methods: modified online Delphi and a virtual meeting using nominal group technique methods. Results: We enrolled 138 ICU interprofessional team, patients, and family members. We obtained consensus on a quality improvement checklist comprising 11 core domains: patient and family involvement in decision-making; patient communication; physical comfort and complication prevention; promoting self-care and normalcy; ventilator weaning; physical therapy; swallowing; pharmacotherapy; psychological issues; delirium; and appro-priate referrals. An additional 27 actionable processes are contained within 6 core domains that provide more specific direction on the actionable process to be targeted.

Co-treatment of buspirone with atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs) improved neurocognitive function in chronic schizophrenia,Other,"Wang, Y; Yang, X; Song, XL; Zhao, LS; Wei, JX; Wang, JX; Tian, H; Zheng, CY; Wei, M; Wang, Q; Guo, WJ; Deng, W; Li, T; Ma, XH",SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH,2019,"We conducted a 24-week, randomized, double-blind parallel-controlled trial to test whether buspirone is beneficial to improve cognitive deficits of schizophrenia because it remains unclear. Two hundred patients received in random order either co-treatment buspirone with AAPDs or monotherapy with AAPDs. All patients had been treated with a stable dosage of AAPDs for at least three months. The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24), and 14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA-14) were used to evaluate clinical symptoms. The short version of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised in China (WAIS-RC) was used to assess neurocognitive function. Social function and family burden were evaluated by Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS) and Family Burden Interview Schedule (FBIS). All patients were enrolled at baseline and followed up after 12 and 24 weeks. A total of 196 patients completed the trial, with 99 in the combined treatment group and 97 in the control group. During the intervention, the score of PANSS, HAMD-24, and HAMA-14 decreased slightly without group differences. Repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences between the two groups in the score of arithmetic, similarities, picture completion, block design, SDSS, and FBIS (P > 0.05), but no difference was found with regard to the score of information, digital span test, or digital symbols (P > 0.05). In conclusion, co-treatment with buspirone and APPDs outperformed APPDs alone in improving cognitive deficit and reducing family burden of schizophrenia.

Coach-Facilitated Web-Based Therapy Compared With Information About Web-Based Resources in Patients Referred to Secondary Mental Health Care for Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"MacLean, S; Corsi, DJ; Litchfield, S; Kucharski, J; Genise, K; Selaman, Z; Testa, V; Hatcher, S",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2020,"Background: Depression is a common mental disorder with a high social burden and significant impact on suicidality and quality of life. Treatment is often limited to drug therapies because of long waiting times to see psychological therapists face to face, despite several guidelines recommending that psychological treatments should be first-line interventions for mild to moderate depression. Objective: We aimed to evaluate, among patients on a waitlist to receive secondary mental health care services for depression, how effective coach-guided web-based therapy (The Journal) is, compared with an information-only waitlist control group, in reducing depression symptoms after 12 weeks. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel arms and a process evaluation, which included interviews with study participants. Participants assigned to the intervention group received 12 weeks of web-based therapy guided by a coach who had a background in social work. Patients in the control group receive a leaflet of mental health resources they could access. The primary outcome measure was a change in depression scores, as measured by the Patient-Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Results: A total of 95 participants were enrolled (intervention, n=47; control, n=48). The mean change in PHQ-9 scores from baseline to week 12 was -3.6 (SD 6.6) in the intervention group and -3.1 (SD 6.2) in the control group, which was not a statistically significant difference with a two-sided alpha of .05 (t(91)=-0.37; P=.72, 95% CI -3.1 to 2.2). At 12 weeks, participants in the intervention group reported higher health-related quality of life (mean EuroQol 5 dimensions visual analogue scale [EQ-5D-VAS] score 66.8, SD 18.0) compared with the control group (mean EQ-5D VAS score 55.9, SD 19.2; t(84)=-2.73; P=.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in health service use following their initial consultation with a psychiatrist. The process evaluation showed that participants in the intervention group completed a mean of 5.0 (SD 2.3) lessons in The Journal and 8.8 (SD 3.1) sessions with the coach. Most participants (29/47, 62%) in the intervention group who completed the full dose of the intervention, by finishing 6 or more lessons in The Journal, were more likely to have a clinically important reduction in depressive symptoms at 12 weeks compared with the control group (Chi(2)(1)=6.3; P=.01, Phi=0.37). Participants who completed the interviews reported that the role played by the coach was a major factor in adherence to the study intervention. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the use of guided web-based therapy for the treatment of depression is not more effective than information-only waitlist control. However, it showed that the coach has the potential to increase adherence and engagement with web-based depression treatment protocols.

Primary care is the de facto site for treating these mental health problems but is typically underresourced to meet the burden of these demands. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of a mobile intervention platform, IntelliCare, for addressing depression and anxiety among primary care patients. Design, Setting, and Participants Two-arm randomized clinical trial at internal medicine clinics at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Adult primary care patients (N = 146) who screened positive for depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ; score >= 10) or anxiety on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; score >= 8) were recruited between July 17, 2018, and December 14, 2018. Interventions The coach-supported platform composed of a suite of apps, was delivered over 8 weeks. Wait list control participants received treatment as usual for 8 weeks, then the mobile platform. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were changes in depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) during the intervention period. Secondary outcomes were differences in the proportion of patients who achieved recovery (PHQ-9/GAD-7 <5 or 50% improvement from baseline), sustainment of intervention effects during 2-month follow-up, and app use during the intervention period. Results One hundred forty-six patients were included (119 of 146 were women [81.5%]; mean [SD] age, 42.3 [13.8] years). Of the 146 patients, 122 (83.6%) were diagnosed as having depression and 131 (89.7%) were diagnosed as having anxiety. A greater proportion of intervention vs wait list control participants achieved recovery from depression (n = 38 of 64 [59%] vs n = 18 of 58 [31%]; odds ratio, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.54-6.86) and anxiety (n = 37 of 65 [57%] vs n = 25 of 66 [38%]; odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.08-4.36). Sustained effects were observed for depression (slope, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.10; P = .92) and anxiety scores (slope, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.12; P = .67) during follow-up. App use was high, with a median of 93 and 98 sessions among participants with depression and anxiety, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance In this trial, a mobile intervention app was effective for depression and anxiety among primary care patients.

We report findings from a clinical trial that examined the effectiveness of Cogmed, a computerized program that trains WM. We compare this program to a Sham condition in older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Methods: Older adults (N = 68) living in the community were assessed. Participants reported memory impairment and met criteria for MCI, either by poor delayed memory or poor performance in other cognitive areas. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS, Delayed Memory Index) and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) were utilized. All presented with normal Mini Mental State Exams (MMSE) and activities of daily living (ADLs). Participants were randomized to Cogmed or a Sham computer program. Twenty-five sessions were completed over five to seven weeks. Pre, post, and follow-up measures included a battery of cognitive measures (three WM tests), a subjective memory scale, and a functional measure.Results: Both intervention groups improved over time. Cogmed significantly outperformed Sham on Span Board and exceeded in subjective memory reports at follow-up as assessed by the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). The Cogmed group demonstrated better performance on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), a measure of adjustment and far transfer, at follow-up. Both groups, especially Cogmed, enjoyed the intervention.Conclusions: Results suggest that WM was enhanced in both groups of older adults with MCI.

Objective: The aim of this paper is to perform a systematic review of controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy of cognitive and/or behavioral techniques on the treatment of SAD. Method: A systematic analysis of randomized clinical trials indexed in the following databases was made: PubMed/MedLine, PsycINFO, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, LILACS, ISI Web of Science, and related articles. Results: No consensus on the efficacy of associating cognitive and behavioral therapies was found. Novel techniques ( such as virtual reality, by-computer homework, and self therapy with therapeutic assistance) were found to be as effective as standard cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The association of CBT with the avoidance of safety behaviors, as well as with social skills training was associated with an additional advantage. As for behavioral therapy, focus training and exposure therapy were considered to be the most effective techniques.

Cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) for post-traumatic stress disorder: study protocol of an app-based randomised controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Kroener, J; Greiner, A; Sosic-Vasic, Z",BMJ OPEN,2023,"Introduction Previous studies indicate that computerised trainings implementing cognitive bias modification (CBM) for interpretation bias might be promising treatments for trauma-related cognitive distortions and symptoms. However, results are mixed, which might be related to the implemented task (sentence completion task), setting, or training duration. Within the present study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an app-based intervention for interpretation bias using standardised imagery audio scripts, which is designed as a standalone treatment.Methods and analysis The study is a randomised controlled trial, implementing two parallel arms. 130 patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be allocated to either the intervention group or the waiting-list control group receiving treatment as usual. The intervention consists of 3 weeks of an app-based CBM training for interpretation bias using mental imagery, with three training sessions (20 min) per week. Two months after the last training session, 1 week of booster CBM treatment will be implemented, consisting of three additional training sessions. Outcome assessments will be conducted pretraining, 1 week post-training, 2 months post-training, as well as 1 week after the booster session (approximately 2.5 months after initial training termination). The primary outcome is interpretation bias. Secondary outcomes include PTSD-related cognitive distortions and symptom severity, as well as negative affectivity. Outcome assessment will be conducted by intention-to-treat analysis, as well as per-protocol analysis using linear mixed models.Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the State Chamber of Physicians in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany (number of approval: F-2022-080).

Cognitive computer training in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) versus no intervention: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Bikic, A; Leckman, JF; Lindschou, J; Christensen, TO; Dalsgaard, S",TRIALS,2015,"Background: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention and impulsivity and/or hyperactivity and a range of cognitive dysfunctions. Pharmacological treatment may be beneficial; however, many affected individuals continue to have difficulties with cognitive functions despite medical treatment, and up to 30 % do not respond to pharmacological treatment. Inadequate medical compliance and the long-term effects of treatment make it necessary to explore nonpharmacological and supplementary treatments for ADHD. Treatment of cognitive dysfunctions may prove particularly important because of the impact of these dysfunctions on the ability to cope with everyday life. Lately, several trials have shown promising results for cognitive computer training, often referred to as cognitive training, which focuses on particular parts of cognition, mostly on the working memory or attention but with poor generalization of training on other cognitive functions and functional outcome. Children with ADHD have a variety of cognitive dysfunctions, and it is important that cognitive training target multiple cognitive functions. Methods/Design: This multicenter randomized clinical superiority trial aims to investigate the effect of ACTIVATE (TM), a computer program designed to improve a range of cognitive skills and ADHD symptoms. A total of 122 children with ADHD, aged 6 to 13 years, will be randomized to an intervention or a control group. The intervention group will be asked to use ACTIVATE (TM) at home 40 minutes per day, 6 days per week for 8 weeks. Both intervention and control group will receive treatment as usual. Outcome measures will assess cognitive functions, symptoms, and behavioral and functional measures before and after the 8 weeks of training and in a 12- and 24-week follow-up. Discussion: Results of this trial will provide useful information on the effectiveness of computer training focusing on several cognitive functions. Cognitive training has the potential to reduce cognitive dysfunctions and to become a new treatment option, which can promote a more normal neural development in young children with ADHD and thus reduce cognitive dysfunctions and symptoms. This could help children with ADHD to perform better in everyday life and school.",10.1186/s13063-015-0975-8,wos,Research & Experimental Medicine,ADHD; Cognitive training; Cognitive remediation; Cognition; Computer training; Nonpharmacological treatment,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-015-0975-8)
Cognitive training with fully immersive virtual reality in patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials,Not Multi User,"Jahn, FS; Skovbye, M; Obenhausen, K; Jespersen, AE; Miskowiak, KW",PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH,2021,"Cognitive impairment occurs across several neuropsychiatric diseases and impede everyday functioning and quality of life. Fully immersive Virtual Reality (VR) aid motivation and engagement and therefore has a potential to help overcome the obstacles in the field of cognitive rehabilitation. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate whether VR can be a useful intervention in cognitive rehabilitation transdiagnostically. We identified nine studies with randomized controlled trials following the PRISMA guidelines in databases Pubmed, Embase and PsychInfo. The trials were all evaluated through Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias. The studies were conducted in patients with mild cognitive impairment (k=4), schizophrenia (k=3), ADHD (k=1), or stroke (k=1) and involved 6-12 weeks of training. Overall, results showed improvement in some domains of cognition, primarily executive function and attention. The studies were pilot studies with 6-34 participants per treatment group. Risk of bias was either high (k=3) or moderate (some concerns) (k=6). Key reasons were suboptimal statistical analyses and lack of clarification on randomization and blinding of participants and assessors. In conclusion, this review found promising evidence for VR cognitive rehabilitation for neuropsychiatric illnesses.

However, more recent research has shown that positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations are on a continuum with normality and therefore might also be susceptible to adaptations of the cognitive behavioral therapies found useful for anxiety and depression. In the context of a model of cognitive, emotional, and social processes in psychosis, the latest evidence for the putative psychological mechanisms that elicit and maintain symptoms is reviewed. There is now good support for emotional processes in psychosis, for the role of cognitive processes including reasoning biases, for the central role of appraisal, and for the effects of the social environment, including stress and trauma. We have also used virtual environments to test our hypotheses. These developments have improved our understanding of symptom dimensions such as distress and conviction and also provide a rationale for interventions, which have some evidence of efficacy. Therapeutic approaches are described as follows: a collaborative therapeutic relationship, managing dysphoria, helping service users reappraise their beliefs to reduce distress, working on negative schemas, managing and reducing stressful environments if possible, compensating for reasoning biases by using disconfirmation strategies, and considering the full range of evidence in order to reduce high conviction.

Combined diet and exercise interventions for preventing gestational diabetes mellitus,Not Digital,"Shepherd, E; Gomersall, JC; Tieu, J; Han, S; Crowther, CA; Middleton, P",COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,2017,"Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with a wide range of adverse health consequences for women and their infants in the short and long term. With an increasing prevalence of GDM worldwide, there is an urgent need to assess strategies for GDM prevention, such as combined diet and exercise interventions. This is an update of a Cochrane review that was first published in 2015. Objectives To assess the effects of diet interventions in combination with exercise interventions for pregnant women for preventing GDM, and associated adverse health consequences for the mother and her infant/child. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (27 November 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs, comparing combined diet and exercise interventions with no intervention (i.e. standard care), that reported on GDM diagnosis as an outcome. Quasi-RCTs were excluded. Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. We planned to include RCTs comparing two or more different diet/exercise interventions, however none were identified. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of the included trials and assessed quality of evidence for selected maternal and infant/child outcomes using the GRADE approach. We checked data for accuracy. Main results In this update, we included 23 RCTs (involving 8918 women and 8709 infants) that compared combined diet and exercise interventions with no intervention (standard care). The studies varied in the diet and exercise programs evaluated and health outcomes reported. None reported receiving funding from a drug manufacturer or agency with interests in the results. Overall risk of bias was judged to be unclear due to the lack of methodological detail reported. Most studies were undertaken in high-income countries. For our primary review outcomes, there was a possible reduced risk of GDM in the diet and exercise intervention group compared with the standard care group (average risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.01; 6633 women; 19 RCTs; Tau(2) = 0.05; I-2 = 42%; P = 0.07; moderate-quality evidence). There was also a possible reduced risk of caesarean section (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.02; 6089 women; 14 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence). No clear differences were seen between groups for pre-eclampsia (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.22; 5366 participants; 8 RCTs; low-quality evidence), pregnancy-induced hypertension and/or hypertension (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.27; 3073 participants; 6 RCTs; Tau(2) = 0.19; I-2 = 62%; very low-quality evidence), perinatal mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.63; 3757 participants; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) or large-for-gestational age (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; 5353 participants; 11 RCTs; low-quality evidence). No data were reported for infant mortality or morbidity composite. Subgroup analyses (based on trial design, maternal body mass index (BMI) and ethnicity) revealed no clear differential treatment effects. We were unable to assess the impact of maternal age, parity and specific features of the diet and exercise interventions. Findings from sensitivity analyses (based on RCT quality) generally supported those observed in the main analyses. We were not able to perform subgroup analyses based on maternal age, parity or nature of the exercise/dietary interventions due to the paucity of information/data on these characteristics and the inability to meaningfully group intervention characteristics. For most of the secondary review outcomes assessed using GRADE, there were no clear differences between groups, including for perineal trauma (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.05; 2733 participants; 2 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence), neonatal hypoglycaemia (average RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.98; 3653 participants; 2 RCTs; Tau(2) = 0.23; I-2 = 77%; low quality evidence); and childhood adiposity (BMI z score) (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.40; 794 participants; 2 RCTs; Tau(2) = 0.04; I-2 = 59%; low-quality evidence). However, there was evidence of less gestational weight gain in the diet and exercise intervention group compared with the control group (mean difference (MD) -0.89 kg, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.40; 5052 women; 16 RCTs; Tau(2) = 0.37; I-2 = 43%; moderate-quality evidence). No data were reported for maternal postnatal depression or type 2 diabetes; childhood/adulthood type 2 diabetes, or neurosensory disability. Authors' conclusions Moderate-quality evidence suggests reduced risks of GDM and caesarean section with combined diet and exercise interventions during pregnancy as well as reductions in gestational weight gain, compared with standard care. There were no clear differences in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, perinatal mortality, large-for-gestational age, perineal trauma, neonatal hypoglycaemia, and childhood adiposity (moderate-tovery low-quality evidence). Using GRADE methodology, the evidence was assessed as moderate to very low quality. Downgrading decisions were predominantly due to design limitations (risk of bias), and imprecision (uncertain effect estimates, and at times, small sample sizes and low event rates), however two outcomes (pregnancy-induced hypertension/hypertension and neonatal hypoglycaemia), were also downgraded for unexplained inconsistency (statistical heterogeneity). Due to the variability of the diet and exercise components tested in the included studies, the evidence in this review has limited ability to inform practice. Future studies could describe the interventions used in more detail, if and how these influenced behaviour change and ideally be standardised between studies. Studies could also consider using existing core outcome sets to facilitate more standardised reporting.",10.1002/14651858.CD010443.pub3,wos,General & Internal Medicine,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010443.pub3)

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a combined online universal (ie, delivered to all pupils) school-based preventive intervention targeting substance use, depression, and anxiety in adolescence. Methods We did a multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial in secondary schools in Australia, with pupils in year 8 or 9 (aged 13-14 years). Participating schools were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to one of four intervention conditions: (1) Climate Schools-Substance Use, focusing on substance use only; (2) Climate Schools-Mental Health, focusing on depression and anxiety only; (3) Climate Schools-Combined, focusing on the prevention of substance use, depression, and anxiety; or (4) active control. The interventions were delivered in school classrooms in an online delivery format and used a mixture of peer cartoon storyboards and classroom activities that were focused on alcohol, cannabis, anxiety, and depression. The interventions were delivered for 2 years and primary outcomes were knowledge related to alcohol, cannabis, and mental health; alcohol use, including heavy episodic drinking; and depression and anxiety symptoms at 12, 24, and 30 months after baseline. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613000723785) and an extended follow-up is underway. Findings Between Sept 1, 2013, and Feb 28, 2014, we recruited 88 schools (12 391 pupils), of whom 71 schools and 6386 (51.5%) pupils were analysed (17 schools dropped out and 1308 pupils declined to participate). We allocated 18 schools (1739 [27.25%] pupils; 1690 [97.2%] completed at least one follow-up) to the substance use condition, 18 schools (1594 [25.0%] pupils; 1560 [97.9%] completed at least one follow-up) to the mental health condition, 16 schools (1497 [23.4%] pupils; 1443 [96.4%] completed at least one follow-up) to the combined condition, and 19 schools ( 1556 [23.4%] pupils; 1513 [97.2%] completed at least one follow-up) to the control condition. Compared with controls, the combined intervention group had increased knowledge related to alcohol and cannabis at 12, 24, and 30 months (standardised mean difference [SMD] for alcohol 0.26 [95% CI 0.14 to 0.39] and for cannabis 0.17 [0.06 to 0.28] at 30 months), increased knowledge related to mental health at 24 months (0.17 [0.08 to 0.27]), reduced growth in their odds of drinking and heavy episodic drinking at 12, 24, and 30 months (odds ratio for drinking 0.25 [95% CI 0.12 to 0.51], and for heavy episodic drinking 0 .15 [0.04 to 0 .58] at 30 months), and reduced increases in anxiety symptoms at 12 and 30 months (SMD -0.12 [95% CI -0.22 to -0.01] at 30 months). We found no difference in symptoms or probable diagnosis of depression. The combined intervention group also showed improvement in alcohol use outcomes compared with the substance use and mental health interventions and improvements in anxiety outcomes when compared with the mental health intervention only. Interpretation Combined online prevention of substance use, depression, and anxiety led to increased knowledge of alcohol, cannabis, and mental health, reduced increase in the odds of any drinking and heavy episodic drinking, and reduced symptoms of anxiety over a 30-month period. These findings provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of an online universal school-based preventive intervention targeting substance use, depression, and anxiety in adolescence.

Combining online and offline peer support groups in community mental health care settings: a qualitative study of service users' experiences,Good,"Strand, M; Eng, LS; Gammon, D",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS,2020,"Background Peer support for people with long-term mental health problems is central to recovery-oriented approaches in mental health care. Peer support has traditionally been conducted offline in face-to-face groups, while online groups on the Internet have increased rapidly. Offline and online peer support groups are shown to have differing strengths and weaknesses. However, little is known about how combining the two formats might be experienced by service users, which this paper aims to illuminate. Methods In this exploratory and descriptive study, a recovery-oriented Internet-based portal called ReConnect was used by service users in two mental health communities in Norway for 6-12 months. The portal included an online peer support group which also facilitated participation in local offline peer support groups. Both group formats were moderated by an employed service user consultant. Qualitative data about service users' experiences were collected through focus groups and individual interviews and inductively analyzed thematically. Results A total of 14 female service users 22-67 years of age with various diagnoses participated in three focus groups and 10 individual interviews. Two main themes were identified: (1) balancing anonymity and openness, and (2) enabling connectedness. These themes are further illustrated with the subthemes: (i) dilemmas of anonymity and confidentiality, (ii) towards self-disclosure and openness, (iii) new friendships, and (iv) networks in the local community. Three of the subthemes mainly describe benefits, while challenges were more implicit and cut across the subthemes. Identified challenges were related to transitions from anonymity online to revealing one's identity offline, confidentiality, and barriers related to participation in offline peer support groups. Conclusions This study suggests that online and offline peer support groups complement each other, and that combining them is mainly described as beneficial by service users. Identified benefits appeared to arise from service users' options of one format or the other, or that they could combine formats in ways that suited their individual values and comfort zones. Moderation by a trained service user consultant appeared essential for both formats and can be used systematically to address identified challenges. Combining online and offline peer support groups is a promising concept for facilitating recovery-oriented care and warrants continued research.",10.1186/s13033-020-00370-x,wos,Psychiatry,eHealth; Mental health; Recovery; e-Recovery; Peer support; Social support; Qualitative research; Participatory research,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00370-x)

However, the declining halves rule' is a reality: less than 50% of primary care attendees with common mental disorders were correctly diagnosed, of these less than 50% received adequate treatment (pharmacological or psychological) and of these less than 50% patients were adherent. Collaborative models of common mental disorders care in primary health care have demonstrated their effectiveness through clinical trials; however, its implementation in a more general and real context is difficult and its effectiveness remains unclear. Risk algorithms have been developed and validated in primary health care to predict the onset and prognosis of common mental disorders; which are useful for their treatment and prevention.There is evidence that psychological and psychoeducational interventions (and possibly those of physical exercise) are effective for the primary prevention of common mental disorders, even in primary health care; although their effects are small or moderate. These interventions have a high potential to be scalable in schools, workplace and primary health care; in addition, when they are administered through information and communication technologies (e.g. by App), in self-guided or minimally guided programs, they have demonstrated their effectiveness for the treatment and prevention of common mental disorders.

Communication and activation in pain to enhance relationships and treat pain with equity (COOPERATE): a randomized clinical trial,Not mental health,"Matthias, MS; Daggy, JK; Perkins, AJ; Adams, J; Bair, MJ; Burgess, DJ; Eliacin, J; Flores, P; Myers, LJ; Menen, T; Procento, P; Rand, KL; Salyers, MP; Shanahan, ML; Hirsh, AT",PAIN,2024,"Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text.Black patients with chronic pain participated in one-on-one coaching and experienced significant increases in patient activation and communication self-efficacy relative to the control group. Racialized disparities in chronic pain care are well-documented and persist despite national priorities focused on health equity. Similar disparities have been observed in patient activation (ie, having the knowledge, confidence, and skills to manage one's health). As such, interventions targeting patient activation represent a novel approach to addressing and reducing disparities in pain care. Communication and Activation in Pain to Enhance Relationships and Treat Pain with Equity is a randomized controlled trial of a 6-session telephone-delivered intervention to increase patient activation for Black patients with chronic pain. Two hundred fifty Black patients from a Midwestern Veterans Affairs medical center were randomized to the intervention or attention control. The primary outcome was patient activation; secondary outcomes included communication self-efficacy, pain, and psychological functioning. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 3 (primary endpoint), 6, and 9 months (sustained effects). Analyses used an intent-to-treat approach. Compared with baseline, patient activation increased 4.6 points at 3 months (versus +0.13 in control group, 95% CI: 0.48, 7.34; P = 0.03). These improvements in the intervention group were sustained, with +7 from baseline at 6 months and +5.77 at 9 months, and remained statistically significant from the control group. Communication self-efficacy increased significantly relative to the control group from baseline to 3 months.

"Community education on the health impacts of bushfires: Evaluation of an online pilot short course in Tasmania, Australia",Not mental health,"Campbell, SL; Brady, JJR; Anderson, CC; Ziou, M; Sinclair, D; Johnston, FH; Jones, PJ",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,2024,"Bushfires and smoke pose substantial risks to physical and mental health across exposed populations. Enhanced community-level knowledge and response capability may promote exposure reduction and therefore protect health, however few interventions exist to achieve this goal. We developed an online short course, 'Bushfires and Your Health', and piloted it with older adults as a vulnerable group. We evaluated course satisfaction, factors associated with course enrolment and completion, the likelihood of increased bushfire knowledge and response capability, and the likelihood of participants undertaking risk-mitigating or health-promoting actions. We (i) used a prepost-course survey in the intervention group and a control group (who did not undertake the course); (ii) gathered data from the intervention group via a post-course feedback survey; and (iii) analysed participant discussion board submissions for evidence of course-related behaviour change. Compared to the control group, course enrolment was significantly positively associated with several demographic characteristics, including being retired (OR = 1.32, 95 % CI [1.02-1.71]), living in proximity to bushland (OR = 1.58, 95 % CI[1.23-2.04]) and having an existing bushfire survival plan (OR = 1.34, 95 % CI[1.05-1.70]), and significantly inversely associated with being employed (OR = 0.76, 95 % CI[0.59-0.97]) and having poor bushfire knowledge (OR = 0.78, 95 % CI[0.61-0.99]). Compared to the control group, course completion was significantly associated with increased bushfire knowledge, while enrolment and completion were significantly associated with participants undertaking new actions, including downloading and using an air quality app, developing a bushfire survival plan and making household preparations. An online short course has potential to increase knowledge and preparedness actions when managing bushfires and bushfire smoke.",10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.104227,wos,Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,Bushfire; Wildfire; Air quality; Health; Resilience; Online education,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.104227)

On the other hand, people living with MDD have a greater risk for many physical diseases. This high level of comorbidity is associated with worse outcomes, reduced adherence to treatment, increased mortality, and greater health care utilization and costs. Comorbidity can also result in a range of clinical challenges, such as a more complicated therapeutic alliance, issues pertaining to adaptive health behaviors, drug-drug interactions and adverse events induced by medications used for physical and mental disorders. Potential explanations for the high prevalence of the above comorbidity involve shared genetic and biological pathways. These latter include inflammation, the gut microbiome, mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, and brain structure and function. Furthermore, MDD and physical diseases have in common several antecedents related to social factors (e.g., socioeconomic status), lifestyle variables (e.g., physical activity, diet, sleep), and stressful live events (e.g., childhood trauma). Pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies are effective treatments for comorbid MDD, and the introduction of lifestyle interventions as well as collaborative care models and digital technologies provide promising strategies for improving management. This paper aims to provide a detailed overview of the epidemiology of the comorbidity of MDD and specific physical diseases, including prevalence and bidirectional risk; of shared biological pathways potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD and common physical diseases; of socio-environmental factors that serve as both shared risk and protective factors; and of management of MDD and physical diseases, including prevention and treatment.

Comparing Crowdsourcing and Friendsourcing: A Social Media-Based Feasibility Study to Support Alzheimer Disease Caregivers,Good,"Bateman, DR; Brady, E; Wilkerson, D; Yi, EH; Karanam, Y; Callahan, CM",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2017,"Background: In the United States, over 15 million informal caregivers provide unpaid care to people with Alzheimer disease (AD). Compared with others in their age group, AD caregivers have higher rates of stress, and medical and psychiatric illnesses. Psychosocial interventions improve the health of caregivers. However, constraints of time, distance, and availability inhibit the use of these services. Newer online technologies, such as social media, online groups, friendsourcing, and crowdsourcing, present alternative methods of delivering support. However, limited work has been done in this area with caregivers. Objective: The primary aims of this study were to determine (1) the feasibility of innovating peer support group work delivered through social media with friendsourcing, (2) whether the intervention provides an acceptable method for AD caregivers to obtain support, and (3) whether caregiver outcomes were affected by the intervention. A Facebook app provided support to AD caregivers through collecting friendsourced answers to caregiver questions from participants' social networks. The study's secondary aim was to descriptively compare friendsourced answers versus crowdsourced answers. Methods: We recruited AD caregivers online to participate in a 6-week-long asynchronous, online, closed group on Facebook, where caregivers received support through moderator prompts, group member interactions, and friendsourced answers to caregiver questions. We surveyed and interviewed participants before and after the online group to assess their needs, views on technology, and experience with the intervention. Caregiver questions were pushed automatically to the participants' Facebook News Feed, allowing participants' Facebook friends to see and post answers to the caregiver questions (Friendsourced answers). Of these caregiver questions, 2 were pushed to crowdsource workers through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. We descriptively compared characteristics of these crowdsourced answers with the friendsourced answers. Results: In total, 6 AD caregivers completed the initial online survey and semistructured telephone interview. Of these, 4 AD caregivers agreed to participate in the online Facebook closed group activity portion of the study. Friendsourcing and crowdsourcing answers to caregiver questions had similar rates of acceptability as rated by content experts: 90% (27/ 30) and 100% (45/ 45), respectively. Rates of emotional support and informational support for both groups of answers appeared to trend with the type of support emphasized in the caregiver question (emotional vs informational support question). Friendsourced answers included more shared experiences (20/ 30, 67%) than did crowdsourced answers (4/ 45, 9%). Conclusions: We found an asynchronous, online, closed group on Facebook to be generally acceptable as a means to deliver support to caregivers of people with AD. This pilot is too small to make judgments on effectiveness; however, results trended toward an improvement in caregivers' self-efficacy, sense of support, and perceived stress, but these results were not statistically significant. Both friendsourced and crowdsourced answers may be an acceptable way to provide informational and emotional support to caregivers of people with AD.",10.2196/resprot.6904,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Alzheimer disease; Alzheimer disease and related dementias; caregivers; mobile health; social media; crowdsourcing; friendsourcing; emotional support; informational support; online support,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/resprot.6904)
Comparing a Tailored Self-Help Mobile App With a Standard Self-Monitoring App for the Treatment of Eating Disorder Symptoms: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Tregarthen, J; Kim, JP; Sadeh-Sharvit, S; Neri, E; Welch, H; Lock, J",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2019,"Background: Eating disorders severely impact psychological, physical, and social functioning, and yet, the majority of individuals with eating disorders do not receive treatment. Mobile health apps have the potential to decrease access barriers to care and reach individuals who have been underserved by traditional treatment modalities. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored, fully automated self-help version of Recovery Record, an app developed for eating disorders management. We examined differences in eating disorder symptom change in app users that were randomized to receive either a standard, cognitive behavioral therapy-based version of the app or a tailored version that included algorithmically determined clinical content aligned with baseline and evolving user eating disorder symptom profiles. Methods: Participants were people with eating disorder symptoms who did not have access to traditional treatment options and were recruited via the open-access Recovery Record app to participate in this randomized controlled trial. We examined both continuous and categorical clinical improvement outcomes (measured with the self-report Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire [EDE-Q]) in both intervention groups. Results: Between December 2016 and August 2018, 3294 Recovery Record app users were recruited into the study, out of which 959 were considered engaged, completed follow-up assessments, and were included in the analyses. Both study groups achieved significant overall outcome improvement, with 61.6% (180/292) of the tailored group and 55.4% (158/285) of the standard group achieving a clinically meaningful change in the EDE-Q, on average. There were no statistically significant differences between randomized groups for continuous outcomes, but a pattern of improvement being greater in the tailored group was evident. The rate of remission on the EDE-Q at 8 weeks was significantly greater in the group receiving the tailored version (d=0.22; P <=.001). Conclusions: This is the first report to compare the relative efficacy of two versions of a mobile app for eating disorders. The data suggest that underserved individuals with eating disorder symptoms may benefit clinically from a self-help app and that personalizing app content to specific clinical presentations may be more effective in promoting symptomatic remission on the EDE-Q than content that offers a generic approach.",10.2196/14972,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,mobile health; smartphone; mobile apps; eating disorders; cognitive behavioral therapy; mental health; intervention study,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/14972)

Comparing the Effects of a Different Social Partner (Social Robot vs. Human) on Children's Social Referencing in Interaction,Not mental health,"Tolksdorf, NF; Crawshaw, CE; Rohlfing, KJ",FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION,2021,"Social robots have emerged as a new digital technology that is increasingly being implemented in the educational landscape. While social robots could be deployed to assist young children with their learning in a variety of different ways, the typical approach in educational practices is to supplement the learning process rather than to replace the human caregiver, e.g., the teacher, parent, educator or therapist. When functioning in the role of an educational assistant, social robots will likely constitute a part of a triadic interaction with the child and the human caregiver. Surprisingly, there is little research that systematically investigates the role of the caregiver by examining the ways in which children involve or check in with them during their interaction with another partner-a phenomenon that is known as social referencing. In the present study, we investigated social referencing in the context of a dyadic child-robot interaction. Over the course of four sessions within our longitudinal language-learning study, we observed how 20 pre-school children aged 4-5 years checked in with their accompanying caregivers who were not actively involved in the language-learning procedure. The children participating in the study were randomly assigned to either an interaction with a social robot or a human partner. Our results revealed that all children across both conditions utilized social referencing behaviors to address their caregiver. However, we found that the children who interacted with the social robot did so significantly more frequently in each of the four sessions than those who interacted with the human partner. Further analyses showed that no significant change in their behavior over the course of the sessions could be observed. Findings are discussed with regard to the caregiver's role during children's interactions with social robots and the implications for future interaction design.",10.3389/feduc.2020.569615,wos,Education & Educational Research,child-robot interaction; early childhood education; social referencing; children; social robots; humanoid robots,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2020.569615)
Compassion focused therapy for pain management: '3 systems approach' to understanding why striving and self-criticism are key psychological barriers to regulating activity and improving self-care for people living with persistent pain,Not mental health,"Malpus, Z; Nazar, Z; Smith, C; Armitage, L",BRITISH JOURNAL OF PAIN,2023,"Background: This paper describes the development of an eight-week Compassion Focused Therapy for Pain Management (CFT-PM) group. This group was specifically designed for 'strivers' a sub-group of people with persistent pain who tend to engage in over-activity and resist making reasonable adjustments to their activity levels to accommodate their persistent pain. 'Strivers' tend to cope by ignoring their pain and pushing on through, in the shorter term leading to 'boom and bust' activity-related exacerbations of their pain. They also risk the development of additional persistent fatigue and burnout in the longer term. Method: 117 people completed the CFT-PM group; The group was delivered in person (n = 84) but in online format from July 2020 (n = 33). 162 people started the CFT-PM group but 45 dropped-out (27.43%). Results: There was a significant effect for time across all measures: significant improvement was found for depression, self-compassion, pain-related disability, pain-related anxiety and pain self-efficacy. Pain numeric rating scores were approaching significance. There was a significant main effect of diagnosis; post-hoc t-test analysis found significant improvement for all diagnoses on all measures with the exception of spinal. There was also a significant interaction between time and format: post-hoc t-test analysis found greater improvement for virtual format on self-compassion and pain-related anxiety. Discussion: Findings suggests that CFT-PM may be a clinically effective group intervention with virtual format showing superior improvement. This approach might be less suitable for certain diagnoses; the spinal group may benefit more from traditional CBT-based PMPs. Limitations include the lack of random selection or allocation to treatment group. Future studies should adopt an experimental design to be able to draw firm conclusions regarding causation and efficacy. Despite these limitations, present findings suggest that CFT-PM may be an effective group intervention worthy of further investigation and clinical application.",10.1177/20494637221133630,"pubmed, wos",Neurosciences & Neurology,compassion; pain; strivers; self-compassion; self-kindness; pacing; self-criticism; self-care,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1177/20494637221133630)

Computer and mobile technology interventions for self-management in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,Not mental health,"McCabe, C; McCann, M; Brady, AM",COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,2017,"Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by airflow obstruction due to an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, for example, cigarette smoke. The pattern of care for people with moderate to very severe COPD often involves regular lengthy hospital admissions, which result in high healthcare costs and an undesirable effect on quality of life. Research over the past decade has focused on innovative methods for developing enabling and assistive technologies that facilitate patient self-management. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions delivered by computer and by mobile technology versus face-to-face or hard copy/digital documentary-delivered interventions, or both, in facilitating, supporting, and sustaining self-management among people with COPD. Search methods In November 2016, we searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), which contains trial reports identified through systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO, and we handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that measured effects of remote and Web 2.0-based interventions defined as technologies including personal computers (PCs) and applications (apps) for mobile technology, such as iPad, Android tablets, smart phones, and Skype, on behavioural change towards self-management of COPD. Comparator interventions included face-to-face and/or hard copy/ digital documentary educational/self-management support. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (CMcC and MMcC) independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text study reports for inclusion. Two review authors (CMcC and AMB) independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We expressed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) for studies using different outcome measurement scales. Main results We included in our review three studies (Moy 2015; Tabak 2013; Voncken-Brewster 2015) with a total of 1580 randomised participants. From Voncken-Brewster 2015, we included the subgroup of individuals with a diagnosis of COPD (284 participants) and excluded those at risk of COPD who had not received a diagnosis (1023 participants). As a result, the total population available for analysis included 557 participants; 319 received smart technology to support self-management and 238 received face-to-face verbal/ written or digital information and education about self-management. The average age of participants was 64 years. We included more men than women because the sample from one of the studies consisted of war veterans, most of whom were men. These studies measured five of our nine defined outcomes. None of these studies included outcomes such as self-efficacy, cost-effectiveness, functional capacity, lung function, or anxiety and depression. All three studies included our primary outcome -health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) or St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). One study reported our other primary outcomes - hospital admissions and acute exacerbations. Two studies included our secondary outcome of physical activity as measured by daily step counts. One study addressed smoking by providing a narrative analysis. Only one study reported adverse events and noted significant differences between groups, with 43 events noted in the intervention group and eight events in the control group (P = 0.001). For studies that measured outcomes at week four, month four, and month six, the effect of smart technology on self-management and subsequent HRQoL in terms of symptoms and health status was significantly better than when participants received face-to-face/ digital and/ or written support for self-management of COPD (SMD -0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.40 to -0.03; P = 0.02). The single study that reported HRQoL at 12 months described no significant between-group differences (MD 1.1, 95% CI -2.2 to 4.5; P = 0.50). Also, hospitalisations (logistic regression odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% CI 0.8 to 3.2; P = 0.19) and exacerbations (logistic regression OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.8; P = 0.33) did not differ between groups in the single study that reported these outcomes at 12 months. The activity level of people with COPD at week four, month four, and month six was significantly higher when smart technology was used than when face-to-face/ digital and/ or written support was provided (MD 864.06 daily steps between groups, 95% CI 369.66 to 1358.46; P = 0.0006). The only study that measured activity levels at 12 months reported no significant differences between groups (mean 108, 95% CI -720 to 505; P = 0.73). Participant engagement in this study was not sustained between four and 12 months. The only study that included smoking cessation found no significant treatment effect (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.66; P = 0.895). Meta-analyses showed no significant heterogeneity between studies (Chi(2) = 0.39, P = 0.82; I-2 = 0% and Chi(2) = 0.01, P = 0.91; I-2 = 0%, respectively). Authors' conclusions Although our review suggests that interventions aimed at facilitating, supporting, and sustaining self-managment in people with COPD and delivered via smart technology significantly improved HRQoL and levels of activity up to six months compared with interventions given through face-to-face/ digital and/ or written support, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This improvement may not be sustained over a long duration. The only included study that measured outcomes up to 12 months highlighted the need to ensure sustained engagement with the technology over time. Limited evidence suggests that using computer and mobile technology for self-management for people with COPD is not harmful and may be more beneficial for some people than for others, for example, those with an interest in using technology may derive greater benefit. The evidence, provided by three studies at high risk of bias, is of poor quality and is insufficient for advising healthcare professionals, service providers, and members of the public with COPD about the health benefits of using smart technology as an effective means of supporting, encouraging, and sustaining self-management. Further research that focuses on outcomes relevant to different stages of COPD is needed. Researchers should provide clear information on how self-management is assessed and should include longitudinal measures that allow comment on behavioural change.",10.1002/14651858.CD011425.pub2,"pubmed, wos",General & Internal Medicine,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011425.pub2)

This study intends to evaluate the impact of cognitive training in the treatment of depression, and also of the impairment that depression causes. Method: A program for cognitive training (Alcor) was designed for and applied to a group of patients (n = 10) with non-medicated MDD; a group (N = 10) with MDD that was treated with the program and with anti-depressants, and to another group (n = 11) that was given anti-depressors only. The impact of this intervention was assessed by applying the following instruments: Beck Depression Inventory, WAIS, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Externalized Problems Assessment Scale for Adolescents and Young Adults, and Attention Problems Assessment Scale. The program was applied to University students with MDD twice a week, until they had reached adequate levels of execution. Results: The patients of all three groups showed MDD event remission. Those who received cognitive training showed a substantial increase of intellectual performance. The cognitive treatment group increased IQ in 12.9 units and the combined group increase in 13.3 units. There was a slight decrease of 1.9 units within the anti-depressant treatment group. The changes in attention and in externalized problems showed the same trends. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Computerized and Virtual Reality Cognitive Training for Individuals at High Risk of Cognitive Decline: Systematic Review of the Literature,Not Multi User,"Coyle, H; Traynor, V; Solowij, N",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY,2015,"The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of cognitive training, specifically computerized cognitive training (CCT) and virtual reality cognitive training (VRCT), programs for individuals living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia and therefore at high risk of cognitive decline. After searching a range of academic databases (CINHAL, PSYCinfo, and Web of Science), the studies evaluated (N = 16) were categorized as CCT (N = 10), VRCT (N = 3), and multimodal interventions (N = 3). Effect sizes were calculated, but a meta-analysis was not possible because of the large variability of study design and outcome measures adopted. The cognitive domains of attention, executive function, and memory (visual and verbal) showed the most consistent improvements. The positive effects on psychological outcomes (N = 6) were significant reductions on depressive symptoms (N = 3) and anxiety (N = 2) and improved perceived use of memory strategy (N = 1). Assessments of activities of daily living demonstrated no significant improvements (N = 8). Follow-up studies (N = 5) demonstrated long-term improvements in cognitive and psychological outcomes (N = 3), and the intervention groups showed a plateau effect of cognitive functioning compared with the cognitive decline experienced by control groups (N = 2). CCT and VRCT were moderately effective in long-term improvement of cognition for those at high risk of cognitive decline. Total intervention time did not mediate efficacy.

Condensed Internet-delivered prolonged exposure provided soon after trauma: a randomised trial,Good,"Bragesjö, M; Arnberg, FK; Lauri, KO; Aspvall, K; Särnholm, J; Andersson, E",PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,2023,"Background Exposure to trauma is common and can have a profoundly negative impact on mental health. Interventions based on trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy have shown promising results to facilitate recovery. The current trial evaluated whether a novel, scalable and digital early version of the intervention, Condensed Internet-Delivered Prolonged Exposure (CIPE), is effective in reducing post-traumatic stress symptoms. Method A single-site randomised controlled trial with self-referred adults (N = 102) exposed to trauma within the last 2 months. The participants were randomised to 3 weeks of CIPE or a waiting list (WL) for 7 weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline, week 1-3 (primary endpoint), week 4-7 (secondary endpoint) and at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Results The main analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle indicated statistically significant reductions in symptoms of post-traumatic stress in the CIPE group as compared to the WL group. The between-group effect size was moderate at week 3 (bootstrapped d = 0.70; 95% CI 0.33-1.06) and large at week 7 (bootstrapped d = 0.83; 95% CI 0.46-1.19). Results in the intervention group were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. No severe adverse events were found. Conclusions CIPE is a scalable intervention that may confer early benefits on post-traumatic stress symptoms in survivors of trauma. The next step is to compare this intervention to an active control group and also investigate its effects when implemented in regular care.",10.1017/S0033291721003706,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Psychiatry,early intervention; post-traumatic stress; prolonged exposure; the Internet; trauma,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721003706)

Continuous glucose monitoring with data sharing in older adults: A qualitative study,Other,"Allen, NA; Grigorian, EG; Mansfield, K; Berg, CA; Litchman, ML",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING,2023,"AimsThis study examined the perceptions of the SHARE plus intervention and its effects on communication, collaboration, and involvement in day-to-day diabetes management in older adults with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and their care partners. BackgroundThe SHARE plus intervention includes continuous glucose monitoring with a data sharing app that allows care partners to view glucose data on a smartphone and receive alerts. People with T1D and their care partners are educated about communication strategies, problem-solving strategies, and action planning when using glucose data sharing. DesignQualitative descriptive design. MethodsOlder adults with T1D wore a continuous glucose monitor for 3 months (n = 10). Care partners (n = 10) used a data-sharing app. The SHARE plus intervention consisted of one 90-min education session. Semi-structured interviews were conducted across 10 dyads (person with diabetes and care partner) following the 12-week study. A qualitative description and a constant comparison approach were used to examine similarities and differences in experiences. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analysed for common themes. The manuscript adheres to COREQ EQUATOR checklist. ResultsThe SHARE plus intervention increased diabetes knowledge across the dyads, improving confidence and helping partners understand how to navigate symptoms and behaviours and when to intervene. Dyads worked together to optimise diabetes management through improved communication, collaboration, and management of disagreements. Although the majority of persons with diabetes and their care partners reported no conflictual communication, disagreements about diabetes management remained in some dyads. The SHARE plus intervention impacted care partners in various ways from a psychological perspective. While live-in-care partners felt peace of mind, care partners living away from persons with diabetes had some increased worry and concern. ConclusionThe SHARE plus intervention results can help guide future development of diabetes dyadic care and education interventions using diabetes technology. Relevance to Clinical PracticeThe SHARE plus intervention is a brief, practical intervention that can help diabetes clinicians improve communication and collaboration among spouses living with older adults with T1D who use continuous glucose monitoring with data sharing.

Controlled Study of the Impact of a Virtual Program to Reduce Stigma Among University Students Toward People With Mental Disorders,Other,"Rodríguez-Rivas, ME; Cangas, AJ; Fuentes-Olavarría, D",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2021,"Stigma toward mental disorders is one of today's most pressing global issues. The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the barriers to social inclusion faced by individuals with mental disorders. Concurrently, stigma reduction interventions, especially those aimed at university students, have been more difficult to implement given social distancing and campus closures. As a result, alternative delivery for programs contributing to stigma reduction is required, such as online implementation. This paper reports the results of a controlled study focused on an online multi-component program on reducing stigma toward mental illness that included project-based learning, clinical simulations with standardized patients and E-Contact with real patients. A total of 40 undergraduate students from the Universidad del Desarrollo in Santiago, Chile, participated in the study. They were randomly divided between an intervention and control group. The intervention group participated in the online multi-component program, while the control group participated in an online educational program on cardiovascular health. We assessed the impact of the program by using the validated Spanish-language versions of the Attribution Questionnaire AQ-27 and the Questionnaire on Student Attitudes toward Schizophrenia with both groups, before and after the intervention. In addition, an ad hoc Likert scale ranging from 0 to 5 was used with the intervention group in order to assess the learning strategies implemented. Following the intervention, the participants belonging to the intervention group displayed significantly lower levels of stereotypes, perception of dangerousness, and global score toward people with schizophrenia (p < 0.001). In addition, participants presented lower levels of dangerousness-fear, avoidance, coercion, lack of solidarity, and global score (p < 0.001). The control group displayed no statistically significant differences in the level of stigma before and after the evaluation, for all of the items assessed. Finally, the overall assessment of each of the components of the program was highly positive. In conclusion, the study shows that online programs can contribute to reducing stigma toward mental disorders. The program assessed in this study had a positive impact on all the dimensions of stigma and all of the components of the program itself were positively evaluated by the participants.",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.632252,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,stigma; undergraduate education; E-contact; standardized patient (SP); project based learning (PBL); multicomponent interventions; stigma reduction programme,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.632252)

Comparison of outcomes of an in-person training relaxation program with and without digitalized smartphone components,Not Multi User,"Nagel, A; John, D; Scheder, A; Kohls, N",PRAVENTION UND GESUNDHEITSFORDERUNG,2019,"BackgroundGerman students are avulnerable group that is particularly burdened by psychological strains. Therefore, interventions to reduce psychological strainsespecially innovative approachesare becoming increasingly important.ObjectivesThis partially randomized study with three intervention groups and one control group investigated if the mobile app AOK Relax, amindfulness-based stress management course or acombination of both is capable to reduce psychological strains and to strengthen mindfulness and well-being in students of Coburg University.MethodsAt the beginning (T1) and end (T2) of the intervention period (winter semester 2016/17) participants' mindfulness (Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, FMI-13), well-being (Well-being-index, WHO-D5) and psychological distress (Perceived Stress Questionnaire, PSQ) were measured. Wilcoxon test and Cohensd were calculated to analyze changes during the study period.ResultsStudents solely using the app (n=17) showed an increase in mindfulness (p=not significant [n.s.], d=0.43). Students participating in the course (n=12) also showed increased mindfulness (p<0.01, d=1.10), well-being (p<0.05, d=0.79) and adecrease in psychological distress (p<0.05, d=0.54).

The CAD intervention consists of a 17-module online platform designed to support divorcees and their children post-divorce. Data analyses consisted of linear mixed effect modeling and means comparisons. The study found that the intervention significantly accelerated the reduction of perceived stress among recently divorced adults when compared with controls. Further, after one year, stress levels in the intervention group were reduced to normed national stress levels while the mean stress level in the control group remained substantially higher.

Psychosocial stress management interventions, shown to mitigate the negative impact of these complaints, can now be delivered as accessible and convenient (for the patient and provider) eHealth interventions. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), Coping After Breast Cancer (CABC), 2 modified versions of the stress management eHealth intervention program StressProffen were created: one with predominantly cognitive behavioral stress management content (StressProffen-cognitive behavioral therapy intervention [StressProffen-CBI]) and another with predominantly mindfulness-based stress management content (StressProffen-mindfulness-based intervention [StressProffen-MBI]). Objective: This study aims to investigate the effects in breast cancer survivors of using StressProffen-CBI and StressProffen-MBI compared with a control group (treatment as usual). Methods: Women diagnosed with breast cancer (stage I-III, unequivocally human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive or estrogen receptor-negative tumors) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) aged 21-69 years who completed the Cancer Registry of Norway-initiated health survey on quality of life are invited to the CABC trial about 7 months after diagnosis. Women who give consent to participate are randomized (1:1:1) to either the StressProffen-CBI, StressProffen-MBI, or control group. Both StressProffen interventions consist of 10 modules of stress management content delivered through text, sound, video, and images. The primary outcome is between-group changes in perceived stress at 6 months, assessed with Cohen 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. The secondary outcomes comprise changes in quality of life, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep, neuropathy, coping, mindfulness, and work-related outcomes approximately 1, 2, and 3 years after diagnosis. Long-term effects of the interventions on work participation, comorbidities, relapse or new cancers, and mortality will be assessed using data from national health registries. Results: Recruitment is scheduled from January 2021 to May 2023. The goal is to recruit 430 participants (100 in each group). As of April 14 2023, 428 participants have been enrolled. Conclusions: The CABC trial is possibly the largest ongoing psychosocial eHealth RCT in patients with breast cancer. If 1 or both interventions prove to be effective in reducing stress and improving psychosocial and physical complains, the StressProffen eHealth interventions could be beneficial, inexpensive, and easily implementable tools for breast cancer survivors when coping with late effects after cancer and cancer treatments.

Smoking cessation attempts benefit from social support. Mobile phones have changed the way we communicate through the use of freely available message-oriented apps. Mobile app-based interventions for smoking cessation programs can provide interactive, supportive, and individually tailored interventions. Objective: This study aimed to identify emotions, coping strategies, beliefs, values, and cognitive evaluations of smokers who are in the process of quitting, and to analyze online social support provided through the analysis of messages posted to a chat function integrated into a mobile app. Methods: In this descriptive qualitative study, informants were smokers who participated in the chat of Tobbstop. The technique to generate information was documentary through messages collected from September 2014 through June 2016, specifically designed to support a smoking cessation intervention. A thematic content analysis of the messages applied 2 conceptual models: the Lazarus and Folkman model to assess participant's experiences and perceptions and the Cutrona model to evaluate online social support. Results: During the study period, 11,788 text messages were posted to the chat by 101 users. The most frequent messages offered information and emotional support, and all the basic emotions were reported in the chat. The 3 most frequent coping strategies identified were physical activity, different types of treatment such as nicotine replacement, and humor. Beliefs about quitting smoking included the inevitability of weight gain and the notion that not using any type of medications is better for smoking cessation. Health and family were the values more frequently described, followed by freedom. A smoke-free environment was perceived as important to successful smoking cessation. The social support group that was developed with the app offered mainly emotional and informational support. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that a chat integrated into a mobile app focused on supporting smoking cessation provides a useful tool for smokers who are in the process of quitting, by offering social support and a space to share concerns, information, or strategies.",10.2196/11071,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,primary health care; qualitative research; mobile apps; smoking cessation; social support; psychological adaptation,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/11071)

This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of DIs for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), in comparison with alternative care options, from the perspective of the UK health care system. Methods An open-source decision analytic cohort model was used to extrapolate the results of a network meta-analysis over a patient's lifetime and estimate the costs and outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years) of DIs and their comparators. The net monetary benefit (NMB) and probability of cost effectiveness was estimated for each comparator, and we conducted a Value of Information analysis to evaluate the scale and drivers of uncertainty. Results DIs were associated with lower NMB compared with medication and with group therapy, but greater NMB compared with non-therapeutic controls and with usual care. DIs that were supported by a clinician, an assistant or a lay person had higher delivery costs than purely patient-self-directed DIs, yielding a greater NMB when opportunity cost was above 3000 pound/QALY. There was considerable uncertainty in the findings driven largely by uncertainty in the estimated treatment effects. The value of further research to establish the effectiveness of DIs for GAD was substantial, at least 12.9 pound billion. Conclusions The high uncertainty about these results does not allow for recommendations based on the cost effectiveness of DIs. However, the analysis highlights areas for future research, and demonstrates that apparent cost savings associated with DIs can be offset by reduced effectiveness.",10.1007/s41669-021-00318-y,"pubmed, wos",Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s41669-021-00318-y)

Couples' experiences of using DemPower in everyday life,Not Multi User,"Bielsten, T; Keady, J; Kullberg, A; Lasrado, R; Hellström, I",QUALITY IN AGEING AND OLDER ADULTS,2020,"Purpose Interventions aimed at couples where one partner has dementia are often targeting burden, depression and cognitive function and do not focus on relationship and interpersonal issues. Furthermore, interventions within this population do not seem to have embraced a salutogenic and authentic dyadic approach where both partners' experiences are considered. To address this gap, a self-management app, DemPower, which was piloted and tested among couples where one partner has dementia living at home, has been developed. This study explores couples' everyday experiences of engaging with the DemPower. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews with couples were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings The findings resulted in the following themes: growth of the relationship; we are not alone; and positive approach. The findings indicated that the experiences of a salutogenic and dyadic intervention can contribute to the feelings of empowerment, satisfaction of couples' achievements and a sense of support through peers and with the intervention itself. Originality/value The findings of this study indicate that couples where one partner has dementia appreciate interventions that focuses on a salutogenic approach to their everyday life and relationship. The dyadic intervention contributed to feelings of empowerment, satisfaction of couples' achievements and a sense of support through peers and through the intervention itself. Discussing, inventory and focus on strengths, resources and quality of life can therefore give couples insight in their growth of the relationship and their transitions during the dementia trajectory. Furthermore, this study can serve as an eye opener in health care for the type of support couples need and wishes to receive.

However, family carers are often unprepared for their caring roles, receiving less education and support compared with professional carers. The consequences are their reduced mental and physical health and wellbeing, and that of care recipients. This study protocol introduces the 'Partnership in iSupport program' that includes five interventional components: managing transitions, managing dementia progression, psychoeducation, carer support group and feedback on services. This health services research is built on family carer and dementia care service provider partnerships. The aims of the study are to evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and family carers' experiences in the program. Methods: A multicentre randomised controlled trial will be conducted with family carers of people living with dementia from two tertiary hospitals and two community aged care providers across three Australian states. The estimated sample size is 185 family carers. They will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the usual care group. Outcomes are measurable improvements in quality of life for carers and people with dementia, caregiving self-efficacy, social support, dementia related symptoms, and health service use for carers and their care recipients. Data will be collected at three time points: baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-initiation of the intervention. Discussion: This is the first large randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention on health and social care services with carers of people living with dementia in real-world practice across hospital and community aged care settings in three Australian states to ascertain the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and carers' experiences of the innovative program. We expect that this study will address gaps in supporting dementia carers in health and social care systems while generating new knowledge of the mechanisms of change in the systems.

Current and Future Trends in Internet-Supported Mental Health Interventions,Good,"Barak, A; Grohol, JM",JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY IN HUMAN SERVICES,2011,"Despite growing research in the past two decades involving Internet-supported or online mental health interventions, there has been only a few attempts to provide a synthesis of the research findings and future trends. The Internet has grown exponentially during this time, providing greater access to a wider population than ever before. Consequently, online mental health interventions have the potential to be cost-effective, convenient, and reach a more diverse population than traditional, face-to-face interventions. This paper reviews and summarizes the current research for online mental health interventions and discusses future trends. These interventions range from psychoeducational static webpages and complex, personalized, interactive cognitive-behavioral-based self-help programs, to videoconferencing, self-help support groups, blogging, and professional-led online therapy. Future trends in online interventions include the greater prevalence of online therapy and the use of video chat and videoconferencing technologies to enhance and extend the therapeutic relationship. The use of texting or short message service (SMS), mobile communications, smart phone applications, gaming, and virtual worlds extends the intervention paradigm into new environments not always previously considered as intervention opportunities.

Customizing Your Demons: Anxiety Reduction via Anthropomorphizing and Destroying an Anxiety Avatar,Not Multi User,"Pimentel, D; Kalyanaraman, S",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2020,"Character customization is a prominent feature in digital games, affording users the ability to tailor one's virtual self-representation (avatar) to match aspects of their actual or ideal self, influencing psychological well-being. The mental health implications of character customization can be partially explained by self-discrepancy theory, which argues that achieving congruence with one's avatar reduces cognitive dissonance. However, the role of undesirable self-concepts such as mental health ailments have largely been overlooked in this context despite forming part of one's identity. In theory, customization of an avatar representing undesirable self-concepts presents a self-regulatory paradox: individuals desire to reduce discrepancies with a self-representation, yet they also desire to enlarge discrepancies with a disliked-self. To reconcile this, two experiments explored the psychological implications of imbuing avatars with undesirable self-concepts. In Study 1 (N = 90), participants customized an avatar to represent anxiety within themselves (i.e., an anxiety avatar). Customization significantly reduced state anxiety compared to a control group, supporting the proposed discrepancy-reduction mechanism. Study 2 (N = 122) employed a 2 (customization: yes, no) x 2 (destruction: yes, no) between-subjects design, with participants either destroying or observing an anxiety avatar. Destruction of customized anxiety avatars resulted in the largest reduction in anxiety among all conditions, supporting the proposed discrepancy-enlargement mechanism. Theoretical and practical implications for the use of avatar-based e-mental health interventions are discussed.",10.3389/fpsyg.2020.566682,wos,Psychology,customization; avatar; anxiety; self-discrepancy theory; anthropomorphism; mental health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.566682)
Cyberbullying in elementary and middle school students: A systematic review,Other,"Evangelio, C; Rodríguez-González, P; Fernández-Río, J; Gonzalez-Villora, S",COMPUTERS & EDUCATION,2022,"The goal of the present study was to extend the scope of previous reviews on cyberbullying to focus on elementary and middle school students, ages when research indicates that children begin to use mobile phones and social media. From 2016 to 2020, a total of 43 articles were included in the final selection, and purpose/s, sample, design/instruments, and main findings/conclusions were assessed on each one. The following topics emerged from the results and were discussed: cyberbullying/cybervictimization and psychosocial variables, students' sociodemographic variables, connections between bullying and cyberbullying, students' roles related to cyberbullying, external factors and students' responses, and effectiveness of cyberbullying programs. Students experiencing cyberbullying at an early school age reported negative feelings, such as depression or anxiety. They are often linked to bullying scenarios and even to the same role (cyberbully, cybervictim or cyberwitness). Different programs have been shown to positively influence cyberbullying from a young age, important to prevent it, when children begin to use mobile phones and social media. Protective factors, such as specific pedagogical approaches (e.g. Cooperative Learning or Teaching for Personal and Social Responsibility) or programs, as well as the joined work of different agents (e.g. psychologists, teachers, parents, peers), should be considered to promote a positive evolution on CB prevention. Nevertheless, more studies are needed at these grades, as well as qualitative research designs, to deepen on the students' feelings on cyberbullying.",10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104356,wos,Computer Science; Education & Educational Research,Children; Cybervictim; Cyberwitness; Early school years,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104356)

Cognitive behavioral therapy is the first-line nonpharmacologic treatment for many psychological symptoms and has been successfully delivered by use of mobile technology for symptom self-management. Objectives To determine the feasibility of delivering cognitive behavioral therapy through a smartphone app to family members of critically ill patients. Methods This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study with a consecutive sample of patients admitted to 2 adult ICUs and their family members. The control group period was followed by the intervention group period. The intervention consisted of a mobile health app preloaded on a smartphone provided to family members. The study time points were enrollment (within 5 days of ICU admission), 30 days after admission, and 60 days after admission. Study measures included demographic data, app use, satisfaction with the app, mental health self-efficacy, and measures of PICS-F symptoms. Results The study sample consisted of 49 predominantly White (92%) and female (82%) family members (24 intervention, 25 control). Smartphone ownership was 88%.

"DNA-testing for BRCA1/2 prior to genetic counselling in patients with breast cancer: design of an intervention study, DNA-direct",Not mental health,"Sie, AS; Spruijt, L; van Zelst-Stams, WAG; Mensenkamp, AR; Ligtenberg, MJ; Brunner, HG; Prins, JB; Hoogerbrugge, N",BMC WOMENS HEALTH,2012,"Background: Current practice for patients with breast cancer referred for genetic counseling, includes face-to-face consultations with a genetic counselor prior to and following DNA-testing. This is based on guidelines regarding Huntington's disease in anticipation of high psychosocial impact of DNA-testing for mutations in BRCA1/2 genes. The initial consultation covers generic information regarding hereditary breast cancer and the (im)possibilities of DNA-testing, prior to such testing. Patients with breast cancer may see this information as irrelevant or unnecessary because individual genetic advice depends on DNA-test results. Also, verbal information is not always remembered well by patients. A different format for this information prior to DNA-testing is possible: replacing initial face-to-face genetic counseling (DNA-intake procedure) by telephone, written and digital information sent to patients' homes (DNA-direct procedure). Methods/design: In this intervention study, 150 patients with breast cancer referred to the department of Clinical Genetics of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre are given the choice between two procedures, DNA-direct (intervention group) or DNA-intake (usual care, control group). During a triage telephone call, patients are excluded if they have problems with Dutch text, family communication, or of psychological or psychiatric nature. Primary outcome measures are satisfaction and psychological distress. Secondary outcome measures are determinants for the participant's choice of procedure, waiting and processing times, and family characteristics. Data are collected by self-report questionnaires at baseline and following completion of genetic counseling. A minority of participants will receive an invitation for a 30 min semi-structured telephone interview, e. g. confirmed carriers of a BRCA1/2 mutation, and those who report problems with the procedure. Discussion: This study compares current practice of an intake consultation (DNA-intake) to a home informational package of telephone, written and digital information (DNA-direct) prior to DNA-testing in patients with breast cancer. The aim is to determine whether DNA-direct is an acceptable procedure for BRCA1/2 testing, in order to provide customized care to patients with breast cancer, cutting down on the period of uncertainty during this diagnostic process.

Dance/movement therapy for improving psychological and physical outcomes in cancer patients,Not Digital,"Bradt, J; Shim, M; Goodill, SW",COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,2015,"Background Current cancer care increasingly incorporates psychosocial interventions. Cancer patients use dance/movement therapy to learn to accept and reconnect with their bodies, build new self-confidence, enhance self-expression, address feelings of isolation, depression, anger and fear and to strengthen personal resources. Objectives To update the previously published review that examined the effects of dance/movement therapy and standard care versus standard care alone or standard care and other interventions on psychological and physical outcomes in patients with cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (OvidSP, 1950 to June week 4, 2014), EMBASE (OvidSP, 1980 to 2014 week 26), CINAHL (EBSCOhost, 1982 to July 15 2014), PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 1806 to July 15 2014), LILACS (Virual Health Library, 1982 to July 15 2014), Science Citation Index (ISI, 1974 to July 15 2014), CancerLit (1983 to 2003), International Bibliography of Theatre and Dance (1989 to July 15 2014), the National Research Register (2000 to September 2007), Proquest Digital Dissertations, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Current Controlled Trials (all to July 15 2014). We handsearched dance/movement therapy and related topics journals, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts. There was no language restriction. Selection criteria We included all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of dance/movement therapy interventions for improving psychological and physical outcomes in patients with cancer. We considered studies only if dance/movement therapy was provided by a formally trained dance/movement therapist or by trainees in a formal dance/movement therapy program. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality, seeking additional information from the trial researchers when necessary. Results were presented using standardized mean differences. Main results We identified one new trial for inclusion in this update. In total, the evidence for this review rests on three studies with a total of 207 participants. We found no evidence for an effect of dance/movement therapy on depression (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 0.32, P = 0.89, I-2 = 0%) (two studies, N = 170), stress (SMD = -0.18, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.12, P = 0.24, I-2 = 0%) (two studies, N = 170), anxiety (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.51 P = 0.18, I-2 = 0%) (two studies, N = 170), fatigue (SMD = -0.36, 95% -1.26 to 0.55, P = 0.44, I-2 = 80%) (two studies, N = 170) and body image (SMD = -0.13, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.34, P = 0.58, I-2 = 0%) (two studies, N = 68) in women with breast cancer. The data of one study with moderate risk of bias suggested that dance/movement therapy had a large beneficial effect on 37 participants' quality of life (QoL) (SMD = 0.89, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.57). One study with a high risk of bias reported greater improvements in vigor and greater reduction in somatization in the dance/movement therapy group compared to a standard care control group (N = 31). The individual studies did not find support for an effect of dance/movement therapy on mood, mental health, and pain. It is unclear whether this was due to ineffectiveness of the treatment, inappropriate outcome measures or limited power of the trials. Finally, the results of one study did not find evidence for an effect of dance/movement therapy on shoulder range of motion (ROM) or arm circumference in 37 women who underwent a lumpectomy or breast surgery. However, this was likely due to large within-group variability for shoulder ROM and a limited number of participants with lymphedema. Two studies presented moderate risk of bias and one study high risk of bias. Therefore, overall, the quality of the evidence is very low. Authors' conclusions We did not find support for an effect of dance/movement therapy on depression, stress, anxiety, fatigue and body image. The findings of individual studies suggest that dance/movement therapy may have a beneficial effect on QoL, somatization, and vigor. However, the limited number of studies prevents us from drawing conclusions concerning the effects of dance/movement therapy on psychological and physical outcomes in cancer patients.",10.1002/14651858.CD007103.pub3,"pubmed, wos",General & Internal Medicine,Body Image; Breast Neoplasms [psychology; rehabilitation]; Dance Therapy [methods]; Exercise Movement Techniques [methods; psychology]; Fatigue [rehabilitation]; Neoplasms [psychology; rehabilitation]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Self Concept; Standard of Care; Female; Humans,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007103.pub3)

Decreasing menopausal symptoms of Asian American breast cancer survivors through a technology-based information and coaching/support program,Not mental health,"Im, EO; Kim, S; Lee, C; Chee, E; Mao, JJ; Chee, W",MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY,2019,"Objective: One of the most prevalent and distressing symptoms after breast cancer treatment is menopausal symptoms. Asian American breast cancer survivors have lower quality of life and often receive inadequate management of menopausal symptoms compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Technology-based programs could be a solution to fill the gap in care. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a technology-based information and coaching/support program on menopausal symptoms of Asian American breast cancer survivors. Methods: This study adopted a randomized pretest/post-test group design among 91 Asian American breast cancer survivors (42 in an intervention group who used the program and the American Cancer Society Web site and 49 in a control group who used only the American Cancer Society Web site). The intervention was a theory-driven and culturally tailored intervention program that aimed to provide information and coaching/support using computers and mobile devices. Multiple instruments were used to measure background characteristics and menopausal symptoms at pretest, post 1-month, and post 3 months. An intent-to-treat linear mixed-model growth curve analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The intervention group showed a significant decrease in the distress scores of menopausal symptoms over time: physical (beta = -0.07, P = 0.08), psychological (beta = -0.13, P = 0.05), psychosomatic (beta = -0.17, P = 0.06), and total symptoms (beta = -0.19, P = 0.01).

Deep breathing in your hands: designing and assessing a DTx mobile app,Not Multi User,"Jeong, H; Yoo, JH; Goh, M; Song, H",FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH,2024,"Digital Therapeutics (DTx) are experiencing rapid advancements within mobile and mental healthcare sectors, with their ubiquity and enhanced accessibility setting them apart as uniquely effective solutions. In this evolving context, our research focuses on deep breathing, a vital technique in mental health management, aiming to optimize its application in DTx mobile platforms. Based on well-founded theories, we introduced a gamified and affordance-driven design, facilitating intuitive breath control. To enhance user engagement, we deployed the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC)-driven personalized machine learning method for accurate biofeedback visualization. To assess our design, we enlisted 70 participants, segregating them into a control and an intervention group. We evaluated Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metrics and collated user experience feedback. A key finding of our research is the stabilization of the Standard Deviation of the NN Interval (SDNN) within Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which is critical for stress reduction and overall health improvement. Our intervention group observed a pronounced stabilization in SDNN, indicating significant stress alleviation compared to the control group. This finding underscores the practical impact of our DTx solution in managing stress and promoting mental health. Furthermore, in the assessment of our intervention cohort, we observed a significant increase in perceived enjoyment, with a notable 22% higher score and 10.69% increase in positive attitudes toward the application compared to the control group. These metrics underscore our DTx solution's effectiveness in improving user engagement and fostering a positive disposition toward digital therapeutic efficacy. Although current technology poses challenges in seamlessly incorporating machine learning into mobile platforms, our model demonstrated superior effectiveness and user experience compared to existing solutions. We believe this result demonstrates the potential of our user-centric machine learning techniques, such as gamified and affordance-based approaches with MFCC, which could contribute significantly to the field of mobile mental healthcare.",10.3389/fdgth.2024.1287340,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,digital therapeutics (DTx); Human-Computer Interaction (HCI); mobile health interventions; machine learning feedback; gamification design; user engagement,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2024.1287340)

Due to social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there was a need to adapt and develop a virtual protocol for warrior renew to reach veterans who would otherwise not have access to care. Group exercises were redesigned for video, and class outlines were sent to participants over email. Pre- and postgroup assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) yielded significant decreases with large (.84) and close to large (.77) effect sizes, respectively.

"Delivering Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Insomnia, Pain, and Dysfunctional Eating Through a Text Messaging App: Three Randomized Controlled Trials Investigating the Effectiveness and Mediating Mechanisms",Other,"Li, ACM; Wong, KKL; Chio, FHN; Mak, WWS; Poon, LWH",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Although text messaging has the potential to be the core intervention modality, it is often used as an adjunct only. To improve health and alleviate the distress related to insomnia, pain, and dysregulated eating of people living in urban areas, text messaging-based mindfulness-based interventions were designed and evaluated in 3 randomized controlled trials. Objective: This study investigated the effectiveness and mediating mechanisms of text messaging-based mindfulness-based interventions for people with distress related to insomnia, pain, or dysregulated eating. Methods: In these trials, 333, 235, and 351 participants were recruited online and randomized to intervention and wait-list control conditions for insomnia, pain, and dysregulated eating, respectively. Participants experienced 21 days of intervention through WhatsApp Messenger. Participants completed pre-, post-, 1-month follow-up, and 3-month follow-up self-report questionnaires online. The retention rates at postmeasurements were 83.2% (139/167), 77.1% (91/118), and 72.9% (129/177) for intervention groups of insomnia, pain, and dysregulated eating, respectively. Participants' queries were answered by a study technician. Primary outcomes included insomnia severity, presleep arousal, pain intensity, pain acceptance, and eating behaviors. Secondary outcomes included mindfulness, depression, anxiety, mental well-being, and functional impairments Mindfulness, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep, pain catastrophizing, and reactivity to food cues were hypothesized to mediate the relationship between the intervention and outcomes. Results: For all 3 studies, the intervention groups showed significant improvement on most outcomes at 1-month follow-up compared to their respective wait-list control groups; some primary outcomes (eg, insomnia, pain, dysregulated eating indicators) and secondary outcomes (eg, depression, anxiety symptoms) were sustained at 3-month follow-up. Medium-to-large effect sizes were found at postassessments in most outcomes in all studies. In the intervention for insomnia, mediation analyses showed that dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep mediated the effect of the intervention on all primary outcomes and most secondary outcomes at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, whereas mindfulness mediated the intervention effect on presleep arousal at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. In the intervention for pain, pain catastrophizing mediated the effect of intervention on pain intensity and functioning at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, whereas mindfulness only mediated the effect of intervention on anxiety and depressive symptoms. In the intervention for dysregulated eating, power of food mediated the effect of intervention on both uncontrolled and emotional eating at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups and mindfulness was found to mediate the effect on depressive symptoms at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. Conclusions: These 3 studies converged and provided empirical evidence that mindfulness-based interventions delivered through text messaging are effective in improving distress related to sleep, pain, and dysregulated eating.

Delivering Remote Measurement-Based Care in Community Addiction Treatment: Engagement and Usability Over a 6-Month Clinical Pilot,Other,"Hallgren, KA; Cohn, EB; Ries, RK; Atkins, DC",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2022,"ObjectiveMeasurement-based care (MBC) is an evidence-based practice in which patients routinely complete standardized measures throughout treatment to help monitor clinical progress and inform clinical decision-making. Despite its potential benefits, MBC is rarely used in community-based substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. In this pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of incorporating a digital and remotely delivered MBC system into SUD treatment within a community setting by characterizing patients' and clinicians' engagement with and usability ratings toward the MBC system that was piloted. MethodsA pilot study was conducted with 30 patients receiving SUD treatment and eight clinicians providing SUD treatment in a large, publicly funded addiction and mental health treatment clinic. Services as usual within the clinic included individual psychotherapy, case management, group therapy, peer support, and medication management for mental health and SUD, including buprenorphine. Patients who enrolled in the pilot continued to receive services as usual and were automatically sent links to complete a 22-item questionnaire, called the weekly check-in, via text message or email weekly for 24 weeks. Results of the weekly check-in were summarized on a clinician-facing web-based dashboard. Engagement was characterized by calculating the mean number of weekly check-ins completed by patients and the mean number times clinicians logged into the MBC system. Ratings of the MBC system's usability and clinical utility were provided by patients and clinicians. ResultsPatient participants (53.3% male, 56.7% white, 90% Medicaid enrolled) completed a mean of 20.60 weekly check-ins (i.e., 85.8% of the 24 expected per patient). All but one participating clinician with a patient enrolled in the study logged into the clinician-facing dashboard at least once, with an average of 12.20 logins per clinician. Patient and clinician ratings of usability and clinical utility were favorable: most patients agreed with statements that the weekly check-in was easy to navigate and aided self-reflection. All clinicians who completed usability questionnaires agreed with statements indicating that the dashboard was easy to navigate and that it provided meaningful information for SUD treatment. ConclusionsA digital and remotely delivered MBC system can yield high rates of patient and clinician engagement and high ratings of usability and clinical utility when added into SUD treatment as usual. The success of this clinical pilot may be attributable, in part, to the user-centered design processes that were used to develop and refine the MBC system that was piloted. Future efforts may focus on strategies to test whether MBC can be sustainably implemented and offers clinical benefits to patients in community SUD treatment settings.",10.3389/fpsyt.2022.840409,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,addiction; measurement-based care (MBC); recovery; routine outcome monitoring (ROM); user-centered design (UCD),URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.840409)

Exacerbated by fragile health-care systems, unstable economies, and extensive inequalities, caregiver burden in this region is among the highest in the world. We reviewed the major challenges to caregiving in Latin America and the Caribbean, and we propose regional and coordinated actions to drive future change. Current challenges include the scarcity of formal long-term care, socioeconomic and social determinants of health disparities, gender-biased burdens, growing dementia prevalence, and the effect of the current COVID-19 pandemic on families affected by dementia. Firstly, we propose local and regional short-term strategic recommendations, including systematic identification of specific caregiver needs, testing of evidence-based local interventions, contextual adaptation of strategies to different settings and cultures, countering gender bias, strengthening community support, provision of basic technology, and better use of available information and communications technology. Additionally, we propose brain health diplomacy (ie, global actions aimed to overcome the systemic challenges to brain health by bridging disciplines and sectors) and convergence science as frameworks for long-term coordinated responses, integrating tools, knowledge, and strategies to expand access to digital technology and develop collaborative models of care. Addressing the vast inequalities in dementia caregiving across Latin America and the Caribbean requires innovative, evidence-based solutions coordinated with the strengthening of public policies.",NA,wos,Geriatrics & Gerontology,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/NA)
"Demographic and Indication-Specific Characteristics Have Limited Association With Social Network Engagement: Evidence From 24,954 Members of Four Health Care Support Groups",Other,"van Mierlo, T; Li, XL; Hyatt, D; Ching, AT",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2017,"Background: Digital health social networks (DHSNs) are widespread, and the consensus is that they contribute to wellness by offering social support and knowledge sharing. The success of a DHSN is based on the number of participants and their consistent creation of externalities through the generation of new content. To promote network growth, it would be helpful to identify characteristics of superusers or actors who create value by generating positive network externalities. Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of developing predictive models that identify potential superusers in real time. This study examined associations between posting behavior, 4 demographic variables, and 20 indication-specific variables. Methods: Data were extracted from the custom structured query language (SQL) databases of 4 digital health behavior change interventions with DHSNs. Of these, 2 were designed to assist in the treatment of addictions (problem drinking and smoking cessation), and 2 for mental health (depressive disorder, panic disorder). To analyze posting behavior, 10 models were developed, and negative binomial regressions were conducted to examine associations between number of posts, and demographic and indication-specific variables. Results: The DHSNs varied in number of days active (3658-5210), number of registrants (5049-52,396), number of actors (1085-8452), and number of posts (16,231-521,997). In the sample, all 10 models had low R-2 values (.013-.086) with limited statistically significant demographic and indication-specific variables. Conclusions: Very few variables were associated with social network engagement. Although some variables were statistically significant, they did not appear to be practically significant. Based on the large number of study participants, variation in DHSN theme, and extensive time-period, we did not find strong evidence that demographic characteristics or indication severity sufficiently explain the variability in number of posts per actor.

The purpose of this four-year type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid stepped wedge cluster randomized trial is to: (1) compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of electronic medical record-based clinical decision support [EMR-CDS] versus additional integrated, collaborative behavioral health [EMR-CDS + BHI-CCM] for opioid management of patients with co-morbid chronic non-cancer pain with depression or anxiety; and (2) examine facilitators and barriers to implementing these interventions within 35 primary care clinics in a integrated delivery health system. The EMR-CDS alerts providers to employ opioid risk mitigation and safe prescribing practices at the point of care. The BHI-CCM consists of primary care embedded community health workers for case management; licensed clinical social workers for cognitive behavioral therapy, and a clinical pharmacist for medication management who provide care management via telemedicine (virtual video or audio only visits) under the guidance of a consulting psychiatrist. The primary outcome is reduction in the percentage of patients with average daily opioid dose >= 50 mg morphine equivalent. Secondary outcomes include changes in service utilization, patient reported outcomes and processes of care.

Designing and developing a nature-based virtual reality with heart rate variability biofeedback for surgical anxiety and pain management: evidence from total knee arthroplasty patients,Not Multi User,"Prabhu, VG; Stanley, L; Morgan, R; Shirley, B",AGING & MENTAL HEALTH,2023,"Objectives: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common joint surgeries, with over a million procedures performed annually in the US. Over 70% of patients report moderate to high pain and anxiety surrounding TKA surgery, and 96% are discharged with an opioid prescription. This population requires special attention as approximately 90% of TKA patients are older adults and one of the riskiest groups prone to misusing opioids. This study aimed to develop and compare the efficacy of nature-based virtual reality (VR) with heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVBF) to mitigate surgical pain and anxiety.Methods: This randomized control trial recruited 30 patients (mean age = 66.3 +/- 8.2 years, 23 F, 7 M) undergoing TKA surgery and randomly assigned to a control, 2D video with HRVBF, or VR with HRVBF group. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure pain levels before and after the intervention. In addition, a second VAS and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to measure anxiety before and after the intervention. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was used to continuously measure HRV and respiration rate in preoperative and postoperative settings.Results: VR and 2D-video with HRVBF decreased pain and anxiety post-intervention compared with the control group, p's <.01.

Designing and implementing an innovative digitally driven primary care psychiatry program in India,Population,"Manjunatha, N; Kumar, CN; Math, SB; Thirthalli, J",INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY,2018,"Background: Primary Care Doctors (PCDs) are the first contact for majority of patients with psychiatric disorders across the world including India. They often provide symptomatic treatment which is naturally inadequate. Absence or inadequate exposure to psychiatric training during undergraduate medical education is one of the prime reasons. Classroom training (CRT), a standard practice to train PCDs is driven by specialist based psychiatric curriculum and inherently lacks clinical translational value. Aim and Context: The ` Department of Psychiatry' of ` National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences', Bengaluru, India has recently come up with an innovative digitally driven modules of ` Primary Care Psychiatry Program' (PCPP) for practicing PCDs. Goal of this paper is to provide an overview of all these (five) modules with its various stages of implementation. Methods: Authors briefly discuss the current status of primary care psychiatry in India and also narrate the newly designed five modules of PCPP in this paper. Results and Discussion: An adopted psychiatric curriculum is designed in ` Clinical Schedules for Primary Care Psychiatry' (CSP) which is an integral part of PCPP. This is brief clinical schedules contains culturally appropriate screening questionnaire, transdiagnostic classification of 8 core psychiatric disorders, diagnostic, referral and management guidelines. PCPP contains 5 modules named as orientation module, basic module, advanced module [ Telepsychiatric ` On-Consultation Training' (Tele-OCT)], videoconference based continuing skill development module, and collaborative video consultation modules which covers all essential areas of primary care psychiatry for practicing PCDs. Last three modules are fully designed digital modules in hub and spoke model of Tele Medicine. In this designed program, the CSP and Tele-OCT are two path braking innovations having inbuilt higher clinical translation value. The challenges and opportunities that could be faced during its implementation across India are also discussed. Conclusion and Future Directions: Innovative PCPP is pragmatic in nature and has potential for higher clinical translational value. Once validated thoroughly, PCPP has potential for pan-India expansion.

Detecting Recovery Problems Just in Time: Application of Automated Linguistic Analysis and Supervised Machine Learning to an Online Substance Abuse Forum,Other,"Kornfield, R; Sarma, PK; Shah, DV; McTavish, F; Landucci, G; Pe-Romashko, K; Gustafson, DH",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2018,"Background: Online discussion forums allow those in addiction recovery to seek help through text-based messages, including when facing triggers to drink or use drugs. Trained staff (or moderators) may participate within these forums to offer guidance and support when participants are struggling but must expend considerable effort to continually review new content. Demands on moderators limit the scalability of evidence-based digital health interventions. Objective: Automated identification of recovery problems could allow moderators to engage in more timely and efficient ways with participants who are struggling. This paper aimed to investigate whether computational linguistics and supervised machine learning can be applied to successfully flag, in real time, those discussion forum messages that moderators find most concerning. Methods: Training data came from a trial of a mobile phone-based health intervention for individuals in recovery from alcohol use disorder, with human coders labeling discussion forum messages according to whether or not authors mentioned problems in their recovery process. Linguistic features of these messages were extracted via several computational techniques: (1) a Bag-of-Words approach, (2) the dictionary based Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program, and (3) a hybrid approach combining the most important features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. These features were applied within binary classifiers leveraging several methods of supervised machine learning: support vector machines, decision trees, and boosted decision trees. Classifiers were evaluated in data from a later deployment of the recovery support intervention. Results: To distinguish recovery problem disclosures, the Bag-of-Words approach relied on domain-specific language, including words explicitly linked to substance use and mental health (drink, relapse, depression, and so on), whereas the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count approach relied on language characteristics such as tone, affect, insight, and presence of quantifiers and time references, as well as pronouns. A boosted decision tree classifier, utilizing features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count performed best in identifying problems disclosed within the discussion forum, achieving 88% sensitivity and 82% specificity in a separate cohort of patients in recovery. Conclusions: Differences in language use can distinguish messages disclosing recovery problems from other message types. Incorporating machine learning models based on language use allows real-time flagging of concerning content such that trained staff may engage more efficiently and focus their attention on time-sensitive issues.",10.2196/10136,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,self-help groups; substance-related disorders; supervised machine learning; social support; health communication,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/10136)
Developing Cognition with Collaborative Robotic Activities,Not mental health,"Mitnik, R; Nussbaum, M; Recabarren, M",EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY,2009,"Cognition, faculty related to perception, imagination, memory, and problem solving, refers to internal mental processes through which sensorial input is acquired, elaborated, used, and stored. One of its importances relies on the fact that it affects in a direct way the learning potential. It has been shown that, even thou cognitive processes develop side by side with biological maturity, this cognitive development can be enhanced by means of mediated learning as signaled by Feuerstein's Mediated Learning theory. Based on this theory is that we propose an intervention model that addresses school academic issues using technologically assisted small group collaboration, pursuing a dual academic objective: to thrive students' cognitive processes while addressing school curriculum topics. The purpose, therefore, is to balance the students' cognitive differences by means of in-school content-filled classroom activities. Our aim is to make use of peer mediation in a real world setting with a virtual construction of it. In this paper, we describe this novel intervention model along with an in-school usage experience. For this, we present an activity designed for high school students, specifically aimed to assist the learning of kinematics, graph interpretation, and graph plotting. In this activity the students work in groups of three, using a robot and wirelessly interconnected Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). By means of a controlled experiment, we show how technologically-supported peer mediation promotes the students' enrichment of their cognitive processes in each of the different stages of the mental act (input-elaboration-output), favoring communication skills, insight, and reasoning, while also restraining impulsive conduct and trial-and-error answers.",NA,wos,Education & Educational Research,Cognition development; Robotic assisted teaching; Interactive learning environments; Face-to-face computer supported collaborative learning; Intelligent tutoring systems,URI::(https://www.doi.org/NA)

Suicide prevention strategies can be effective but young people face barriers to accessing them. Providing support digitally can facilitate access, but this can also pose risks if there is inappropriate or harmful content. Collaborative approaches are key for developing digital suicide prevention tools to ensure support is appropriate and helpful for young people. Tellmi (previously MeeToo) is a premoderated UK-based peer-support app where people aged 11-25 years can anonymously discuss issues ranging from worries to life challenges. It has procedures to support high-risk users, nevertheless, Tellmi is interested in improving the support they provide to users with more acute mental health needs, such as young people struggling with suicide and self-harm ideation. Further research into the best ways of providing such support for this population is necessary. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the key considerations for developing and delivering digital suicide prevention tools for young people aged 18-25 years from a multidisciplinary perspective, including the views of young people, practitioners, and academics. Methods: A full-day, in-person workshop was conducted with mental health academics (n=3) and mental health practitioners (n=2) with expertise in suicide prevention, young people with lived experience of suicidal ideation (n=4), and a computer scientist (n=1) and technical staff from the Tellmi app (n=6). Tellmi technical staff presented 14 possible evidence-based adaptations for the app as a basis for the discussions. A range of methods were used to evaluate them, including questionnaires to rate the ideas, annotating printouts of the ideas with post-it notes, and group discussions. A reflexive thematic analysis was performed on the qualitative data to explore key considerations for designing digital suicide prevention tools in the context of peer support. Results: Participants discussed the needs of both those receiving and providing support, noting several key considerations for developing and delivering digital support for high-risk young people. In total, four themes were developed: (1) the aims of the app must be clear and consistent, (2) there are unique considerations for supporting high-risk users: (subtheme) customization helps tailor support to high-risk users, (3) progress is a broad and multifaceted concept, and (4) considering the roles of those providing support: (subtheme) expertise required to support app users and (subtheme) mitigating the impact of the role on supporters.Conclusions: This study outlined suggestions that may be beneficial for developing digital suicide prevention tools for young people.

However, marginalized populations continue to experience avoidable and unjust disparities in cancer care, access to clinical trials, and cancer survival. Racial and ethnic minorities, and individuals with low socioeconomic status, Medicaid insurance, limited health literacy, disabilities, and mental health disorders are more likely to experience delays to cancer diagnosis and less likely to receive guideline-concordant cancer care. These disparities are impacted by the social determinants of health including structural discrimination, racism, poverty, and inequities in access to healthcare and clinical trials. There is an urgent need to develop and adapt evidence-based interventions in collaboration with community partners that have potential to address the social determinants of health and build capacity for cancer care for underserved populations. We established the Virtual Equity Hub by developing a collaborative network connecting a comprehensive cancer center, academic safety net hospital, and community health centers and affiliates. The Virtual Equity Hub utilizes a virtual tumor board, an evidence-based approach that increases access to multi-specialty cancer care and oncology subspecialty expertise. We adapted the tumor board model by engaging person-centered teams of multi-disciplinary specialists across health systems, addressing the social determinants of health, and applying community-based research principles with a focus on populations with poor cancer survival. The virtual tumor board included monthly videoconferences, case discussion, sharing of expertise, and a focus on addressing barriers to care and trial participation. Specifically, we piloted virtual tumor boards for breast oncology, neuro-oncology, and individuals with cancer and serious mental illness.

Mutual support groups are a notable exception. Innovative solutions are needed. SMART Track is a purpose built smartphone app designed to capture ROM data and provide tailored feedback to adults attending Australian SMART Recovery groups for addictive behaviour(s). Objective: Details regarding the formative stage of app development is essential, but often neglected. Improved consideration of the end-user is vital for curtailing app attrition and enhancing engagement. This paper provides a pragmatic example of how principles embedded in published frameworks can be operationalised to address these priorities during the design and development of the SMART Track app. Methods: Three published frameworks for creating digital health technologies (Person-Based Approach, BIT Model and IDEAS framework) were integrated and applied across two stages of research to inform the development, design and content of SMART Track. These frameworks were chosen to ensure that SMART Track was informed by the needs and preferences of the end-user (Person-Based); best practise recommendations for mHealth development (BIT Model) and a collaborative, iterative development process between the multi-disciplinary research team, app developers and end-users (IDEAS framework). Results: Stage one of the research process generated in-depth knowledge to inform app development, including a comprehensive set of aims (clinical, research/organisation, and usage); clear articulation of the target behaviour (self-monitoring of recovery related behaviours and experiences); relevant theory (self-determination and social control); appropriate behavioural strategies (e.g., behaviour change taxonomy and process motivators) and key factors that may influence engagement (e.g., transparency, relevance and trust). These findings were synthesised into guiding principles that were applied during stage two in an iterative approach to app design, content and development.

The treatment group will participate in the metaverse-based social skills training program developed by this research team once a week for 60 minutes per session for 4 weeks. The control group will not intervene during the experiment. The treatment group will use wearable devices during the experiment to collect real-time biometric information. Results: The study is expected to recruit and enroll participants in March 2022. After registering the participants, the study will be conducted from March 2022 to May 2022. This research will be jointly conducted by Yonsei University and Dobrain Co Ltd. Children participating in the program will use the internet-based platform. Conclusions: The metaverse-based Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS) will be effective in improving the social skills of children with ASD, similar to the offline PEERS program. The metaverse-based PEERS program offers excellent accessibility and is inexpensive because it can be administered at home; thus, it is expected to be effective in many children with ASD. If a method can be applied to detect children's emotional changes early using biometric information collected through wearable devices, then emotional changes such as anxiety and anger can be alleviated in advance, thus reducing issues in children with ASD.",10.2196/35960,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",metaverse; social skills; Autism; ASD; digital therapy; Roblox; RCT; social skill; social interaction; human interaction; child; youth; development; wearable; biometric; communication; digital technology; eHealth; mhealth; stress; emotional change; online platform,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/35960)
Development and Evaluation of a Smartphone-Based Chatbot Coach to Facilitate a Balanced Lifestyle in Individuals With Headaches (BalanceUP App): Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Ulrich, S; Gantenbein, AR; Zuber, V; Von Wyl, A; Kowatsch, T; Künzli, H",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2024,"Background: Primary headaches, including migraine and tension-type headaches, are widespread and have a social, physical, mental, and economic impact. Among the key components of treatment are behavior interventions such as lifestyle modification. Scalable conversational agents (CAs) have the potential to deliver behavior interventions at a low threshold. To our knowledge, there is no evidence of behavioral interventions delivered by CAs for the treatment of headaches. Objective: This study has 2 aims. The first aim was to develop and test a smartphone-based coaching intervention (BalanceUP) for people experiencing frequent headaches, delivered by a CA and designed to improve mental well-being using various behavior change techniques. The second aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of BalanceUP by comparing the intervention and waitlist control groups and assess the engagement and acceptance of participants using BalanceUP. Methods: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, adults with frequent headaches were recruited on the web and in collaboration with experts and allocated to either a CA intervention (BalanceUP) or a control condition. The effects of the treatment on changes in the primary outcome of the study, that is, mental well-being (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale), and secondary outcomes (eg, psychosomatic symptoms, stress, headache-related self-efficacy, intention to change behavior, presenteeism and absenteeism, and pain coping) were analyzed using linear mixed models and Cohen d. Primary and secondary outcomes were self-assessed before and after the intervention, and acceptance was assessed after the intervention. Engagement was measured during the intervention using self-reports and usage data. Results: A total of 198 participants (mean age 38.7, SD 12.14 y; n=172, 86.9% women) participated in the study (intervention group: n=110; waitlist control group: n=88). After the intervention, the intention-to-treat analysis revealed evidence for improved well-being (treatment: beta estimate=-3.28, 95% CI -5.07 to -1.48) with moderate between-group effects (Cohen d=-0.66, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.33) in favor of the intervention group. We also found evidence of reduced somatic symptoms, perceived stress, and absenteeism and presenteeism, as well as improved headache management self-efficacy, application of behavior change techniques, and pain coping skills, with effects ranging from medium to large (Cohen d=0.43-1.05). Overall, 64.8% (118/182) of the participants used coaching as intended by engaging throughout the coaching and completing the outro. Conclusions: BalanceUP was well accepted, and the results suggest that coaching delivered by a CA can be effective in reducing the burden of people who experience headaches by improving their well-being.",10.2196/50132,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,chatbot; mobile health; mHealth; smartphone; headache management; psychoeducation; behavior change; stress management; mental well-being; lifestyle; mindfulness; relaxation; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/50132)

The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic made evident the important role that teachers and school counselors play in the mental health of their students. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and implement cost-effective interventions that allow them to identify and address mental health problems early, especially in post-armed conflict areas, to reduce the burden of mental disorders in this population. Objective: This study aimed to adapt an existing patient-focused digital intervention called DIALOG+ from an adult clinical setting to an adolescent educational setting and to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and estimated effect of implementing this intervention as a tool for promoting quality of life, mental well-being, and resilience. Methods: We conducted an exploratory mixed methods study in 2 public schools in postconflict areas in Tolima, Colombia. This study was conducted in 3 phases. In the adaptation phase, focus groups were conducted with students and teachers to identify changes required in DIALOG+ for it to be used in the school setting. The exploration phase consisted of an exploratory cluster randomized controlled trial. A total of 14 clusters, each with 1 teacher and 5 students, were randomly allocated to either the experimental (DIALOG+S) group or to an active control group (counseling as usual). Teachers in both groups delivered the intervention once a month for 6 months. Through screening scales, information was collected on mental health symptoms, quality of life, self-esteem, resilience, and family functionality before and after the intervention. Finally, the consolidation phase explored the experiences of teachers and students with DIALOG+S using focus group discussions. Results: The changes suggested by participants in the adaptation phase highlighted the central importance of the school setting in the mental health of adolescents. In the exploratory phase, 70 participants with a mean age of 14.69 (SD 2.13) years were included. Changes observed in the screening scale scores of the intervention group suggest that the DIALOG+S intervention has the potential to improve aspects of mental health, especially quality of life, resilience, and emotional symptoms. The consolidation phase showed that stakeholders felt that using this intervention in the school setting was feasible, acceptable, and an enriching experience that generated changes in the perceived mental health and behavior of participants. Conclusions: Our results are encouraging and show that the DIALOG+S intervention is feasible and acceptable as a promising opportunity to promote well-being and prevent and identify mental health problems in the school context in a postconflict area in Colombia.

Development and validation of a cost-effective virtual reality educational tool to reduce anxiety and improve set-up accuracy in radiotherapy patients,Not Multi User,"Zhao, QF; Liu, B; Sun, QS; Jin, YQ",CANCER MEDICINE,2023,"Purpose This study proposes a cost-effective method for educating radiotherapy patients through an immersive virtual reality (VR) system. Methods The VR educational tool comprises VR glasses, a handheld controller, the scientific knowledge of radiotherapy, radiotherapy demonstration, and an audio introduction. To verify its efficacy, 120 radiotherapy patients with tumors were prospectively enrolled and divided into the control group or VR intervention group. After the first treatment, set-up errors, including three translation errors and three rotation errors, were recorded in six directions. In addition, participants were required to complete a questionnaire before radiotherapy to assess anxiety and understanding degrees. The questionnaire was scored using a five-point Likert Scale. Finally, Spearman's rank correlation test was used to evaluate set-up errors and questionnaire scores. Results The set-up errors are significantly reduced in AP, SI, total translation, Roll and total rotation in the intervention group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The scores are higher in the intervention group than in the control group in question 1 (2.1 +/- 0.58 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.55), question 2 (1.3 +/- 0.44 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.65), question 4 (2.2 +/- 0.65 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.82), question 5 (1.8 +/- 0.59 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.79), and all subscales (5.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 8.9 +/- 1.3 and 6.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 9.2 +/- 1.5).

Comorbid social anxiety in individuals with psychosis has been associated with poorer premorbid functioning, increased depression, and a reduced quality of life. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is recommended for people with psychosis as a first-line psychological treatment; however, its focus and evaluation primarily revolves around reducing psychotic symptoms and not necessarily targeting comorbid social anxiety symptoms. We developed a novel online social cognitive behavioral intervention (entitled EMBRACE) specifically designed to treat social anxiety symptoms in first episode psychosis (FEP). Methods: The key clinical and engagement features of the intervention were established through integrating evidence-based material derived from 1) CBT-based treatment models for SAD, 2) relevant literature findings related to psychosis and its clinical correlates (e.g., shame, social rank, and its relationship with social anxiety and paranoia), 3) feedback from youth focus groups in order to inform a user-centered intervention design, and 4) a highly multidisciplinary collaborative development approach to design therapy comics. Results: A detailed description of the final version of the 12-week online social intervention to treat social anxiety in FEP is presented.

Implementing online interventions may be an effective way to reach young people, given their familiarity with technology. Objective: This study will assess the effectiveness of a website called the Online Wellbeing Centre (OWC), designed for the support and improvement of mental health and well-being in young Australians aged between 16 and 25 years. As the active component of the study, the OWC will introduce a self-guided app recommendation service called The Toolbox: The best apps for your brain and body developed by ReachOut.com. The Toolbox is a responsive website that serves as a personalized, ongoing recommendation service for technology-based tools and apps to improve well-being. It allows users to personalize their experience according to their individual needs. Methods: This study will be a two-arm, randomized controlled trial following a wait-list control design. The primary outcome will be changes in psychological well-being measured by the Mental Health Continuum Short Form. The secondary outcomes will be drawn from a subsample of participants and will include depression scores measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and quality of life measured by the Assessment of Quality of Life-four dimensions (AQOL-4D) index.

Diagnosing and tracking depression based on eye movement in response to virtual reality,Not Multi User,"Zheng, ZG; Liang, LJ; Luo, X; Chen, J; Lin, MR; Wang, GJ; Xue, CY",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2024,"Introduction Depression is a prevalent mental illness that is primarily diagnosed using psychological and behavioral assessments. However, these assessments lack objective and quantitative indices, making rapid and objective detection challenging. In this study, we propose a novel method for depression detection based on eye movement data captured in response to virtual reality (VR).Methods Eye movement data was collected and used to establish high-performance classification and prediction models. Four machine learning algorithms, namely eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, were employed. The models were evaluated using five-fold cross-validation, and performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, area under the curve (AUC), and F1-score were assessed. The predicted error for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score was also determined.Results The XGBoost model achieved a mean accuracy of 76%, precision of 94%, recall of 73%, and AUC of 82%, with an F1-score of 78%. The MLP model achieved a classification accuracy of 86%, precision of 96%, recall of 91%, and AUC of 86%, with an F1-score of 92%. The predicted error for the PHQ-9 score ranged from -0.6 to 0.6.To investigate the role of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) in treating depression, participants were divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group received CCBT, while the control group received no treatment. After five CCBT sessions, significant changes were observed in the eye movement indices of fixation and saccade, as well as in the PHQ-9 scores. These two indices played significant roles in the predictive model, indicating their potential as biomarkers for detecting depression symptoms.Discussion The results suggest that eye movement indices obtained using a VR eye tracker can serve as useful biomarkers for detecting depression symptoms. Specifically, the fixation and saccade indices showed promise in predicting depression. Furthermore, CCBT demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression, as evidenced by the observed changes in eye movement indices and PHQ-9 scores. In conclusion, this study presents a novel approach for depression detection using eye movement data captured in VR. The findings highlight the potential of eye movement indices as biomarkers and underscore the effectiveness of CCBT in treating depression.",10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1280935,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,depression; diagnose; XGBoost; MLP; CCBT,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1280935)
"Digi-Do: a digital information tool to support patients with breast cancer before, during, and after start of radiotherapy treatment: an RCT study protocol",Not Multi User,"Fristedt, S; Smith, F; Grynne, A; Browall, M",BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING,2021,"BackgroundRadiation Therapy (RT) is a common treatment after breast cancer surgery and a complex process using high energy X-rays to eradicate cancer cells, important in reducing the risk of local recurrence. The high-tech environment and unfamiliar nature of RT can affect the patient's experience of the treatment. Misconceptions or lack of knowledge about RT processes can increase levels of anxiety and enhance feelings of being unprepared at the beginning of treatment. Moreover, the waiting time is often quite long. The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate whether a digital information tool with VR-technology and preparatory information can decrease distress as well as enhance the self-efficacy and health literacy of patients affected by breast cancer before, during, and after RT. A secondary aim will be to explore whether the digital information tool increase patient flow while maintaining or increasing the quality of care. MethodThe study is a prospective and longitudinal RCT study with an Action Research participatory design approach including mixed-methods data collection, i.e., standardised instruments, qualitative interviews (face-to-face and telephone) with a phenomenological hermeneutical approach, diaries, observations, and time measurements, and scheduled to take place from autumn 2020 to spring 2022. The intervention group (n=80), will receive standard care and information (oral and written) and the digital information tool; and the control group (n=80), will receive standard care and information (oral and written). Study recruitment and randomisation will be completed at two centres in the west of Sweden. DiscussionResearch in this area is scarce and, to our knowledge, only few previous studies examine VR as a tool for increasing preparedness for patients with breast cancer about to undergo RT that also includes follow-ups six months after completed treatment. The participatory approach and design will safeguard the possibilities to capture the patient perspective throughout the development process, and the RCT design supports high research quality. Digitalisation brings new possibilities to provide safe, person-centred information that also displays a realistic picture of RT treatment and its contexts. The planned study will generate generalisable knowledge of relevance in similar health care contexts.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04394325. Registered May 19, 2020.

Digital Interventions for Couples: State of the Field and Future Directions,Good,"Knopp, K; Schnitzer, JS; Khalifian, C; Grubbs, K; Morland, LA; Depp, C",COUPLE AND FAMILY PSYCHOLOGY-RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,2023,"Intimate relationship distress harms physical and mental health, and effective couple therapies are underutilized due to barriers to access. Digital couples' interventions (DCIs), including online and mobile programs, can improve access to effective relationship help. This paper outlines the state of the DCI field by describing seven currently available, empirically based DCIs and discussing key design and implementation issues along four key dimensions: Target populations, coaching, linked users, and intimate partner violence (IPV). Analysis of these issues points to a need for greater clarification of whether the program is intended for distressed couples (i.e., prevention vs. treatment) and for coaching models grounded in both theoretical principles and empirical evidence. Further, DCIs must continue to develop ways of addressing issues of safety and privacy that impact IPV risk, particularly when DCIs become available to the public outside the context of a research study. More research on DCIs is needed, both regarding overall effectiveness of the programs and on specific empirical questions regarding the most effective models of coaching, best practices for handling IPV, identifying which couples can benefit most from DCIs, and the role of individual versus dyadic work in self-directed relationship intervention. Although most DCIs are at the early phases of clinical validation, the available outcomes are encouraging and suggest a promising future for DCIs in improving access to effective relationship intervention.",10.1037/cfp0000213,wos,Family Studies,couples; couples therapy; relationship education; digital health; online therapy,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1037/cfp0000213)
Digital Interventions for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis,Good,"Saramago, P; Gega, L; Marshall, D; Nikolaidis, GF; Jankovic, D; Melton, H; Dawson, S; Churchill, R; Bojke, L",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2021,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder is the most common mental health condition based on weekly prevalence. Digital interventions have been used as alternatives or as supplements to conventional therapies to improve access, patient choice, and clinical outcomes. Little is known about their comparative effectiveness for generalized anxiety disorder.Methods: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing digital interventions with medication, non-digital interventions, non-therapeutic controls, and no intervention.Results: We included 21 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2,350 participants from generalized anxiety disorder populations. Pooled outcomes using analysis of Covariance and rankograms based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curves indicated that antidepressant medication and group therapy had a higher probability than digital interventions of being the best intervention. Supported digital interventions were not necessarily better than unsupported (pure self-help) ones.Conclusions: Due to very wide confidence intervals, network meta-analysis results were inconclusive as to whether digital interventions are better than no intervention and non-therapeutic active controls, or whether they confer an additional benefit to standard therapy.

Articles were sourced from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases using subject headings and keywords related to social participation and digital technology. Studies that adopted digital technology interventions to improve social participation in adults with long-term physical conditions were included. Data on study methodology, participant and digital intervention characteristics, and findings related to social participation were extracted. The search yielded a total of 4646 articles and 14 articles met criteria for final review with five randomized controlled trials, two non-randomized clinical trials and seven one-group pretest-posttest clinical trials. Studies were organized based on the digital intervention strategy implemented to improve social participation: group support (n = 4), individual skill training or counseling (n = 6), education and support (n = 3), and mixed intervention (n = 1). The group support interventions developed a social network among participants through videoconference, app, or virtual reality platform. Three studies reported positive improvements in different aspects of social participation. Individual skill training or counseling mainly utilized phone calls to help participants cope with activity participation and interpersonal relationship issues. Only two studies demonstrated benefits for social participation. The education and support intervention, which used messages and website information to increase participants' knowledge and provide support, showed positive findings in three studies. This review suggests digital interventions for improving social participation in adults with long-term physical conditions are feasible and the effectiveness of different strategies may vary.Registration: This review was prospectively registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (registry number: CRD42021254105).",10.1007/s10916-023-01914-7,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,Digital intervention; Mobile health; Social participation; Long-term physical condition,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10916-023-01914-7)

Digital interventions can meet these requirements, especially if personal contact is limited. Objective: We reviewed evidence-based digital interventions that are currently available to help manage physical and mental health in patients with post-COVID/long-COVID symptoms. Methods: A scoping review was carried out summarizing novel digital health interventions for treating post-COVID/long-COVID patients. Using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) scheme, original studies were summarized, in which patients with post-COVID/long-COVID symptoms used digital interventions to help aid recovery. Results: From all scanned articles, 8 original studies matched the inclusion criteria. Of the 8 studies, 3 were pretest studies, 3 described the implementation of a telerehabilitation program, 1 was a post-COVID/long-COVID program, and 1 described the results of qualitative interviews with patients who used an online peer-support group. Following the PICO scheme, we summarized previous studies. Studies varied in terms of participants (P), ranging from adults in different countries, such as former hospitalized patients with COVID-19, to individuals in disadvantaged communities in the United Kingdom, as well as health care workers. In addition, the studies included patients who had previously been infected with COVID-19 and who had ongoing symptoms. Some studies focused on individuals with specific symptoms, including those with either post-COVID-19 or long-term symptoms, while other studies included patients based on participation in online peer-support groups. The interventions (I) also varied. Most interventions used a combination of psychological and physical exercises, but they varied in duration, frequency, and social dimensions. The reviewed studies investigated the physical and mental health conditions of patients with post-COVID/long-COVID symptoms. Most studies had no control (C) group, and most studies reported outcomes (O) or improvements in physiological health perception, some physical conditions, fatigue, and some psychological aspects such as depression. However, some studies found no improvements in bowel or bladder problems, concentration, short-term memory, unpleasant dreams, physical ailments, perceived bodily pain, emotional ailments, and perceived mental health. Conclusions: More systematic research with larger sample sizes is required to overcome sampling bias and include health care professionals' perspectives, as well as help patients mobilize support from health care professionals and social network partners.

More than 22% of Canadians reported that they had felt depressed in the last week, in response to a December 2020 national survey. Given the need to physically distance during the pandemic, and the increase in demand for mental health services, digital interventions that support mental health and wellness may be beneficial. Objective: The purpose of this research was to identify digital interventions that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to identify (1) the populations these interventions were developed for, inclusive of exploring areas of equity such as socioeconomic status, sex/gender, race/ethnicity and culture, and relevance to Indigenous peoples and communities; (2) the effect of the interventions; and (3) any barriers or facilitators to the use of the intervention. Methods: This study was completed using a Cochrane Rapid Review methodology. A search of Embase, PsycInfo, Medline, and Web of Science, along with Google, Million Short, and popular mobile app libraries, was conducted. Two screeners were involved in applying inclusion criteria using Covidence software. Academic articles and mobile apps identified were screened using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields resource, the American Psychiatric Association App Evaluation Framework, and the Mental Health Commission of Canada's guidance on app assessment and selection. Results: A total of 31 mobile apps and 114 web-based resources (eg, telemedicine, virtual peer support groups, discussion forums, etc) that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian population during the pandemic were identified. These resources have been listed on a publicly available website along with search tags that may help an individual make a suitable selection. Variability exists in the populations that the interventions were developed for, and little assessment has been done with regard to areas of equity. The effect of the interventions was not reported for all those identified in this synthesis; however, for those that did report the effect, it was shown that they were effective in the context that they were used. A number of barriers and facilitators to using these interventions were identified, such as access, cost, and connectivity. Conclusions: A number of digital interventions that could support population mental health in Canada during the global COVID-19 pandemic were identified, indicating that individuals have several options to choose from. These interventions vary in their purpose, approach, design, cost, and targeted user group.

Digital phenotyping is a promising method for precise and remote monitoring of patients in their natural environments by using passively generated data from sensors of personal wearable devices. Further studies are needed to better understand the potential clinical benefits of digital phenotyping approaches to optimize care of patients with cancer. Objective: We aim to evaluate whether passively generated data from smartphone sensors are feasible for remote monitoring of patients with cancer to predict their disease trajectories and patient-centered health outcomes. Methods: We will recruit 200 patients undergoing treatment for cancer. Patients will be followed up for 6 months. Passively generated data by sensors of personal smartphone devices (eg, accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS) will be continuously collected using the developed LAIMA smartphone app during follow-up. We will evaluate (1) mobility data by using an accelerometer (mean time of active period, mean time of exertional physical activity, distance covered per day, duration of inactive period), GPS (places of interest visited daily, hospital visits), and gyroscope sensors and (2) sociability indices (frequency of duration of phone calls, frequency and length of text messages, and internet browsing time). Every 2 weeks, patients will be asked to complete questionnaires pertaining to quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30]), depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), and anxiety symptoms (General Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]) that will be deployed via the LAIMA app. Clinic visits will take place at 1-3 months and 3-6 months of the study. Patients will be evaluated for disease progression, cancer and treatment complications, and functional status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) by the study oncologist and will complete the questionnaire for evaluating quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), depression symptoms (PHQ-9), and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7). We will examine the associations among digital, clinical, and patient-reported health outcomes to develop prediction models with clinically meaningful outcomes. Results: As of July 2023, we have reached the planned recruitment target, and patients are undergoing follow-up. Data collection is expected to be completed by September 2023. The final results should be available within 6 months after study completion. Conclusions: This study will provide in-depth insight into temporally and spatially precise trajectories of patients with cancer that will provide a novel digital health approach and will inform the design of future interventional clinical trials in oncology. Our findings will allow a better understanding of the potential clinical value of passively generated smartphone sensor data (digital phenotyping) for continuous and real-time monitoring of patients with cancer for treatment side effects, cancer complications, functional status, and patient-reported outcomes as well as prediction of disease progression or trajectories.

Further behavioral changes included transitioning from working in the office to working from home, with the use of various social media and communication platforms to maintain a level of social connectedness, especially given that many people who were living in different types of communities, such as rural, urban, and city spaces, were socially isolated from friends, family members, and community groups. Although there is a growing body of research exploring how technology is being used by people, there is limited information and insight about the digital practices employed across different age cohorts living in different physical spaces and residing in different countries. Objective: This paper presents the findings from an international multisite study exploring the impact of social media and the internet on the health and well-being of individuals in different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected via a series of online surveys deployed between April 4, 2020, and September 30, 2021. The age of respondents varied from 18 years to over 60 years across the 3 regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. On exploring the associations of technology use, social connectedness, and sociodemographic factors with loneliness and well-being through bivariate and multivariate analyses, significant differences were observed.Results: The levels of loneliness were higher among respondents who used social media messengers or many social media apps than among those who did not use social media messengers or used <= 1 social media app. Additionally, the levels of loneliness were higher among respondents who were not members of an online community support group than among those who were members of an online community support group. Psychological well-being was significantly lower and loneliness was significantly higher among people living in small towns and rural areas than among those living in suburban and urban communities. Younger respondents (18-29 years old), single adults, unemployed individuals, and those with lower levels of education were more likely to experience loneliness. Conclusions: From an international and interdisciplinary perspective, policymakers and stakeholders should extend and explore interventions targeting loneliness experienced by single young adults and further examine how this may vary across geographies.

With the rapid development of digital health technology, researchers investigate how digital interventions may be utilized to support SDM. Despite the promise of digital interventions to support SDM, the effect of these in mental healthcare has not been evaluated before. Thus, this paper aims to assess the effect of SDM interventions complimented by digital technology in mental healthcare. Objective: The objective of this review was to systematically examine the effectiveness of digital SDM interventions on patient outcomes as investigated in randomized trials. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on digital SDM interventions for people with a mental health condition. We searched for relevant studies in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search strategy included terms relating to SDM, digital systems, mental health conditions, and study type. The primary outcome was patient activation or indices of the same (e.g., empowerment and self-efficacy), adherence to treatment, hospital admissions, severity of symptoms, and level of functioning. Secondary outcomes were satisfaction, decisional conflict, working alliance, usage, and adherence of medicine; and adverse events were defined as harms or side effects. Results: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria with outcome data from 2,400 participants. Digital SDM interventions had a moderate positive effect as compared with a control condition on patient activation [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.56, CI: 0.10, 1.01, p = 0.02], a small effect on general symptoms (SMD = -0.17, CI: -0.31, -0.03, p = 0.02), and working alliance (SMD = 0.21, CI: 0.02, 0.41, p = 0.03) and for improving decisional conflict (SMD = -0.37, CI: -0.70, -0.05, p = 0.02). No effect was found on self-efficacy, other types of mental health symptoms, adverse events, or patient satisfaction. A total of 39 outcomes were narratively synthesized with results either favoring the intervention group or showing no significant differences between groups. Studies were generally assessed to have unclear or high risk of bias, and outcomes had a Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) rating of low- or very low-quality evidence. Conclusions: Digital interventions to support SDM may be a promising tool in mental healthcare; but with the limited quality of research, we have little confidence in the estimates of effect.

Recently launched digital early childhood development (ECD) programs attempt to support families with young children in their home environments using digital technologies. However, relatively little is known regarding the effectiveness of these new technologies.Objective: The goal of this study is to rigorously assess the reach, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed digital ECD platform called Afini. The Afini platform was designed to support parents of young children in low-resource settings to improve ECD and interact with caregivers through messenger services and a chatbot.Methods: This is a 3-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. In total, 2471 caregivers and their 3-to 9-month-old children were enrolled in the study across 164 study clusters in the San Marcos, Cajabamba, and Cajamarca provinces of Peru. Clusters of participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: a control group (72 community clusters and 980 caregiver-child dyads), a home visit intervention group (20 community clusters and 316 caregiver-child dyads), and an Afini intervention group (72 community clusters and 1175 caregiver-child dyads). Families in the control group receive no focused ECD intervention. The home visit group is receiving biweekly home visits by a trained field staff following the national ECD program (Programa Nacional Cuna Mas) curriculum and training guidelines. Caregivers in the Afini group are receiving ECD activities and advice through the digital platform. The primary study outcome is children's overall development at the age of 2.5 years, using the internationally validated long form of the Global Scales for Early Development.

However, its large-scale implementation is limited by several constrictions, such as: i) unsolved practicalities of the service workflow, ii) challenges associated to change management in collaborative care; iii) insufficient access to prehabilitation; iv) relevant percentage of program drop-outs; v) need for program personalization; and, vi) economical sustainability. Transferability of prehabilitation programs from the hospital setting to the community would potentially provide a new scenario with greater accessibility, as well as offer an opportunity to effectively address the aforementioned issues and, thus, optimize healthcare value generation. A core aspect to take into account for an optimal management of prehabilitation programs is to use proper technological tools enabling: i) customizable and interoperable integrated care pathways facilitating personalization of the service and effective engagement among stakeholders; ii) remote monitoring (i.e. physical activity, physiological signs and patient-reported outcomes and experience measures) to support patient adherence to the program and empowerment for self-management; and, iii) use of health risk assessment supporting decision making for personalized service selection.

To date, digital health initiatives to support alcohol misuse have focused on male individuals, who represent approximately 89% of the UKAF. However, female veterans drink disproportionally more than female members of the public. Objective: This 2-arm participant-blinded (single-blinded) confirmatory randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to assess the efficacy of a brief alcohol intervention (DrinksRation) in reducing weekly self-reported alcohol consumption between baseline and a 3-month follow-up (day 84) among women who have served in the UKAF. Methods: In this 2-arm single-blinded RCT, a smartphone app that includes interactive user-focused features tailored toward the needs of female veterans and designed to enhance participants' motivations to reduce the amount of alcohol they consume is compared with the UK Chief Medical Officer guidance on alcohol consumption. The trial will be conducted among women who have served at least 1 day of paid service in the UKAF. Recruitment, consent, and data collection will be carried out automatically through the DrinksRation app or the BeAlcoholSmart platform.

Frequently, treatments are not oriented to existing guidelines. In the future, digital elements may be promising tools to support guideline-oriented treatment in a broader range of patients. The cluster-randomized controlled Rise-uP trial aims to support a General Practitioner (GP)-centered back pain treatment (Registration No: DRKS00015048) and includes the following digital elements: 1) electronic case report form (eCRF), 2) a treatment algorithm for guideline-based clinical decision making of GPs, 3) teleconsultation between GPs and pain specialists for patients at risk for development of chronic back pain, and 4) a multidisciplinary mobile back pain app for all patients (Kaia App). Methods: In the Rise-uP trial, 111 GPs throughout Bavaria (southern Germany) were randomized either to the Rise-uP intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). Rise-uP patients were treated according to the guideline-oriented Rise-uP treatment algorithm. Standard of care was applied to the CG patients with consideration given to the National guideline for the treatment of non-specific back pain. Pain rating on the numeric rating scale was the primary outcome measure. Psychological measures (anxiety, depression, stress), functional ability, as well as physical and mental wellbeing, served as secondary outcomes. All values were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and at 3-month follow-ups. Results: In total, 1245 patients (IG: 933; CG: 312) with NLBP were included in the study. The Rise-uP group showed a significantly stronger pain reduction compared to the control group after 3 months (IG: M=-33.3% vs CG: M=-14.3%). The Rise-uP group was also superior in secondary outcomes. Furthermore, high-risk patients who received a teleconsultation showed a larger decrease in pain intensity (-43.5%) than CG patients (-14.3%). ANCOVA analysis showed that the impact of teleconsultation was mediated by an increased training activity in the Kaia App. Conclusion: Our results show the superiority of the innovative digital treatment algorithm realized in Rise-uP, even though the CG also received relevant active treatment by their GPs. This provides clear evidence that digital treatment may be a promising tool to improve the quality of treatment of non-specific back pain.

Digital and Mobile Health Technology in Collaborative Behavioral Health Care: Scoping Review,Other,"Moon, K; Sobolev, M; Kane, JM",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2022,"Background: The collaborative care model (CoCM) is a well-established system of behavioral health care in primary care settings. There is potential for digital and mobile technology to augment the CoCM to improve access, scalability, efficiency, and clinical outcomes. Objective: This study aims to conduct a scoping review to synthesize the evidence available on digital and mobile health technology in collaborative care settings. Methods: This review included cohort and experimental studies of digital and mobile technologies used to augment the CoCM. Studies examining primary care without collaborative care were excluded. A literature search was conducted using 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar). The search results were screened in 2 stages (title and abstract screening, followed by full-text review) by 2 reviewers. Results: A total of 3982 nonduplicate reports were identified, of which 20 (0.5%) were included in the analysis. Most studies used a combination of novel technologies. The range of digital and mobile health technologies used included mobile apps, websites, web-based platforms, telephone-based interactive voice recordings, and mobile sensor data. None of the identified studies used social media or wearable devices. Studies that measured patient and provider satisfaction reported positive results, although some types of interventions increased provider workload, and engagement was variable. In studies where clinical outcomes were measured (7/20, 35%), there were no differences between groups, or the differences were modest. Conclusions: The use of digital and mobile health technologies in CoCM is still limited. This study found that technology was most successful when it was integrated into the existing workflow without relying on patient or provider initiative. However, the effect of digital and mobile health on clinical outcomes in CoCM remains unclear and requires additional clinical trials.",10.2196/30810,wos,Psychiatry,collaborative care; integrated care; augmented care; digital health; mobile health; behavioral health; review,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/30810)
Digital artifacts as mediator tools of cognitive activities of students: possibilities for new learning scenarios,Other,"de Moraes, DAF; de Lima, CM",EDUCAR EM REVISTA,2019,"This paper aimed to investigate to what extent the digital artifacts are consolidated as mediator tools of cognitive activities and what can it provide to young student in their formative process from intentional educational practices.

Digital community assets: Investigating the impact of online engagement with arts and peer support groups on mental health during COVID-19,Other,"Tucker, I; Easton, K; Prestwood, R",SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS,2023,"The digitisation of mental health support has accelerated since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigated the impact of digital engagement with community assets on mental health during COVID-19. Digital engagement is typically not location-bound, but the restricted movement enforced during 'lockdowns' meant that people were primarily accessing digital community assets from their home environments. We report findings from a study utilising two creative workshops and semi-structured interviews to investigate how support operates in and through three digital community assets; an online peer support forum, a social enterprise running regular creative challenges nationally via social media and a local in-person creative arts support group. The concept of 'more or less digital' captures the ways that people's experiences of digital community assets extend beyond the platforms to incorporate settings of use. The analysis identifies how support is diluted through digital engagement, the value of minimal and muted forms of engagement and user-led designs for future hybrid forms of support. The article concludes by emphasising the importance of analysing digital community asset engagement in the settings of use and how such knowledge is vital for planning support in a future under continual pressure to be increasingly digital.",10.1111/1467-9566.13620,"pubmed, wos","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Biomedical Social Sciences; Sociology",art therapy; community assets; COVID-19; digital health; online mental health; peer support,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9566.13620)

Hypertension is associated with impaired cognition, and when combined with MCI, it may lead to a poor prognosis. Digital computerised cognitive training (CCT) has recently become a potential instrument for improving cognition, but evidence for its efficacy remains limited. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a digital adaptive CCT intervention in older patients with hypertension and MCI. Methods and analysis The multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, actively -controlled clinical trial will recruit 200 older (>= 60 years) patients with hypertension and MCI from 11 hospitals across China. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention group (multidomain adaptative CCT) and active control group (non-adaptive cognitive training) for 12-week cognitive training for 30 min/day and 5 days/week. Those who have completed their 12-week training in the intervention group will be rerandomised into the continuation and discontinuation training groups. All participants will be followed up to 24 weeks. Neuropsychological assessments and structural and functional 7.0 T MRI will be obtained at baseline and at 12-week and 24-week follow-up. The primary outcome is the possible improvement of global cognitive function at 12 weeks, as measured by the Basic Cognitive Aptitude Tests. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include the major cognitive domain function improvement, self-efficacy, mental health, quality of life and MRI measurements of the brain.

This is particularly relevant to low-income and middle-income countries where 90% of the world's adolescents live. While digital delivery of behavioural activation (BA) presents a promising solution, its feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness among adolescents in an African context remain to be shown. Methods and analysisThis study is a two-arm single-blind individual-level randomised controlled pilot trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability and initial efficacy of digitally delivered BA therapy among adolescents with depression. The intervention has been coproduced with adolescents at the study site. The study is based in the rural northeast of South Africa in the Bushbuckridge subdistrict of Mpumalanga province. A total of 200 adolescents with symptoms of mild to moderately severe depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire Adolescent Version will be recruited (1:1 allocation ratio). The treatment group will receive BA therapy via a smartphone application (the Kuamsha app) supported by trained peer mentors. The control group will receive an enhanced standard of care. The feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be evaluated using a mixed methods design, and signals of the initial efficacy of the intervention in reducing symptoms of depression will be determined on an intention-to-treat basis.

The program has traditionally been offered in-person or via the web, but has recently been translated into an individualized, customizable mobile intervention to improve access to care and reduce provider burden. The LG app previously showed acceptability with ease of use and satisfaction with user interface, but less success in encouraging self-management. To better understand patient needs, our team conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 individuals with BD who used the LG app for 6 months. These interviews also investigated participant interest in sharing LG app data with their provider through an online dashboard. Using affinity mapping, a collaborative, qualitative data analysis technique, our team identified emerging common themes in the interviews. Through this process, team members identified 494 pieces of salient information from interviews that were mapped and translated into three main findings: (1) many participants found Mood Monitoring and LG modules helpful/interesting and stated the app overall had positive impacts on their mental health, (2) some components of the app were too rudimentary or impersonal to be beneficial, and (3) feedback was mixed regarding future implementation of an LG provider dashboard, with some participants seeing potential positive impacts and others hesitating due to perceived efficacy and privacy concerns.

As part of the German pilot project With us in balance, the potential of six guided internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) to prevent depression among their insurants is examined. The IMI program is tailored to various risk factors of depression, individual symptoms, and needs. Although IMIs have been shown to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms, there is little qualitative research about the acceptance of digital preventive IMIs. The aim of this qualitative study is to gain insights into participants' experiences with the guided IMIs by focusing on determinants for acceptance and satisfaction. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22/171 (13 %) intervention group (IG) participants of a randomized controlled trial. The interview guide was developed based on theoretical models of user acceptance (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) and patient satisfaction (evaluation model, discrepancy theory). The interviews were evaluated independently by two coders performing a deductive-inductive content analysis and attaining a substantial level of agreement (K = 0.73). Results: The qualitative analysis revealed 71 determinants for acceptance and satisfaction across ten dimensions: performance expectancy, organisation, e-coach, usability, training content and structure, training usage, training outcome, financing, social influence, and behavioural intention. The most frequently identified drivers for the IMI use include location independence, positive relationship to the e-coach (each n = 19, 86 %), personal ecoach guidance, expertise of the e-coach, target group specific adaptation (each n = 18, 82 %), flexibility, high willingness for renewed participation (each n = 17, 77 %), fast and easy availability, training of health enhancing attitudes and behaviours and content with figurative expressions (each n = 16, 73 %). Discussion: The qualitative findings predominantly suggest the acceptance of and satisfaction with the IMI program for the prevention of depression in famers and related lines of work. Many identified positive drivers are related to the e-coach guidance, which emphasizes its importance in the preventive setting from the perspective of the participants. Nevertheless, some negative aspects have been identified which help to understand potential weaknesses of the IMI program. Participants indicated different needs in terms of IMI content and usage, which points towards the potential benefit of individualisation. The possibility of being able to use IMIs anonymously, flexibly and independently of location might be highly relevant for this specific target group.",10.1016/j.invent.2022.100566,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Psychiatry,Prevention; Tailored internet interventions; Participant's experience; Mental health; Farmers; Implementation,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2022.100566)

The availability of, access to, and outreach of these in-person interventions are limited, however. The current study, therefore, evaluated the efficacy of StressProffen, a digital application (app)-based stress management intervention for cancer survivors, in a 12-month randomized controlled trial. METHODS Cancer survivors 1 year or less after their treatment (N = 172) were randomized to the StressProffen intervention (n = 84) or a usual-care control group (n = 88). The intervention was delivered in a simple blended care model: 1) 1 in-person introduction session, 2) 10 app-based cognitive-behavioral stress management modules, and 3) 2 follow-up phone calls. Stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), self-regulatory fatigue (Self-Regulatory Fatigue 18), and health-related quality of life (HRQOL; RAND-36) were examined at the baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Generalized linear models for repeated measures were fitted to compare effects over time. RESULTS Participants were mainly female (82%), had a mean age of 52 years (standard deviation, 11.3 years; range, 20-78 years), and had a variety of cancer types (mostly breast cancer [48%]). Over the 12-month study time, the intervention group reported significantly decreased stress (P < .001), depression (P = .003), and self-regulatory fatigue (P = .002) as well as improved HRQOL (for 6 of 8 domains, P <= .015) in comparison with controls. The largest favored effects for the intervention group were observed at 6 months: stress (estimated mean difference [MD], -5.1; P < .001), anxiety (MD, -1.4; P = .015), depression (MD, -2.1; P < .001), self-regulatory fatigue (MD, -4.9; P < .001), and HRQOL (7 of 8 domains; P <= .037).

The search included articles from inception to 19 April 2019 without language restrictions. The search was updated on 7 June 2020 without additional findings. Eligibility criteria Prospective interventional studies reporting multimorbid participants employing interventions with at least one digital telemedicine component were included. Primary outcomes were patient physical or mental health outcomes, health-related quality of life scores and the utilisation of health services. Results Out of 5865 studies initially identified, 7 articles, reporting on 6 studies were retained (total of 699 participants). Four of these studies reported interventions including integration with usual care, two studies had interventions with no links to usual patient care. Follow-up periods lasted between 2 and 6 months. Among the studies with links to usual care, the primary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP) (three studies), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (three studies), total cholesterol (two studies) and self-perceived health status (one study). The evidence ranged from very low to moderate certainty. Meta-analysis showed a moderate decrease in SBP (8 mm Hg (95% CI 4.6 to 11.4)), a small to moderate decrease in HbA1c (0.46 mg/dL (95% CI 0.25 to 0.67)) and moderate decrease in total cholesterol (cholesterol 16.5 mg/dL (95% CI 8.1 to 25.0)) in the intervention groups. There was an absence of evidence for self-perceived health status. Among the studies with no links to usual care, time to hospitalisation (median time to hospitalisation 113.4 days intervention and 104.7 days control group, absolute difference 12.7 days) and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (intervention group 35.2 score points, control group 23.9 points, absolute difference 11.3, 95% CI 5.5 to 17.1) showed small reductions.

There are numerous telehealth solutions that could be utilized to assist with integration efforts that have the potential to be successfully used alone or in combination. This will require that the developers of such technologies understand the current evidence base for effective integration efforts and apply this knowledge to new solutions. Recent Findings Evidence-based models of integrated care such as the collaborative care model have a robust evidence base including studies that demonstrate effective delivery from remote locations. Technology solutions that can serve as practice extenders by performing some of the tasks, and can expand the competency of primary care providers to treatmild to moderate mental illness, have an emerging literature in the behavioral health arena that shows promise for integrating care.

Do Soft Skills Predict Surgical Performance?,Not mental health,"Maschuw, K; Schlosser, K; Kupietz, E; Slater, EP; Weyers, P; Hassan, I",WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY,2011,"Virtual reality (VR) training in minimal invasive surgery (MIS) is feasible in surgical residency and beneficial for the performance of MIS by surgical trainees. Research on stress-coping of surgical trainees indicates the additional impact of soft skills on VR performance in the surgical curriculum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of structured VR training and soft skills on VR performance of trainees. The study was designed as a single-center randomized controlled trial. Fifty first-year surgical residents with limited experience in MIS (camera navigation in laparoscopic cholecystectomy only) were randomized for either 3 months of VR training or no training. Basic VR performance and defined soft skills (self-efficacy, stress-coping, and motivation) were assessed prior to randomization using basic modules of the VR simulator LapSim(A (R)) and standardized psychological questionnaires. Three months after randomization VR performance was reassessed. Outcome measurement was based on the results derived from the most complex of the basic VR modules (diathermy cutting) as the primary end point. A correlation analysis of the VR end-point performance and the psychological scores was done in both groups. Structured VR training enhanced VR performance of surgical trainees. An additional correlation to high motivational states (P < 0.05) was found. Low levels of self-efficacy and negative stress-coping were related to poor VR performance in the untrained control group (P < 0.05). This correlation was absent in the trained intervention group (P > 0.05). Low self-efficacy and negative stress-coping strategies seem to predict poor VR performance.

Do Stay-at-Home Exercise Videos Induce Behavioral Changes in College Students? A Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Fukui, K; Suzuki, Y; Kaneda, K; Kuroda, S; Komiya, M; Maeda, N; Urabe, Y",SUSTAINABILITY,2021,"The coronavirus disease pandemic has led to college students spending more time at home. Stay-at-home exercise  videos to mitigate inactivity are currently available on various digital platforms; however, it is unclear whether these videos lead to behavioral changes among college students. This study aimed to investigate the improvement in physical activity (PA) resulting from stay-at-home exercise  among college students. Overall, 150 college students were recruited, and 125 students (control group: 65; intervention group: 60) who completed baseline surveys were analyzed. The preliminary outcomes were PA, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), subjective well-being (SWB), and psychological stress (K6). Mixed model repeated-measure analysis of variance compared the outcomes before and after the intervention. After 8 weeks of stay-at-home exercise , there was no significant interaction in PA (F = 0.02, p = 0.89); however, a significant interaction for the general health subscale of HRQoL (F = 9.52), SWB (F = 6.70), and K6 (F = 7.83) was detected (p < 0.05).

Do educational games affect students' achievement emotions? Evidence from a meta-analysis,Other,"Lei, H; Wang, CX; Chiu, MM; Chen, SY",JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,2022,"Background Researchers debate whether game-based learning (GBL) affects students' achievement emotions, as past studies yielded mixed results. Objectives This study determines the overall effect of GBL on students' positive achievement emotion and their negative achievement emotions (PAEs, NAEs), along with their moderators. Methods This meta-analysis examined true or quasi-experimental studies, reported in English or Chinese, and with students (ranging from primary schools to universities) who did not report physiological and/or psychological illnesses. Results Compared to traditional instruction, GBL had a positive effect on students' PAEs (g =0.526, k = 39, 95% CI = [0.319, 0.733]) and a negative effect on NAEs (g = -0.517, k = 22, 95% CI = [-0.709, -0.324]). GBL's positive effects on students' PAEs were (a) largest in middle school and otherwise generally larger in higher grades, and (b) largest for competition GBLs (compared to cooperative or individual GBLs). GBL's negative effects on students' NAEs were (a) larger in collectivist cultures than individualistic ones, (b) progressively larger in primary school, middle school, and university, (c) larger for non-digital games than digital games, (d) smallest for individual games, (e) progressively larger in mathematics, social sciences, language, science, and highest in engineering and technology, and (f) smallest for extremely short or extremely long intervention durations (very short: up to 45 min; very long: over 2 months). Take Away GBL often increases students' PAEs and decreases their NAEs, though their effect sizes differ across cultural values, grade level, game type, academic subject, or intervention duration.

Do games reduce maths anxiety? A meta-analysis,Not mental health,"Dondio, P; Gusev, V; Rocha, M",COMPUTERS & EDUCATION,2023,"In this paper, we present the first meta-analysis of the efficacy of game-based interventions on reducing students' levels of maths anxiety. After searching for randomised studies describing game-based interventions to reduce maths anxiety, 22 effect sizes with 913 participants described in 15 peer-review articles met the selection criteria. A random effects meta-analysis indicated a reduction of maths anxiety with a small effect size (mean effect size ES = -0.24, CI = [ -0.47, -0.01]), marginally significant at 0.05 level but not robust to a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. Several factors moderated the results: non-digital games were more effective, while digital games had a negligible mean effect size of ES = -0.10, CI = [ -0.24, 0.03]. The effect size was also moderated by the total duration of the intervention, to the advantage of longer interventions, and by the type of gameplay: games had a greater effect on maths anxiety reduction when they promoted collaborative and social interactions. Such features were mainly present in non-digital games, while all bar one of the digital interventions used single-player games. The results ob-tained, which were particularly weak for digital games, indicated the need to develop and test games explicitly designed for maths-anxious students to increase the impact of game-based in-terventions. This will require investigation into the relationship between game features and maths anxiety through analysis of the behaviour of anxious and non-anxious students at play. Among the features that an anxiety-aware game could employ, we suggest collaborative gameplay, social interactions, adaptability, features promoting intrinsic motivation and embedding real-time measurements of maths anxiety in the game.",10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104650,wos,Computer Science; Education & Educational Research,Maths anxiety; Game -based learning; Meta -analysis,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104650)
Does Justice Need to be in the Eyes of Both Beholders? Examining Face-to-Face and Virtual Negotiators' Interactional Justice Congruence,Other,"Kleshinski, CE; Wilson, KS; DeRue, DS; Conlon, DE",NEGOTIATION AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT RESEARCH,2023,"We build from justice and negotiation scholars' historical interest in interpersonal interactions and reciprocity to develop the notion of interactional justice congruence, which refers to the degree of reciprocity in negotiation dyad members' respectful and truthful treatment of one another. Yet, media richness theory holds that communication media differ in their provision of social cues and ability to interpret subjective information such as justice perceptions. Integrating social exchange theory tenets with media richness theory, we examine how communication medium influences the effects of negotiators' interactional justice congruence on their dyadic economic and social-psychological outcomes. Moderated polynomial regression and response surface analyses of data from 199 face-to-face and virtual negotiation dyads revealed that face to-face dyads' relationship conflict and outcome inequality were minimized when negotiators' interpersonal and informational justice perceptions were congruent-even if both negotiators perceived one another be disrespectful or deceptive. Virtual negotiation dyads did not experience this benefit. This suggests justice functions differently at the dyadic level in negotiations, such that justice needs to be similarly perceived by both face-to-face negotiators in order to produce dyadic benefits.",10.34891/2022.555,wos,Psychology; Business & Economics,negotiation organizational justice; communication polynomial; regression and response surface; methodology dyads,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.34891/2022.555)

Limited research exists about the frequency of SSEs during VRE treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and no research compares self-reported SSEs for those undergoing VRE with those participating in exposure therapy without virtual reality. This study compared the SSEs of active duty soldiers with PTSD randomly assigned to exposure therapy through traditional prolonged exposure or VRE.Methodology:A total of 108 soldiers participated in up to 10 sessions of exposure therapy. Of those, 93 provided data on simulator sickness both before and after initiation of imaginal exposure. Approximately half (n=49) used the Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan system to support engagement with their trauma memory. Soldiers completed a 4-item, self-reported measure of SSE after each session.Results:Controlling for age, gender, baseline anxiety symptoms, and SSE symptom counts at the first two sessions of therapy (before initiating imaginal exposure), there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in SSEs at the beginning of imaginal exposure or over the course of treatment.Conclusions:This finding suggests that caution should be exercised in the interpretation of SSE measurements during the use of VRE for PTSD.

"Domains, Feasibility, Effectiveness, Cost, and Acceptability of Telehealth in Aging Care: Scoping Review of Systematic Reviews",Other,"Zhang, YC; Leuk, JSP; Teo, WP",JMIR AGING,2023,"Background: Aging is becoming a major global challenge. Compared with younger adults, the older population has greater health needs but faces inadequate access to appropriate, affordable, and high-quality health care. Telehealth can remove geographic and time boundaries, as well as enabling socially isolated and physically homebound people to access a wider range of care options. The impacts of different telehealth interventions in terms of their effectiveness, cost, and acceptability in aging care are still unclear. Objective: This scoping review of systematic reviews aimed to provide an overview of the domains of telehealth implemented in aging care; synthesize evidence of telehealth's feasibility, effectiveness, cost benefits, and acceptability in the context of aging care; identify gaps in the literature; and determine the priorities for future research. Methods: Guided by the methodological framework of the Joanna Briggs Institute, we reviewed systematic reviews concerning all types of telehealth interventions involving direct communication between older users and health care providers. In total, 5 major electronic databases, PubMed, Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and PsycINFO (EBSCO), were searched on September 16, 2021, and an updated search was performed on April 28, 2022, across the same databases as well as the first 10 pages of the Google search. Results: A total of 29 systematic reviews, including 1 post hoc subanalysis of a previously published large Cochrane systematic review with meta-analysis, were included. Telehealth has been adopted in various domains in aging care, such as cardiovascular diseases, mental health, cognitive impairment, prefrailty and frailty, chronic diseases, and oral health, and it seems to be a promising, feasible, effective, cost-effective, and acceptable alternative to usual care in selected domains. However, it should be noted that the generalizability of the results might be limited, and further studies with larger sample sizes, more rigorous designs, adequate reporting, and more consistently defined outcomes and methodologies are needed. The factors affecting telehealth use among older adults have been categorized into individual, interpersonal, technological, system, and policy levels, which could help direct collaborative efforts toward improving the security, accessibility, and affordability of telehealth as well as better prepare the older population for digital inclusion. Conclusions: Although telehealth remains in its infancy and there is a lack of high-quality studies to rigorously prove the feasibility, effectiveness, cost benefit, and acceptability of telehealth, mounting evidence has indicated that it could play a promising complementary role in the care of the aging population.",10.2196/40460,wos,Geriatrics & Gerontology; Medical Informatics,telehealth; telemedicine; telecare; telemonitoring; aging care; health care access; scoping review; digital health; mobile health; mHealth; eHealth,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/40460)

Delivering these interventions via electronic health (eHealth) may help increase their scalability. Objective: This scoping review aimed to provide the first comprehensive overview of dyadic eHealth interventions for individuals of all ages affected by mental or physical illness and their family members or friends who support them. The goal was to understand how dyadic eHealth interventions have been used and to highlight areas of research needed to advance dyadic eHealth intervention development and dissemination. Methods: A comprehensive electronic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PsycINFO was conducted for articles published in the English language through March 2019. Eligible records described a psychosocial eHealth intervention that intervened with both care recipients and their support person. Results: A total of 7113 records were reviewed of which 101 met eligibility criteria. There were 52 unique dyadic eHealth interventions identified, which were tested across 73 different trials. Of the unique interventions, 33 were conducted among dyads of children and their supporting parent, 1 was conducted with an adolescent-young adult care recipient population, and the remaining 18 were conducted among adult dyads. Interventions targeting pediatric dyads most commonly addressed a mental health condition (n=10); interventions targeting adult dyads most commonly addressed cancer (n=9). More than three-fourths of interventions (n=40) required some human support from research staff or clinicians. Most studies (n=64) specified one or more primary outcomes for care recipients, whereas less than one-fourth (n=22) specified primary outcomes for support persons. Where specified, primary outcomes were most commonly self-reported psychosocial or health factors for both care recipients (n=43) and support persons (n=18). Results of the dyadic eHealth intervention tended to be positive for care recipients, but evidence of effects for support persons was limited because of few studies specifying primary outcomes for supporters. Trials of dyadic eHealth interventions were most commonly randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n=44), and RCTs most commonly compared the dyadic eHealth intervention to usual care alone (n=22). Conclusions: This first comprehensive review of dyadic eHealth interventions demonstrates that there is substantial, diverse, and growing literature supporting this interventional approach. However, several significant gaps were identified. Few studies were designed to evaluate the unique effects of dyadic interventions relative to individual interventions. There was also limited assessment and reporting of outcomes for support persons, and there were no interventions meeting our eligibility criteria specifically targeting the needs of older adult dyads.

Objective: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of an electronic learning (e-learning) module on the adherence to suicide prevention guidelines, knowledge of practical skills, and provider's confidence to have a conversation about suicidal behavior with undergraduate psychology students. Methods: The e-learning module, comprising video recordings of therapist-patient interactions, was designed with the aim of transferring knowledge about suicide prevention guideline recommendations. The program's effects on guideline adherence, self-evaluated knowledge, and provider's confidence were assessed using online questionnaires before the program (baseline and at 1 month [T1] and 3 months after baseline). The eligible third- and fourth-year undergraduate psychology students were randomly allocated to the e-learning (n=211) or to a waitlist control condition (n=187), with access to the intervention after T1. Results: Overall, the students evaluated e-learning in a fairly positive manner. The intention-to-treat analysis showed that the students in the intervention condition (n=211) reported higher levels of self-evaluated knowledge, provider's confidence, and guideline adherence than those in the waitlist control condition (n=187) after receiving the e-learning module (all P values < .001). When comparing the scores at the 1- and 3-month follow-up, after both groups had received access to the e-learning module, the completers-only analysis showed that the levels of knowledge, guideline adherence, and confidence remained constant (all P values >.05) within the intervention group, whereas a significant improvement was observed in the waitlist control group (all P values< .05). Conclusions: An e-learning intervention on suicide prevention could be an effective first step toward improved knowledge of clinical skills.

Tailored post-discharge services could support a successful readjustment and accompany the high-risk transition period after discharge. The study DigiPuR (Digital gestutzte Psychotherapie und Reintegration, digitally supported psychotherapy and reintegration) aims to establish and to evaluate an innovative digital aftercare program to alleviate challenges during reintegration and improve cross-sectoral care. Methods: DigiPuR is a randomized controlled trial comparing a digital aftercare service with regular aftercare (TAU) (planned N = 150, 25 children/adolescents, 25 parents, and 25 teachers in each group). In the intervention group, direct communication via secure and regular video calls until 8 weeks after discharge and a secure messenger system between the hospital, family, and school, as well as, if needed, external support systems, are established.

Rehabilitation is recommended in sarcoidosis to improve exercise capacity. Therefore, focus on creating different and flexible rehabilitation options adapted to the needs of working patients is warranted to keep patients with sarcoidosis employed and to reduce the socioeconomic burden. Telerehabilitation (TR) might be an alternative. We investigated the usefulness and effectiveness of TR on exercise capacity in patients with sarcoidosis. Method: Single-center, prospective, randomized study including stable patients with sarcoidosis who were enrolled in either a control group where they received the usual standard of care (not including rehabilitation) or in the 3 months TR group composed of video and chat-consultations with a physiotherapist and workout sessions with a virtual autonomous physiotherapist agent (VAPA) (1). 6-minute-walk-test (6MWT), forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), isometric voluntary contraction (MVC), 7 days pedometry, Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire for interstitial lung disease (SGRQ-I), The King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Questionnaire (KBILD) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 Questionnaire (GAD7) were tested before and after 3 months of TR, and after 3-and 6 months follow-up. Patient satisfaction was measured with a 5-point scale (5 very satisfied) and adherence was calculated as percent of tasks and time spent training. Adverse events were documented. Results: Thirty patients aged 53.9 +/- 13.5 years, male 63.3%, FVC% 88.9 +/- 18.8, DLCO% 65.2 +/- 16.0, 6MWT 513.1 +/- 141.3 were included.

Early in the pandemic, our program implemented a virtual mental health crisis ward (vWard) to provide options for individuals requiring intense psychiatric and/or crisis support but who preferred to remain in the community and were deemed safe to do so. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify early learnings from the vWard, which was implemented rapidly in a resource-constrained environment, to inform the future state should it be sustained beyond the pandemic. Methods: Mixed methods of data collection were used to evaluate provider perspectives on the vWard, develop archetypes for individuals who are a good fit for the vWard model, and create a driver diagram. Data sources included an anonymous survey of clinical and managerial staff involved in the vWard, a service planning workshop, and program discharge forms for all individuals admitted between March 2020 and April 2021. Survey responses were coded for themes under categories of benefits and challenges. Discharge forms where the team indicated that the vWard was a good fit for an individual were examined for characteristics common to these admissions. These findings were reviewed in the service planning workshop and refined with input from the participants into patient archetypes. A driver diagram was created for the future state. Results: Survey respondents (N=60) represented diverse roles in crisis services and the vWard team. Ten providers took part in the service planning workshop. A total of 467 discharge forms were reviewed. The vWard was felt to be a model that worked by 39 survey respondents, one respondent felt it did not work, and the remaining participants had no response. Several benefits for the individual and the system were identified alongside challenges, including certain processes and materials related to the nature of rapid implementation during the pandemic, and others due to lack of fit for certain individuals. The model was felt to be a good fit for 67.5% of admissions. Four patient archetypes representing a good fit with the model were developed. The driver diagram connected the program aim with primary drivers of (1) reduce barriers to care; (2) improve outcomes; and (3) provide collaborative, patient- and family-centered care to secondary drivers and interventions that leveraged virtual technology among other crisis care interventions.

Hypertension is a self-contained systemic ailment characterised by elevated arterial blood pressure, leading to detrimental effects on various organs such as the heart, brain, kidneys, and other bodily systems. The term high refers to a state or condition that is elevated or above average. Hypertension is a prevalent and highly morbid condition within the cardiovascular system. The prevalence of hypertension in our nation is experiencing an upward trend, with a concomitant rise in the proportion of hypertensive adults observed annually. Currently, the predominant approach to managing hypertension in our nation revolves around pharmacological interventions; however, it is worth noting that these drug treatments are associated with certain adverse effects. In the long term, there is a significant fluctuation in blood pressure following discontinuation. There is an urgent need for an improvement to be made regarding this particular phenomenon. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of aerobic exercise on stress levels, quality of life, and lipid and glucose metabolism among hypertensive adults. A total of 92 individuals diagnosed with hypertension were assigned to two groups: a control group consisting of 46 participants, and a study group also consisting of 46 participants. The allocation of individuals to each group was determined based on digital criteria. Both cohorts were administered a regimen of pharmaceutical compounds, with the experimental group additionally engaging in aerobic exercise as an adjunctive intervention. The researcher employed the Self-Assessment Scale (SAS) to assess levels of anxiety, and the Health Questionnaire (MOSSF36) to evaluate the quality of life in both experimental groups prior to and following a 10-week intervention period. In the present study, we compared the levels of total fat (TC), triacylglycerol (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), fasting blood glucose (FPG), and insulin (FINS) in addition to insulin sensitivity index (ISI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the two groups. Following the intervention, the study group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in SAS scores compared to both the pretreatment and control groups (P<0.05). Additionally, both the pretreatment and control groups demonstrated elevated levels of cardiac (RE) and mental health (MH) roles. The study group exhibited higher scores in physical health (PH), general health (GH), vitality (VT), role emotional (RE), and mental health (MH) compared to the control group after treatment (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference observed between the two groups in terms of physical pain (BP) and social functioning (SF) (p > 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences observed between the before and after treatment groups (P>0.05) in terms of LDL-C, FINS, FPG, SBP, and MP. The results of the study indicate that the observed values of HDL-C and ISI in the study group were significantly higher than those in the control group after treatment (P<0.05). Additionally, it was found that the values of HDL-C and ISI in the study group were also higher after treatment compared to their own values before treatment (P<0.05). Hypertensive diseases can be attributed to elevated hormone levels, increased blood lipid concentrations, and reduced nitric oxide levels within the body. The phenomenon is attributed to underlying factors of a lesser magnitude. Aerobic exercise interventions of extended duration have been shown to have a positive impact on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in individuals diagnosed with hypertension. The reduction in blood lipids and plasma endothelin levels leads to improved blood glucose regulation and enhanced nitric oxide -mediated vasodilation, thereby contributing to the maintenance of stable blood pressure levels within the body. Aerobic exercise has been found to have a beneficial impact on stress levels, quality of life, and blood lipid profiles. The voluntary enhancement of blood glucose and blood pressure has been observed in elderly individuals with hypertension.",NA,wos,Psychology,Diversified health education; Aerobic exercise; hypertension; Healthy behaviour; Psychological pressure,URI::(https://www.doi.org/NA)
"Effect of Different Gas-Stunning Conditions on Heme Pigment Solutions and on the Color of Blood, Meat, and Small Intestine of Rabbits",Not mental health,"Alam, MS; Song, DH; Lee, JA; Hoa, VB; Kim, HW; Kang, SM; Cho, SH; Hwang, I; Seol, KH",ANIMALS,2022,"Simple Summary Ensuring animal welfare and customer satisfaction are crucial concerns in the modern slaughterhouse. Addressing animal welfare includes avoiding or minimizing pre-slaughter stress as well as anxiety, pain, distress, and suffering at the time of slaughter. In general, different methods of gas stunning are used, but the conventional carbon dioxide (CO2) gas-stunning method can result in severe aversion, elevated respiratory distress, irritation of the nasal mucous membranes, hypercapnia, and lactic acidosis. To reduce these problems, sometimes inert gases (argon or nitrogen) are mixed with CO2 in different proportions. In stunning, it is a vital point that after the onset of unconsciousness, the animal never recovers consciousness. On the other hand, consumers prefer bright red-colored fresh meat. This demands consideration during the stunning and slaughtering of animals. However, different high-concentration levels of inert gases and their effects on stunning are still unknown. To support this, a trial was conducted on heme-pigment solutions (hemoglobin and myoglobin solution) in different high-concentration (80%, 85%, and 90%) levels of CO2, Ar, and N-2 gas. In both cases, dark red-colored (high redness and low lightness, yellowness) solutions were found in CO2-exposed conditions, and bright red was found with N-2 (high lightness, yellowness, and low redness). The effect of Ar was intermediate between CO2- and N-2-treated groups. These results and concepts were applied to a rabbit-stunning method. It was proven that the rabbit started the onset of unconsciousness at a 96% concentration of N-2 gas; thus, 96% N-2 and 98% N-2 were considered in the nitrogen-treated group. In addition, from every treatment group, 80% concentration levels were omitted. As per the results, dark red-colored blood, meat, and small intestine (high redness and low lightness, yellowness) were seen in CO2- and Ar-stunned rabbits, and a bright red color was found in N-2-stunned rabbits (high lightness, yellowness, and low redness). However, consumers prefer to purchase bright red-colored fresh meat, so N-2 stunning can help to satisfy their desire. Out of the two treatments, with N-2, in view of the time required for stunning and color attributes, 98% N-2 is better for rabbits. Therefore, 98% N-2 can be considered a better option for gas stunning. The objectives of this study were to elucidate the effect of different high-concentration levels of inert gases (Ar and N-2) on heme-pigment solutions and on the color of the blood, meat, and small intestine of rabbits; and to figure out the proper concentration level of inert gas (Ar or N-2) for the complete stunning of the rabbit. To observe the changing of color attributes, a research study was conducted in the abattoir of the National Institute of Animal Science (NIAS), RDA, Republic of Korea. This experiment had 2 parts, (i) A trial on heme-pigment solutions (hemoglobin and myoglobin solution) was conducted in a gas chamber with different high-concentration levels of carbon dioxide, argon, nitrogen, and normal air; and (ii) a rabbit experiment was conducted-stunning with different high-concentration levels of carbon dioxide, argon, nitrogen, and the Halal method (non-stunning). A small-size digital gas chamber was used for this experiment (size: width 850 mm x depth 1350 mm). Artificial hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) solutions were created from porcine hemoglobin lyophilized powder and equine skeletal muscle myoglobin lyophilized powder, respectively. In the heme-pigment solutions trial, 10 treatments were used: (i) 80% carbon dioxide (T1), (ii) 85% carbon dioxide (T2), (iii) 90% carbon dioxide (T3), (iv) 80% argon (T4), (v) 85% argon (T5), (vi) 90% argon (T6), (vii) 80% nitogen (T7), (viii) 85% nitogen (T8), (ix) 90% nitogen (T9), and (x) normal air (T10). Heme-pigment solutions (both Hb and Mb) were exposed with each treatment for four separate durations of time (30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 4 min); and every sample (Hb and Mb) was exposed during each duration of time for 10 times (n = 10). In the rabbit experiment, seven treatments were used (i) 85% carbon dioxide (T1), (ii) 90% carbon dioxide (T2), (iii) 85% argon (T3), (iv) 90% argon (T4), (v) 96% nitrogen (T5), (vi) 98% nitogen (T6), and (vii) the Halal method (non-stunning) (T7). Forty-two rabbits (mixed-breed) were collected from the nearest commercial farm and randomly selected for a treatment group (n = 6). The average body weight was 2.3 kg. For stunning, each individual rabbit was separately kept in a gas chamber, after which each specific gas was used to fulfill the desired level in the pit. After reaching the desired level of concentration, rabbits were stunned within a very short time. It was observed that the time required for stunning in the T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 treatment was 79-82, 68-73, 97-103, 88-91, 164-173, and 108-115 s, respectively. In the case of the Halal method (non-stunning), as per the rules of Islam, rabbits were slaughtered without stunning. After slaughtering, in all treatments, the blood, meat, and small intestine of each animal were collected carefully and kept in a cool room in which the temperature was -2 degrees C, and after 24 h, the color attributes-lightness (L*), redness (a*), and yellowness (b*)-were measured via a Chroma Meter. It was found that in both experiments (trial on heme-pigment solutions and rabbit stunning), the color values (L*, a* and b*) showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) among the treatment groups. The CO2-treated groups showed high redness (a*) and low lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*), which indicated a dark-red color, and N-2-treated groups showed high lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) and low redness (a*), which implied a bright-red color. The effect of the Ar was in between the CO2- and N-2-treated groups. These phenomena were observed both in the heme-pigment solutions (Hb and Mb) and in the blood, meat, and small intestine of the rabbits. N-2-stunned animals fulfill the fundamental desire of consumers to purchase bright red-colored fresh meat. Therefore, in view of color attributes, consumer satisfaction, and animal welfare, N-2 gas can be thought of as a valuable alternative to stunning. Considering the time required for complete stunning and desirable color attributes, a 98% concentration of N-2 is best for rabbit stunning. As such, it could be used as a better option for the gas stunning of animals.",10.3390/ani12223155,wos,Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,rabbit; inert gases; heme-pigment solutions; carbon-dioxide stunning; halal method,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3390/ani12223155)

Effect of Gaze Stability Exercises on Chronic Motion Sensitivity: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Gaikwad, SB; Johnson, EG; Nelson, TC; Ambode, OI; Albalwi, AA; Alharbi, AA; Daher, NS",JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGIC PHYSICAL THERAPY,2018,"Background and Purpose: Motion sensitivity is a common condition among the general population and may be accompanied by postural instability and anxiety. Preliminary studies suggest that minimal dosage of gaze stability exercises improves postural stability in young adults with chronic motion sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of progressive gaze stability exercises on postural stability, motion sensitivity, and anxiety in healthy young adults with chronic motion sensitivity. Methods: We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of gaze stability exercises on chronic motion sensitivity. Forty-one participants of both genders ages 20 to 40 years with chronic motion sensitivity were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The intervention group performed gaze stability exercises while the sham group performed saccadic eye movement exercises for 6 weeks. Computerized Dynamic Posturography with Immersion Virtual Reality (CDP-IVR)condition 1 (C1) and condition 2 (C2)Motion Sensitivity Quotient (MSQ), Motion Sickness Sensitivity Susceptibility Questionnaire Short Form (MSSQ-Short: MSA, MSB), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI Form Y-2) were the outcome measures used. Results: There was no significant group x time interaction for MSA, MSB, MSSQ percentile, STAI, MSQ, C1 mean, or C2 mean. However, posttreatment a significant difference in the mean CDP-IVR score of C2 was identified between the 2 groups. For C2, the intervention group demonstrated a 117% increase in the mean CDP-IVR score compared with a 35.2% increase in the sham group. MSQ reduced significantly from baseline to 6 weeks postintervention in the intervention group (4.0 1.2 vs 1.9 0.9). Anxiety was significantly reduced in the sham group only (38.2 +/- 1.9 vs 35.8 +/- 2.2). Discussion and Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, progressive gaze stability exercises appear to have value for managing chronic motion sensitivity in healthy young adults. Further research with larger sample size and broader age range is needed to generalize these findings.

Effect of a Computerized Brain Exercise Program on Cognitive Performance in Older Adults,Not Multi User,"Miller, KJ; Dye, RV; Kim, J; Jennings, JL; O'Toole, E; Wong, J; Siddarth, P",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY,2013,"Objectives: Research indicates an association between stimulating mental activities and better memory performance as people age, but studies on computerized mental stimulation programs are limited. We explored whether computerized brain training exercises improved cognitive performance in older adults. Methods: In local retirement communities, a convenience sample was randomized into an intervention group (N = 36), who used a computer program 5 days a week for 20-25 minutes each day, or a wait-list control group (N = 33). All were older adults without dementia (mean age: 81.8 years; SD: 61; 67% female). Neuropsychological testing was completed at baseline (Time 1), 2 months (Time 2), and 6 months (Time 3). Three cognitive domains (Immediate Memoiy, Delayed Memoiy, Language) were compared in the two groups as a function of time using mixed models. Results: The intervention group used the computerized program (Brain Fitness, Dakim Inc., Santa Monica, CA) for an average of 43 (SD: 44) sessions by Time 2 and 81 (SD: 37.5) sessions by Time 3. Mixed models examining cognitive domains as function of time revealed significant group differences in Delayed Memoiy (F(2,72) = 47, p = 0.01) but not Immediate Memoiy and Language; no significant improvements were noted for the control group.

FindingsIn 2 randomized clinical trials conducted separately in SAo Paulo, Brazil (880 participants), and Lima, Peru (432 participants), a significantly greater proportion of participants who received the digital intervention, compared with enhanced usual care, experienced at least a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms at 3 months (40.7% vs 28.6% in Brazil; [odds ratio, 1.6]; 52.7% vs 34.1% in Peru [odds ratio, 2.1]), although the differences were no longer statistically significant at 6 months. MeaningA digital intervention for patients with depressive symptoms and comorbid hypertension or diabetes significantly improved depressive symptoms at 3 months compared with enhanced usual care in Peru and Brazil, but the effects were not sustained at 6 months in either of the 2 trials. ImportanceDepression is a leading contributor to disease burden globally. Digital mental health interventions can address the treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries, but the effectiveness in these countries is unknown. ObjectiveTo investigate the effectiveness of a digital intervention in reducing depressive symptoms among people with diabetes and/or hypertension. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsParticipants with clinically significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score >= 10) who were being treated for hypertension and/or diabetes were enrolled in a cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) at 20 sites in SAo Paulo, Brazil (N=880; from September 2016 to September 2017; final follow-up, April 2018), and in an individual-level RCT at 7 sites in Lima, Peru (N=432; from January 2017 to September 2017; final follow-up, March 2018). InterventionsAn 18-session, low-intensity, digital intervention was delivered over 6 weeks via a provided smartphone, based on behavioral activation principles, and supported by nurse assistants (n=440 participants in 10 clusters in SAo Paulo; n=217 participants in Lima) vs enhanced usual care (n=440 participants in 10 clusters in SAo Paulo; n=215 participants in Lima). Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was a reduction of at least 50% from baseline in PHQ-9 scores (range, 0-27; higher score indicates more severe depression) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included a reduction of at least 50% from baseline PHQ-9 scores at 6 months. ResultsAmong 880 patients cluster randomized in Brazil (mean age, 56.0 years; 761 [86.5%] women) and 432 patients individually randomized in Peru (mean age, 59.7 years; 352 [81.5%] women), 807 (91.7%) in Brazil and 426 (98.6%) in Peru completed at least 1 follow-up assessment. The proportion of participants in SAo Paulo with a reduction in PHQ-9 score of at least 50% at 3-month follow-up was 40.7% (159/391 participants) in the digital intervention group vs 28.6% (114/399 participants) in the enhanced usual care group (difference, 12.1 percentage points [95% CI, 5.5 to 18.7]; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2]; P=.001). In Lima, the proportion of participants with a reduction in PHQ-9 score of at least 50% at 3-month follow-up was 52.7% (108/205 participants) in the digital intervention group vs 34.1% (70/205 participants) in the enhanced usual care group (difference, 18.6 percentage points [95% CI, 9.1 to 28.0]; adjusted OR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2]; P<.001).

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of an interactive mHealth program supported by a health-social partnership team on quality of life (QOL) among community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a 3-group, randomized clinical trial conducted in 5 community centers in Hong Kong from December 1, 2020, to April 30, 2022, with a last follow-up date of January 31, 2022. Participants included older adults aged at least 60 years who were living within the service area, used a smartphone, and had at least 1 of the following problems: chronic pain, hypertension, or diabetes. Data were analyzed from May 1 to 10, 2022. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to the mHealth with interactivity (mHealth+l) group, mHealth group, or control group. Participants in the mHealth+l group received the mHealth app and nurse case management supported by a health-social partnership team. The mHealth group received the mHealth app only. The control group received no mHealth app or health-social care services. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the change in QOL from baseline to 3 months after completion of the intervention. RESULTS Among 221 participants (mean [SD] age 76.6 [8.0] years; 185 [83.7%] women), 76 were randomized to the control group, 71 were randomized to the mHealth group, and 74 were randomized to the mHealth+l group. The most common chronic diseases or problems were hypertension (147 participants [66.5%]). pain (144 participants [65.2%]). cataracts (72 participants [32.6%]), and diabetes (61 participants [27.6%]). At 3 months after the intervention and compared with the intervention group, there were no statistically significant differences in either the physical component summary (mHealth+l: beta = -1.01 [95% CI, -4.13 to 2.11]; P = .53; mHealth: beta = 0.22 [95% CI, -3.07 to 3.50]; P = .90) or the mental component summary (mHealth+1: beta = -0.87 [95% CI, -4.42 to 2.69]; P = .63; mHealth: beta = 1.73 [95% CI, -1.89 to 5.34]; P = .35) QOL scores.

Effect of a Mobile Training Application on Psychological Distress of Family Caregivers of Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,Not Multi User,"Bahadori, M; Abolhassani, S; Sami, R; Atashi, V",ARCHIVES OF REHABILITATION,2023,"Objective Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one of the most common causes of death in the world, which affects the functional level of patients due to its progressive nature. disabilities caused by the disease lead to the dependence of these patients on family caregivers. Following the changes in caregivers' lives, most family caregivers are exposed to psychological distress. Involving caregivers in pulmonary rehabilitation training for patients is one of the ways to reduce psychological distress. Considering the emergence of the digital age and the limitations of face-to-face training such as time and cost, mobile phone-based applications are available as one of the new methods for providing educational support to caregivers. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of determining the effect of the pulmonary rehabilitation application on the psychological distress of caregivers of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Materials & Methods This study is a field trial conducted on 70 family caregivers of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The samples were selected as available from the Sun Breathing Comprehensive Clinic and after checking the inclusion criteria, they were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups by minimization software. The intervention group used mobile phone-based pulmonary rehabilitation training application for 6 weeks. For the control group, face-to-face pulmonary rehabilitation training (routine) was provided in the form of 12 sessions during 6 weeks. The data collection tool included Kessler's demographic information and psychological distress questionnaires, which were completed by caregivers before and after the intervention. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 24 software and Mann-Whitney, Chi-square and independent and paired t tests.Results According to the findings, the two groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic characteristics. The average age of caregivers in the intervention and control groups was (44.1 & PLUSMN;14.8), (47.7 & PLUSMN;13.8) years, respectively. In the intervention group, 71.4% were female caregivers and in the control group, 82.9% were female caregivers (P>0/05). Before the intervention, there was no significant difference in terms of psychological distress between the test and control groups (P<0.05), but after the intervention, there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of psychological distress (P=0.001). The average score of psychological distress before and after the intervention in the intervention group was (14.97 & PLUSMN;6.65) and (10.25 & PLUSMN;4.50) respectively, and there was a significant decrease (P<0.000), but the psychological distress in the control group was (15.68 & PLUSMN;7.91). 5.42 & PLUSMN;14.60) had no significant change (P<0.05).Conclusion The results of this study indicate that training through a mobile-based pulmonary rehabilitation application may be useful in reducing the psychological distress of family caregivers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Therefore, since the favorable mental state of caregivers has a significant effect on the quality of care provided , it is recommended to use this method in the training of caregivers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",10.32598/RJ.24.2.3313.2,wos,Rehabilitation,Web-based Intervention; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Psychological distress; Caregivers,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.32598/RJ.24.2.3313.2)

Follow-up surveys were completed between June 29 and November 11, 2021. INTERVENTIONS All participants received 11 weekly cooking videos and associated home-delivered groceries. The intervention group also received 12 weekly, 30-minute virtual health coach sessions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the validated 6-item (range, 6-30) Family Healthy Lifestyle Subscale (FHLS) scores. The secondary outcome was the validated 6-item (range, 0-6) Family Resilience and Connection Index (FRCI) scores. Outcomes were determined a priori and evaluated at baseline and 12-week follow-up. A priori independent t tests and multivariable tobit regression models assessed intervention effects, and post hoc, secondary interaction models assessed whether effects differed over baseline outcomes. RESULTS Among the 123 enrolled families, 110 (89%) were included in the primary analyses (parent mean [SD] age, 35.1 [8.2] years; 104 [95%] female; 55 [50%] non-Hispanic Black; child mean [SD] age, 5.2 [1.7] years; 62 [56%] male).

Importance The number of patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) for psychiatric care continues to increase. Psychiatrists often make a conservative recommendation to admit patients because robust outpatient services for close follow-up are lacking. Objective To assess whether the availability of a 45-day behavioral health-virtual patient navigation program decreases hospitalization among patients presenting to the ED with a behavioral health crisis or need. Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized clinical trial enrolled 637 patients who presented to 6 EDs spanning urban and suburban locations within a large integrated health care system in North Carolina from June 12, 2017, through February 14, 2018; patients were followed up for up to 45 days. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with a behavioral health crisis and a completed telepsychiatric ED consultation. The availability of the behavioral health-virtual patient navigation intervention was randomly allocated to specific days (Monday through Friday from 7 am to 7 pm) so that, in a 2-week block, there were 5 intervention days and 5 usual care days; 323 patients presented on days when the program was offered, and 314 presented on usual care days. Data analysis was performed from March 7 through June 13, 2018, using an intention-to-treat approach. Interventions The behavioral health-virtual patient navigation program included video contact with a patient while in the ED and telephonic outreach 24 to 72 hours after discharge and then at least weekly for up to 45 days. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the conversion of an ED encounter to hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included 45-day follow-up encounters with a self-harm diagnosis and postdischarge acute care use. Results Among 637 participants, 358 (56.2%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 39.7 (16.6) years. The conversion rates were 55.1% (178 of 323) in the intervention group vs 63.1% (198 of 314) in the usual care group (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.54-1.02; P = .06).

Contact-based educational (CBE) interventions have been shown to reduce this public stigma. Objective: We investigated the ability of our Virtual Reality Antistigma (VRAS) app developed for CBE interventions to reduce the stigma of depression. Methods: Sixteen medical students were recruited and randomized 1:1 to the intervention group, who used the VRAS app (VRAS group), and the control group, who watched a video on depression. The depression stigma score was assessed using the Depression Stigma Scale (DSS) and Attitudinal Social Distance (ASD) questionnaire at pre- and postintervention. Feasibility was assessed in both groups and usability was assessed only in the VRAS group after the intervention. A qualitative study was performed on the acquisition of knowledge about stigma in both groups based on participants' answers to open-ended questions and interviews after the intervention. Results: The feasibility score was significantly higher in the VRAS group (mean 5.63, SD 0.74) than in the control group (mean 3.88, SD 1.73; P=.03). However, no significant differences were apparent between the VRAS and control groups for the DSS (VRAS: mean 35.13, SD 5.30; control: mean 35.38, SD 4.50; P=.92) or ASD (VRAS: mean 12.25, SD 3.33; control: mean 11.25, SD 1.91; P=.92).

Effect of a Virtual Reality Environment Using a Domed Ceiling Screen on Procedural Pain During Intravenous Placement in Young Children A Randomized Clinical Trial,Not Multi User,"Lee, HN; Park, JW; Hwang, S; Jung, JY; Kim, D; Kwak, YH; Lee, EJ",JAMA PEDIATRICS,2023,"IMPORTANCE Distraction using virtual reality (VR) has been found to provide a clinically significant reduction in the experience of pain during various painful procedures. Commercially available VR systems usually require the user to wear a head-mounted display helmet, which can be challenging for young children, and whether VR can reduce pain during intravenous (IV) placement in young children is currently unknown. OBJECTIVE To determine whether a VR environment using a novel domed ceiling screen reduces distress among children over the course of IV placement compared with standard care in a pediatric emergency department. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted from June 3, 2020, to February 8, 2021, at an urban tertiary academic children's hospital. Included were children aged 6 months to 4 years undergoing IV placement in the pediatric emergency department. INTERVENTION Children in the intervention group lay on a bed to experience a VR animation using a domed ceiling screen during the IV placement procedure, which was performed as usual. Children in the control group also lay on a bed during the procedure but did not view a VR animation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was pain scores measured using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale at 4 time points during IV placement: immediately after the child lay down on the bed (T1), the moment the tourniquet was applied (T2), the moment a sterile alcohol swab was applied (T3), and the moment the needle penetrated the skin (T4). RESULTS Of the 88 children included in the final analysis, 44 received VR distraction (median [IQR] age, 24.0 [14.5-44.0] months; 27 boys [61.4%]), and 44 received standard care (median [IQR] age, 23.0 [15.0-40.0] months; 26 boys [59.1%]). The median [IQR] FLACC scores at T4 were 6.0 (1.8-7.5) in the intervention group and 7.0 (5.5-7.8) in the control group. The ordinal logistic regression model showed that children in the VR intervention group vs the control group had a lower probability of higher FLACC scores (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-0.99; P = .046).

However, only a few effective mental health interventions exist for this vulnerable population. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a WeChat-based intervention, Run4Love, with a randomized controlled trial among 300 people living with HIV and depression (PLWHD) in China. Methods: We recruited PLWH from the HIV outpatient clinic in South China Participants were screened based on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Those who scored 16 or higher were eligible to participate. A total of 300 eligible patients were enrolled. After obtaining informed consent from the participants, completion of a baseline survey, and collection of participants' hair samples for measuring cortisol, the participants were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group received the Run4Love program, delivered via the popular social media app WeChat. Cognitive behavioral stress management courses and weekly reminders of exercise were delivered in a multimedia format. Participants' progress was monitored with timely and tailored feedback. The control group received usual care and a brochure on nutrition for PLWH. Data were collected at 3, 6, and 9 months. The primary outcome was depression, which was measured by a validated instrument. Results: Participants in the intervention and control groups were comparable at baseline; about 91.3% (139/150), 88.3% (132/150), and 86.7% (130/150) participants completed the 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-ups, respectively.

A further rise in the OA incidence is expected, generating increased demand of care potentially challenging accessibility and threatening to overwhelm the healthcare system. Innovative solutions that may improve accessibility to recommended OA care for patients in primary care and maintain healthcare sustainability are warranted. Digitalising home exercise therapy may be one such solution. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile health app providing digitalised home exercises, compared with supervised exercise therapy in patients with OA. Second, we will evaluate the cost-efficiency of the intervention and explore potential differences in outcome and adherence to exercises in the experimental treatment group. Methods and analysis A two-armed non-inferiority randomised controlled trial will be conducted. In total, 156 patients with hip and/or knee OA will be recruited from physiotherapy clinics in primary care in Norway.

Measures will be collected telephonically by a team of psychologists at baseline and immediately after the 2 weeks intervention period. Measures will include stress, depression and anxiety (DASS-21 questionnaire-primary endpoint), insomnia (ISI), burnout (MBI-HSS), post-traumatic stress disorder (DTS), and self-efficacy (GSE). The study was funded in May 2020, and was ethically approved in June 2020. Trial participants, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to group allocation. Discussion Despite the increasing use of mobile health interventions to deliver mental health care, this area of research is still on its infancy. This study will help increase the scientific evidence about the effectiveness of this type of intervention on this specific population and context. Impact Despite the lack of solid evidence about their effectiveness, mobile-based health interventions are already being widely implemented because of their low cost and high scalability. The findings from this study will help health services and organizations to make informed decisions in relation to the development and implementation of this type of interventions, allowing them pondering not only their attractive implementability features, but also empirical data about its benefits.

Effect of a musical intervention on tolerance and efficacy of non-invasive ventilation in the ICU: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (MUSique pour l'Insuffisance Respiratoire Aigue - Mus-IRA),Not Multi User,"Messika, J; Hajage, D; Panneckoucke, N; Villard, S; Martin, Y; Renard, E; Blivet, A; Reignier, J; Maquigneau, N; Stoclin, A; Puechberty, C; Guétin, S; Dechanet, A; Fauquembergue, A; Gaudry, S; Dreyfuss, D; Ricard, JD",TRIALS,2016,"Background: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) tolerance is a key factor of NIV success. Hence, numerous sedative pharmacological or non-pharmacological strategies have been assessed to improve NIV tolerance. Music therapy in various health care settings has shown beneficial effects. In invasively ventilated critical care patients, encouraging results of music therapy on physiological parameters, anxiety, and agitation have been reported. We hypothesize that a musical intervention improves NIV tolerance in comparison to conventional care. We therefore question the potential benefit of a receptive music session administered to patients by trained caregivers (musical intervention) to enhance acceptance and tolerance of NIV. Methods/design: We conduct a prospective, three-center, open-label, three-arm randomized trial involving patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who require NIV, as assessed by the treating physician. Participants are allocated to a musical intervention arm (musical intervention applied during all NIV sessions), to a sensory deprivation arm (sight and hearing isolation during all NIV sessions), or to the control group. The primary endpoint is the change in respiratory comfort (measured with a digital visual scale) before the initiation and after 30 minutes of the first NIV session. The evaluation of the primary endpoint is performed blindly from the treatment group. Secondary endpoints include changes in respiratory and cardiovascular parameters during NIV sessions, the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation, day-90 anxiety/depression and health-related quality of life, post-trauma stress induced by NIV, and the overall assessment of NIV. The follow-up for each participant is 90 days. We expect to randomize a total of 99 participants. Discussion: As music intervention is a simple and easy-to-implement non-pharmacological technique, efficacious in reducing anxiety in critically ill patients, it appeared logical to assess its efficacy in NIV, one of the most stressful techniques used in the ICU. Patient centeredness was crucial in choosing the outcomes assessed.",10.1186/s13063-016-1574-z,"pubmed, wos",Research & Experimental Medicine,Non-invasive ventilation; Critical care; Music intervention; Respiratory comfort,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-016-1574-z)

Study design This randomised controlled trial examined individual-level abortion stigma and psychological distress among patients undergoing outpatient abortion. Patients were randomised to a narrative intervention verus usual care. The intervention consisted of viewing a digital narrative and responding to a writing prompt. Abortion stigma was measured using the Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS) and psychological distress was assessed with a modified Profile of Mood States-Short Form (POMS-SF) at baseline and after 2 weeks. The primary outcome compared change in ILAS score from baseline to follow-up between groups. The secondary outcome compared change in the modified POMS-SF score. Results We randomised 215 participants. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Overall baseline stigma scores were low. The study groups did not differ significantly in the primary ILAS outcome (mean change=0.07 in both groups with score range 0 to 3.5, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.11, p=0.98). There was also no significant difference in the secondary modified POMS-SF outcome (mean change -0.64 for the intervention group and -0.65 for the control group with score range -8 to 8, 95% CI -1.10 to 1.12, p=0.98).

Effect of an internet- and app-based stress intervention compared to online psychoeducation in university students with depressive symptoms: Results of a randomized controlled trial*,Population,"Harrer, M; Apolinário-Hagen, J; Fritsche, L; Salewski, C; Zarski, AC; Lehr, D; Baumeister, H; Cuijpers, P; Ebert, DD",INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH,2021,"Depression is highly prevalent among university students. Internet-based interventions have been found to be effective in addressing depressive symptoms, but it is open if this also applies to interventions directed at academic stress. It is also largely unclear if the techniques employed in such programs provide significant additional benefits when controlling for non-specific intervention effects. A sample of N = 200 students with elevated levels of depression (CES-D ? 16) of a large distance-learning university were randomly assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress intervention group (IG; n = 100) or an active control group (CG; n = 100) receiving an Internet-based psychoeducational program of equal length. Self-report data was assessed at baseline, post-treatment (7 weeks) and three-month follow-up. The primary outcome was depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk factors, and academic outcomes. We found significant between-group effects on depressive symptom severity (d = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.08?0.64), as well as behavioral activation (d = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.30?0.91), perceived stress (d = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18?0.73), anxiety (d = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.03?0.67) and other secondary outcomes post-treatment. Effects on depression were sustained at three-month follow-up. Response rates for depressive symptoms were significantly higher in the IG (26%) than the CG (14%) at post-test (?2=4.5, p = 0.04), but not at three-month follow-up (p = 0.454). We also found significant effects on relevant academic outcomes, including work impairment (follow-up; d = 0.36), work output (post-treatment; d = 0.27) and work cutback (follow-up; d = 0.36). The intervention was more effective for depressive symptoms compared to the CG, and so controlling for unspecific intervention effects. This suggests that specific techniques of the intervention may provide significant additional benefits on depressive symptoms.

Method and Materials: Forty-nine healthy, cooperative children with bilateral carious molars requiring treatment under local anesthesia were recruited in this crossover study. Treatments were done in two visits, 1 to 4 weeks apart. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups according to the sequence of AV eyeglasses used. Group I received the injection without wearing AV eyeglasses in the first visit and then wearing AV eyeglasses in a second visit. Group II was vice versa. Self-reporting pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R), face, legs, activity, crying, and consolability scale (FLACC), and heart rate (HR), were measured to assess the injection pain. Results: No significant differences in sex (P = .132) and treatment arch (P = .779) were observed between the two groups using a chi-square test at P < .05. There were no significant differences in age (P = .341, t test at P <= .05) and previous dental experience (P = .19, Fisher's exact test at P <= .05) between the two groups.

However, research in such interventions delivered online is scarce. We evaluated the effectiveness of a digital multicomponent intervention-COPe-support-in improving carers' mental wellbeing and caregiving-related outcomes. Methods In this two-arm, individually randomised, superiority trial, people aged 18 years or older who provided at least weekly support in any format for a relative or close friend affected by psychosis across England were randomly assigned (1:1) to either COPe-support or a passive online information resource using an independent online system. Participants were recruited through 30 mental health UK National Health Service trusts. The study team were masked to allocation and assessment of outcomes as all data collection took place online. Participants had access to either condition for 40 weeks and were advised to spend at least half an hour per week over the initial 20 weeks to go through materials at their own pace and to allow time to integrate knowledge and skills learned into practice. It was not feasible to mask participants or the online facilitator to intervention allocation. COPe-support provided psychoeducation on psychosis-related caregiving strategies and forums with professionals and other carers, and the control intervention comprised a passive online information resource. The primary outcome at 20 weeks was mental wellbeing measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS; minimally clinically important difference [MCID] 3). This trial is registered with ISRCTN, 89563420. Findings Between March 1, 2018, and Feb 14, 2020, 407 participants were randomly assigned, with 204 allocated to COPe-support and 203 allocated to control. The participants (mean age 53.1 years, SD 13.2) were mostly female (330 [81%] of 407 participants) and White (359 [88%] of 407 participants). 346 (85%) of 407 participants provided primary endpoint data, 174 (85%) of 204 participants in the COPe-support group and 172 (85%) of 203 participants in the control group. The mean WEMWBS score at 20 weeks was 44.5 (SD 8.31) for the COPe-support group and 43.3 (9.19) for the control group. We found no evidence of a difference in wellbeing between the two groups (adjusted mean difference 0.37, 95% CI -1.14 to 1.88; p=0.63). In the COPe-support group, 106 (52%) of 204 participants met the complier definition of a minimum of two logins in separate weeks. The complier average causal effect analysis increased the difference in WEMWBS scores (adjusted difference 0.83, 95% CI -1.45 to 3.11; p=0.47), but this was lower than the MCID. There were no adverse events. Interpretation Our findings did not support the use of COPe-support over a passive online information resource. However, further research to optimise digital interventions adjunctive to face-to-face support for carers remains important. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Unfortunately, it is often hard for distressed individuals to access mental health services under conditions of restricted movement or even lockdown. Objective: The study first aims to develop an online digital intervention package based on a commercially released coloring game. The second aim is to test the effectiveness of difference intervention packages for players to increase subjective well-being (SWB) and reduce anxiety during the pandemic. Methods: An evidence-based coloring intervention package was developed and uploaded to an online coloring game covering almost 1.5 million players worldwide in January 2021. Players worldwide participated to color either 4 rounds of images characterized by awe, pink, nature, and blue or 4 rounds of irrelevant images. Participants' SWB and anxiety and the perceived effectiveness of the game in reducing anxiety (subjective effectiveness [SE]) were assessed 1 week before the intervention (T1), after the participants completed pictures in each round (T2-T5), and after the intervention (T6). Independent 2-tailed t tests were conducted to examine the general intervention (GI) effect and the intervention effect of each round. Univariate analysis was used to examine whether these outcome variables were influenced by the number of rounds completed. Results: In total, 1390 players worldwide responded and completed at least 1 assessment. Overall, the GI group showed a statistical significantly greater increase in SWB than the general control (GC) group (N=164, t162=3.59, Cohen d=0.59, 95% CI 0.36-1.24, P<.001). Compared to the control group, the best effectiveness of the intervention group was seen in the awe round, in which the increase in SWB was significant (N=171, t169=2.51, Cohen d=0.39, 95% CI 0.10-0.82, P=.01), and players who colored all 4 pictures had nearly significant improvements in SWB (N=171, F4,170=2.34, partial.2=0.053, P=.06) and a significant decrease in anxiety (N=171, F4,170=3.39, partial.2=0.075, P=.01).

Effect of the Digital Education Package (DEP) on prevention of anxiety in hospitalized children: a quasi-experimental study,Not Multi User,"Zamani, M; Sigaroudi, AE; Pouralizadeh, M; Kazemnejad-Leili, E",BMC NURSING,2022,"Background Hospitalization of children is a stressful event. However, the child's education at the time of hospital admission can be effective for the prevention of their anxiety via the use of more attractive methods. The study's aim was to assess the effectiveness of the education using a digital education package on the level of anxiety of hospitalized children. Methods This is a quasi-experimental study with the randomized block method. The sample size was calculated based on Shahrabadi et al.'s study and sixty eligible hospitalized children were allocated to the two study groups from June 2019 to December 2020, in Hefdah-e-Sahrivar hospital which is the central pediatric hospital in Rasht city. The intervention was education using a digital package that was done 15 min after the hospitalization of the children. Pediatrics' Spielberger's anxiety Inventory was used for measuring the participants' anxiety before and after the intervention. We used Chi square test, Fisher exact test and paired t-test to analyze data. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results In the post-intervention phase, total mean scores of anxiety were significantly lower in the experimental group (60.17 +/- 6.46) rather than in the control group (72.6 +/- 8.83) (P < 0.001). The mean anxiety scores before and after the intervention were 87.43 +/- 11 vs. 60.17 +/- 6.46 in the intervention group and 81.5 +/- 11 vs. 72.6 +/- 8.83 in the control group, respectively. There were significant differences in intergroup anxiety scores between the two study groups (P < 0.001). Conclusions The current study showed that the Digital Education Package (DEP) is an effective method for reducing children's anxiety during hospitalization. Therefore, we recommended it as a preferred and simple method rather than routine education for pediatric nurses.",10.1186/s12912-022-01113-8,"pubmed, wos",Nursing,Hospital education; Anxiety; Child; Digital; Hospitalization,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12912-022-01113-8)
"Effect of transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation on the fatigue syndrome in patients with gastrointestinal cancers - FATIVA: a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study protocol",Not mental health,"Mortimer, G; Nadine, H; Nina, T; Kirsten, S; Anke, RS",PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES,2023,"BackgroundCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is defined as a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning. CRF is frequently observed in cancer patients even before the initiation of tumor therapy. Its cause is not clear, but in addition to primary effects of therapy, a tumor-induced elevated level of inflammatory cytokines may play a role. Transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a noninvasive way to activate central nervous pathways and modulate pain perception and the immune system. It has positive effects on autoimmune conditions and can also improve fatigue associated with Sjogren's syndrome. It is the main purpose of this feasibility study to investigate the feasibility of daily taVNS against CRF. Therefore, the stimulation protocol of the newly introduced smartphone app of the manufacturer is evaluated. Additionally, the effect taVNS on CRF and quality of life (QoL) shall be evaluated.MethodsThirty adult patients with gastrointestinal tumors during or after treatment, relevant CRF (Hornheide questionnaire) and life expectancy > 1 year, are enrolled. Patients are randomized to treatment or sham arm and be informed that they will either feel the stimulation or not. Treatment group will receive left-sided tragus above-threshold stimulation with 25 Hz, 250 mu s pulse width, and 28-s/32-s on/off paradigm for 4 h throughout the day for 4 weeks. Sham group will receive no stimulation via a nonfunctional electrode. A daily stimulation protocol with time and average intensity is automatically created by a smartphone app connected to the stimulator via Bluetooth (R). Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20, Short-Form 36 and Beck Depression Inventory questionnaires will be filled out before and after 4 weeks of stimulation.DiscussionPrimarily, the patients' daily stimulation time and intensity will be evaluated through the electronic protocol after 4 weeks. Secondarily, the effect of taVNS on cancer-related fatigue and QoL will be measured through the questionnaires. As taVNS seems to modulate inflammatory cytokines, this noninvasive method may - if accepted by the patients - be a promising adjunct in the treatment of cancer-related fatigue.",10.1186/s40814-023-01289-z,"pubmed, wos",Research & Experimental Medicine,Cancer-related fatigue; Vagal nerve stimulation; Cytokines,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40814-023-01289-z)
Effect of virtual group EcoMeditation on psychological conditions and flow states,Other,"Church, D; Stapleton, P; Gosatti, D; O'Keefe, T",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2022,"BackgroundA plethora of literature has delineated the therapeutic benefits of meditation practice on psychological functioning. A novel meditative practice, EcoMeditation, includes elements of four evidence-based techniques: The Quick Coherence Technique for regulating heart rate variability (HRV), Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), mindfulness, and neurofeedback. ObjectivesChanges in psychological symptoms, including anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, pain, and happiness were measured following a one-day virtual EcoMeditation training workshop. The current study extended on previous literature by adding measures of transcendent experiences and flow states. MethodsParticipants were drawn from a convenience sample of 151 participants (130 female, 21 male) aged between 26 to 71 years (M = 45.1, SD = 9.19) attending a one-day virtual EcoMeditation workshop. They were assessed pre-workshop, post-workshop, and at 3-months follow-up. ResultsPost-workshop results (N = 111) indicated a significant reduction in anxiety (-42.3%, p < 0.001), depression (-37.5%, p < 0.001), posttraumatic stress (-13.0%, p < 0.001), and pain (-63.2%, p < 0.001) Likert mean scores when compared to pre-workshop. There was also a significant increase in happiness (+111.1%, p < 0.001), flow states (+17.4%, p < 0.001), and transcendent experiences (+18.5%, p < 0.001). At 3-months follow-up, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA (N = 72) found significant decreases in anxiety, depression, and pain symptoms between pre-test and post-test, as well between pre-test and follow-up. Flow, happiness, and transcendent experiences increased significantly between pre-test and post-test, as well as between pre-test and follow-up, with over 71% of participants experiencing clinically significant improvements. Significant reductions in posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms between pre-test and follow-up were also noted. ConclusionEcoMeditation is associated with significant improvements in psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, pain, and posttraumatic stress. EcoMeditation was also shown to enhance flow states and transcendent experiences. The benefits identified were similar to those found in the existing literature and provide support for the use of EcoMeditation as an effective stress reduction method that improves psychological symptoms and enhances transcendent states.",10.3389/fpsyg.2022.907846,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,meditation; anxiety; depression; PTSD; group therapy; virtual; EcoMeditation; emotional freedom techniques,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.907846)
Effect of virtual reality and music therapy on anxiety and perioperative pain in surgical extraction of impacted third molars,Population,"De Ramón, LAS; Martínez, AFF; Carricondo, ARG; Gálvez, FE; Rodríguez, RA",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION,2023,"Background. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of virtual reality (VR) and music therapy on anxiety and perioperative pain in patients undergoing extraction of impacted third molars. Methods. A total of 275 patients who had to undergo surgery for third-molar extraction participated in a randomized controlled trial and were divided into 3 parallel groups: music therapy intervention (n = 91), VR intervention (n = 93), and control (n = 91). The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the visual analog scale of pain intensity were used as measurements in this study.Results. Patients in the music therapy and VR groups showed a greater reduction in anxiety level scores after third-molar extraction surgery (reduction in total anxiety in music group: 15.12; 95% CI, 13.16 to 17.08; Rosenthal r, 1.61; P < .001; reduction in total anxiety in VR group: 9.80; 95% CI, 7.66 to 11.95; Rosenthal r, 0.97; P < .001; reduction in total anxiety in control group: 9.80; 95% CI, 7.66 to 11.95; Rosenthal r, 0.97; P < .001). The intensity of pain after the intervention was lower in patients in the music therapy group than patients in the control group (P = .04). After the intervention, the music therapy and VR groups presented a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (P < .05), diastolic blood pressure (P < .05), and heart rate (P < .05) compared with the control group.Conclusions. These findings suggest that the use of music therapy and VR during third-molar extraction surgery reduces anxiety and improves the patient's physiological parameters.Practical Implications. Implementation of these interventions (noninvasive, nonpharmacologic, economic) in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery and dentistry could improve procedures performed under local anesthesia, improving the clinical experience of patients.

Effect of virtual reality simulation training on the response capability of public health emergency reserve nurses in China: a quasiexperimental study,Not Multi User,"Zhang, DD; Liao, HW; Jia, YT; Yang, WR; He, PP; Wang, DM; Chen, YJ; Yang, W; Zhang, YP",BMJ OPEN,2021,"Objective To develop a virtual reality simulation training programme, and further verify the effect of the programme on improving the response capacity of emergency reserve nurses confronting public health emergencies. Design A prospective quasiexperimental design with a control group. Participants A total of 120 nurses were recruited and randomly divided into the control group and the intervention group. Intervention Participants underwent a 3-month training. The control group received the conventional training of emergency response (eg, theoretical lectures, technical skills and psychological training), while the intervention group underwent the virtual reality simulation training in combination with skills training. The COVID-19 cases were incorporated into the intervention group training, and the psychological training was identical to both groups. At the end of the training, each group conducted emergency drills twice. Before and after the intervention, the two groups were assessed for the knowledge and technical skills regarding responses to fulminate respiratory infectious diseases, as well as the capacity of emergency care. Furthermore, their pandemic preparedness was assessed with a disaster preparedness questionnaire. Results After the intervention, the scores of the relevant knowledge, the capacity of emergency care and disaster preparedness in the intervention group significantly increased (p<0.01). The score of technical skills in the control group increased more significantly than that of the intervention group (p<0.01). No significant difference was identified in the scores of postdisaster management in two groups (p>0.05). Conclusion The virtual reality simulation training in combination with technical skills training can improve the response capacity of emergency reserve nurses as compared with the conventional training.

Effectiveness and Acceptance of Technology-Based Psychological Interventions for the Acute Treatment of Unipolar Depression: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,Good,"Köhnen, M; Kriston, L; Härter, M; Baumeister, H; Liebherz, S",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2021,"Background: Evidence on technology-based psychological interventions (TBIs) for the acute treatment of depression is rapidly growing. Despite extensive research in this field, there is a lack of research determining effectiveness and acceptance of TBIs considering different application formats in people with a formally diagnosed depressive disorder. Objective: The goal of the review was to investigate the effectiveness and acceptance of TBIs in people with diagnosed depression with particular focus on application formats (stand-alone interventions, blended treatments, collaborative and/or stepped care interventions). Methods: Studies investigating adults with diagnosed unipolar depressive disorders receiving any kind of psychotherapeutic treatment delivered (at least partly) by a technical medium and conducted as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. We searched CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; August 2020), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, CINAHL (January 2018), clinical trial registers, and sources of grey literature (January 2019). Two independent authors decided about study inclusion and extracted data. We performed random effects meta-analyses to synthesize the data. Results: Database searches resulted in 15,546 records of which 78 completed studies were included. TBIs delivered as stand-alone interventions showed positive effects on posttreatment depression severity when compared to treatment as usual (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.15, k=10; I-2=86%), attention placebo (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.30; k=12; I-2=66%), and waitlist controls (SMD -1.01, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.79; k=19; I-2=73%). Superior long-term effects on depression severity were shown when TBIs were compared to treatment as usual (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.07; k=6; I-2=48%) attention placebo (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.07; k=7; I-2=21%) and waitlist controls (SMD -0.74, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.18; k=3; I-2=79%). TBIs delivered as blended treatments (providing a TBI as an add-on to face-to-face treatment) yielded beneficial effects on posttreatment depression severity (SMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.05; k=8; I-2=53%) compared to face-to-face treatments only. Additionally, TBIs delivered within collaborative care trials were more effective in reducing posttreatment (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.04; k=2; I-2=0%) and long-term (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.07; k=2; I-2=0%) depression severity than usual care. Dropout rates did not differ between the intervention and control groups in any comparison (all P >=.09). Conclusions: We found that TBIs are effective not only when delivered as stand-alone interventions but also when they are delivered as blended treatments or in collaborative care trials for people with diagnosed depression.

Social anxiety is one of the most common sources of mental distress in the population, and many people with symptoms do not seek help for what represents a significant public health problem. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-guided cognitive behavioral internet intervention for people with social anxiety symptoms in the general population. Methods: We conducted a two-group randomized controlled trial in England between May 11, 2016, and June 27, 2018. Adults with social anxiety symptoms who were not receiving treatment for social anxiety were recruited using online advertisements. All participants had unrestricted access to usual care and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either a Web-based unguided self-help intervention based on cognitive behavioral principles or a waiting list control group. All outcomes were collected through self-report online questionnaires. The primary outcome was the change in 17-item Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN-17) score from baseline to 6 weeks using a linear mixed-effect model that used data from all time points (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). Results: A total of 2122 participants were randomized, and 6 were excluded from analyses because they were ineligible. Of the 2116 eligible randomized participants (mean age 37 years; 80.24%, 1698/2116 women), 70.13% (1484/2116) had follow-up data available for analysis, and 56.95% (1205/2116) had data on the primary outcome, although attrition was higher in the intervention arm. At 6 weeks, the mean (95% CI) adjusted difference in change in SPIN-17 score in the intervention group compared with control was -1.94 (-3.13 to -0.75; P=.001), a standardized mean difference effect size of 0.2. The improvement was maintained at 12 months. Given the high dropout rate, sensitivity analyses explored missing data assumptions, with results that were consistent with those of the primary analysis. The economic evaluation demonstrated cost-effectiveness with a small health status benefit and a reduction in health service utilization. Conclusions: For people with social anxiety symptoms who are not receiving other forms of help, this study suggests that the use of an online self-help tool based on cognitive behavioral principles can provide a small improvement in social anxiety symptoms compared with no intervention, although dropout rates were high.",10.2196/16804,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,randomized controlled trial; internet; self-care; social anxiety,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/16804)
Effectiveness and Minimum Effective Dose of App-Based Mobile Health Interventions for Anxiety and Depression Symptom Reduction: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Not Multi User,"Lu, SC; Xu, MY; Wang, M; Hardi, A; Cheng, AL; Chang, SH; Yen, PY",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2022,"Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps offer new opportunities to deliver psychological treatments for mental illness in an accessible, private format. The results of several previous systematic reviews support the use of app-based mHealth interventions for anxiety and depression symptom management. However, it remains unclear how much or how long the minimum treatment dose is for an mHealth intervention to be effective. Just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) has been introduced in the mHealth domain to facilitate behavior changes and is positioned to guide the design of mHealth interventions with enhanced adherence and effectiveness.Objective: Inspired by the JITAI framework, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the dose effectiveness of app-based mHealth interventions for anxiety and depression symptom reduction.Methods: We conducted a literature search on 7 databases (ie, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Scopus, Cochrane Library (eg, CENTRAL), ScienceDirect, and ClinicalTrials, for publications from January 2012 to April 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating app-based mHealth interventions for anxiety and depression. The study selection and data extraction process followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We estimated the pooled effect size using Hedge g and appraised study quality using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs.Results: We included 15 studies involving 2627 participants for 18 app-based mHealth interventions. Participants in the intervention groups showed a significant effect on anxiety (Hedge g=-.10, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.06, I2=0%) but not on depression (Hedge g=-.08, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.07, I2=4%). Interventions of at least 7 weeks' duration had larger effect sizes on anxiety symptom reduction.Conclusions: There is inconclusive evidence for clinical use of app-based mHealth interventions for anxiety and depression at the current stage due to the small to nonsignificant effects of the interventions and study quality concerns.

Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an electronic mindfulness-based intervention (eMBI) on maternal mental health during pregnancy: the mindmom study protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial,Other,"Müller, M; Matthies, LM; Goetz, M; Abele, H; Brucker, SY; Bauer, A; Graf, J; Zipfel, S; Hasemann, L; Wallwiener, M; Wallwiener, S",TRIALS,2020,"BackgroundMental disorders are common during the peripartum period and may have far-reaching consequences for both mother and child. Unfortunately, most antenatal care systems do not provide any structured screening for maternal mental health. As a consequence, mental illnesses are often overlooked and not treated adequately. If correctly diagnosed, cognitive behavioral therapy is currently the treatment of choice for mental illnesses. In addition, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) seem to represent a promising treatment option for anxiety and depression during the peripartum period. Considering the internet's increasing omnipresence, MBIs can also be offered electronically via a (tablet) computer or smartphone (electronically based MBI=eMBI).ObjectiveThe current study aims to examine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an eMBI (the mindmom application) developed by an interdisciplinary team of gynecologists, psychologists, and midwives, teaching pregnant women how to deal with stress, pregnancy-related anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The study sample consists of pregnant women in their third trimester who screened positive for emotional distress. The mindmom study is a bicentric prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is currently conducted at the University women's hospitals of Heidelberg and Tubingen, Germany.MethodsWithin the scope of the routine prenatal care, pregnant women attending routine pregnancy care in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, are invited to participate in a screening for mental distress based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Women with an EPDS screening result >9 will be referred to one of the mindmom coordinating study centers and are offered counseling either face-to-face or via videotelephony. After an initial psychological counseling, women are invited to participate in an eMBI in their last pregnancy trimester. The study will enroll N=280 study participants (N=140 per group), who are randomized 1:1 into the intervention (IG) or control group (treatment as usual=TAU).All participants are requested to complete a total of 7 digital assessments (5 visits pre- and 2 follow-up visits postpartum), involving self-report questionnaires, sociodemographic and medical data, physiological measures, and morning cortisol profiles. The primary outcome will be depressive and anxiety symptoms, measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the State Trait Anxiety Questionnaire, and the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include mindfulness, satisfaction with birth, quality of life, fetal attachment, bonding, mode of delivery, and cost-effectiveness.DiscussionThis is the first German RCT to examine the (cost-)effectiveness of an eMBI on maternal mental health during pregnancy.

Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an electronic mindfulness-based intervention to improve maternal mental health in the peripartum: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,Other,"Branjerdporn, G; Gillespie, K; Martin, E; Kissane, V; De Young, A; Ewais, T; Goldsmith, K; Wilson, S; Adhikary, S; McGahan, G; Schulz, C; Beckmann, M",TRIALS,2023,"BackgroundPerinatal women are highly vulnerable to developing mental health issues and particularly susceptible to a recurrence of psychiatric illness. Poor mental health during the perinatal period can have long-term impacts on the physical and psychiatric health of both mother and child. A potentially useful strategy to improve women's mental health is through a mobile application teaching mindfulness, an evidence-based technique helping individuals focus on the present moment.MethodsA mixed method, prospective randomised controlled trial. The study group comprise women aged 18 years and over, who are attending the public and private maternity clinics at Mater Mothers' Hospital. A sample of 360 prenatal women will be randomised into the intervention group (with the use of the mindfulness app) or usual care. Participants will remain in the study for 11 months and will be assessed at four timepoints for changes in postnatal depression, mother-infant bonding, and quality of life. A cost-effectiveness evaluation will also be conducted using quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculations. A random selection of intervention participants will be invited to attend focus groups to give feedback on the mindfulness app.DiscussionPrevious studies have found mindfulness interventions can reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances in a prenatal population. The risks of the intervention are low, but could be of significant benefit for women who are unable to attend face-to-face appointments due to geographical, financial, or time barriers; during endemic or pandemic scenarios; or due to health or mobility issues.Trial registrationThis study was approved by the Mater Misericordiae Human Research Ethics Committee (83,589).

Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of text messages with or without endowment incentives for weight management in men with obesity (Game of Stones): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,Not mental health,"Macaulay, L; O'Dolan, C; Avenell, A; Carroll, P; Cotton, S; Dombrowski, S; Elders, A; Goulao, B; Gray, C; Harris, FM; Hunt, K; Kee, F; MacLennan, G; McDonald, MD; McKinley, M; Skinner, R; Torrens, C; Tod, M; Turner, K; van der Pol, M; Hoddinott, P",TRIALS,2022,"Background: Obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, mobility problems and some cancers, and its prevalence is rising. Men engage less than women in existing weight loss interventions. Game of Stones builds on a successful feasibility study and aims to find out if automated text messages with or without endowment incentives are effective and cost-effective for weight loss at 12 months compared to a waiting list comparator arm in men with obesity. Methods: A 3-arm, parallel group, assessor-blind superiority randomised controlled trial with process evaluation will recruit 585 adult men with body mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more living in and around three UK centres (Belfast, Bristol, Glasgow), purposively targeting disadvantaged areas. Intervention groups: (i) automated, theory-informed text messages daily for 12 months plus endowment incentives linked to verified weight loss targets at 3, 6 and 12 months; (ii) the same text messages and weight loss assessment protocol; (iii) comparator group: 12 month waiting list, then text messages for 3 months. The primary outcome is percentage weight change at 12 months from baseline. Secondary outcomes at 12 months are as follows: quality of life, wellbeing, mental health, weight stigma, behaviours, satisfaction and confidence. Follow-up includes weight at 24 months. A health economic evaluation will measure cost-effectiveness over the trial and over modelled lifetime: including health service resource-use and quality-adjusted life years. The cost-utility analysis will report incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years gained. Participant and service provider perspectives will be explored via telephone interviews, and exploratory mixed methods process evaluation analyses will focus on mental health, multiple long-term conditions, health inequalities and implementation strategies. Discussion: The trial will report whether text messages (with and without cash incentives) can help men to lose weight over 1 year and maintain this for another year compared to a comparator group; the costs and benefits to the health service; and men's experiences of the interventions. Process analyses with public involvement and service commissioner input will ensure that this open-source digital self-care intervention could be sustainable and scalable by a range of NHS or public services.",10.1186/s13063-022-06504-5,"pubmed, wos",Research & Experimental Medicine,Randomised controlled trial; Men with obesity; Text messages; Financial incentives; Weight management; Health inequalities; Process evaluation; Cost-effectiveness,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-022-06504-5)

Methods Participants were randomized into intervention (10 minutes of daily usage of the Insight Timer app) or control groups. Participants completed surveys to assess anxiety and well-being pre-and post-study. Data were analyzed using t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), or nonparametric equivalents. Results Pre-study results were comparable between groups. The pre-vs. post-study General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores for anxiety decreased in the intervention group (n=18, median 5.5 vs. 3.0 (pre vs. post), p=0.0233, d=0.50), but not in the control group (n=28). The intervention group had a lower median GAD-7 score than the control group post-study (3.0 vs. 8.0, p=0.0223, d=0.35).

Effectiveness of Digital Health Literacy Interventions in Older Adults: Single-Arm Meta-Analysis,Not mental health,"Dong, Q; Liu, T; Liu, R; Yang, HX; Liu, CP",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,"Background: In a world of rapid digital technology development, the lack of digital health literacy (DHL) among older people cannot be ignored. DHL is becoming an essential competency that can facilitate the health status and health management of older adults. DHL interventions that are feasible and appropriate can be implemented on a large scale through the health care system for older people. Objective: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of DHL interventions for older adults. Methods: English publications in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to November 20, 2022. Two reviewers independently completed the data extraction and quality assessment. Review Manager (version 5.4; Cochrane Informatics & Technology Services) software was used for all meta-analyses. Results: A total of 7 studies, including 2 randomized controlled trials and 5 quasi-experimental studies, involving 710 older adults were considered eligible. The main outcome was scores on the eHealth Literacy Scale, and secondary outcomes were knowledge, self-efficacy, and skills. Quasi-experimental studies compared baseline and postintervention outcomes, while randomized controlled trials compared pre-and postintervention outcomes in the intervention group. Of the 7 studies, 3 used face-to-face instruction, while 4 adopted web-based interventions. Among them, 4 of the interventions were conducted using theoretical guidance, while 3 were not. Intervention duration varied from 2 to 8 weeks. In addition, the studies included were all conducted in developed countries, mainly in the United States. Pooled analysis presented that DHL interventions had positive effects on eHealth literacy efficacy (standardized mean difference 1.15, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.84; P=.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that DHL interventions that chose face-to-face teaching (standardized mean difference 1.15, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.84; P=.001), were guided by a conceptual framework (standardized mean difference 1.15, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.84; P=.001), and were sustained over 4 weeks (standardized mean difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.84; P=.001) had a more significant effect. Moreover, the outcomes showed considerable gains in knowledge (standardized mean difference 0.93, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.31; P<.001) and self-efficacy (standardized mean difference 0.96, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.77; P=.02). No statistically significant effect was found for skills (standardized mean difference 0.77, 95% CI -0.30 to 1.85; P=.16). The small number of studies, variable study quality, and heterogeneity are some limitations of this review.

Objective: We aimed to systematically synthesize available evidence and quantify the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions in reducing depression and anxiety in LMICs. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases from the inception date to February 2022. We included randomized controlled trials conducted in LMICs that compared groups that received digital health interventions with controls (active control, treatment as usual, or no intervention) on depression or anxiety symptoms. Two reviewers independently extracted summary data reported in the papers and performed study quality assessments. The outcomes were postintervention measures of depression or anxiety symptoms (Hedges g). We calculated the pooled effect size weighted by inverse variance. Results: Among 11,196 retrieved records, we included 80 studies in the meta-analysis (12,070 participants n=6052, 50.14% in the intervention group and n=6018, 49.85% in the control group) and 96 studies in the systematic review. The pooled effect sizes were -0.61 (95% CI -0.78 to -0.44; n=67 comparisons) for depression and -0.73 (95% CI -0.93 to -0.53; n=65 comparisons) for anxiety, indicating that digital health intervention groups had lower postintervention depression and anxiety symptoms compared with controls. Although heterogeneity was considerable (I2=0.94 for depression and 0.95 for anxiety), we found notable sources of variability between the studies, including intervention content, depression or anxiety symptom severity, control type, and age. Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development, and Evaluation showed that the evidence quality was overall high. Conclusions: Digital mental health tools are moderately to highly effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in LMICs.

Psycho-technology has greatly helped students cope more effectively with stress. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of three methods of intervention for stress management in students based on mindfulness-based stress reduction, including blended therapy, smartphone mobile application, and face-to-face therapy. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was designed with pretests, posttests, and follow-ups for a month on randomly selected students. The first group was treated by the Aramgar application only, the second group by both the face-to-face therapy and Aramgar application, and the third group by the face-to-face therapy only. The DASS 21 was utilized for both pretest and posttest administration. The ANOVA and post hoc tests were applied to analyze the data. Results: The mean age of the participants was 24.29 +/- 3.21 years. There was a significant difference in the mean score reduction of depression, stress, and anxiety between the three groups (P < 0.001). The post hoc test showed that the blended therapy group had the greatest mean score reduction on stress, depression, and anxiety among the three groups. Conclusions: The blended approach could improve the mental health of students more than the two other approaches.

Effectiveness of Self-Guided Virtual Reality-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Panic Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Shin, B; Oh, J; Kim, BH; Kim, HE; Kim, H; Kim, S; Kim, JJ",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2021,"Background: Virtual reality (VR) is as effective a technique as traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and a promising tool for treating panic disorder symptoms because VR exposure can be safer and has better acceptability than in vivo exposure and is more immersive than exposure through imagination. CBT techniques can be delivered more effectively using VR as well. So far, VR has required high-quality devices, but the development of mobile VR technology has improved user availability. At the same time, a well-structured form of VR can be reproduced and used anywhere. This means that VR can be used to provide a self-guided form of treatment and address the high treatment costs of evidence-based therapy and the lack of professional therapists. This study aimed to investigate the potential of self-guided VR as an alternative to high-cost treatment. Objective: The main goal of this study was to offer data about the efficacy of a mobile app-based self-led VR CBT in the treatment of panic disorder. Methods: A total of 54 subjects with panic disorder were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to either the VR treatment group or waitlist group. The VR treatment was designed to be total 12 sessions for 4 weeks. The VR treatment consists of 4 steps in which patients are gradually exposed to phobic stimuli while learning to cope with panic symptoms in each stage. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed through the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Body Sensations Questionnaire, Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire, Anxiety Sensitivity Index, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Korean Inventory of Social Avoidance and Distress Scale, Korean Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and Perceived Stress Scale. In addition, physiological changes using heart rate variability were evaluated. Results: In within-group analyses, the VR treatment group exhibited improvements in panic disorder symptoms, anxiety, and depression after 4 weeks, while the waitlist group did not show any significant improvement. Compared to the waitlist group, the VR treatment group showed significantly greater improvements in the Panic Disorder Severity Scale in both completer analysis and intention-to-treat analysis. Heart rate variability in the VR treatment group showed improvement in normalized high frequency from baseline to postassessment with no significant differences in any outcome measure between groups. Conclusions: The self-guided, mobile app-based VR intervention was effective in the treatment of panic symptoms and restoring the autonomic nervous system demonstrating the validity of the use of VR for self-guided treatment.

Effectiveness of Virtual Reality Interactive Play for Children During Intravenous Placement: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Hsu, MF; Whu, YW; Lin, IC; Liu, CY; Lai, FC; Liu, PC; Chen, CW",ASIAN NURSING RESEARCH,2022,"Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an interactive virtual reality (VR) play intervention including instructional play and emotional catharsis play sessions in reducing children's pain and fear during intravenous placement. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with parallel groups was conducted. The sample consisted of 134 hospitalized children aged 6-12 years (intervention group: n = 69; comparison group: n = 65). The intervention involved one immersive intravenous scene in VR before the actual intravenous placement and one emotional catharsis VR play after injection. The comparison group received an educational photo book about intravenous placement before receiving intravenous placement. The children and their caregivers rated their pain and fear by using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale and the Children's Fear Scale. The time required for successful intravenous insertion was also compared between the two groups. Results: Children's pain (p = .028) and fear scores (p = .004) were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the comparison group. Their caregivers' pain and fear scores (both p < .001) were significantly lower in the intervention group. The time required for successful intravenous insertion did not differ significantly between the intervention and comparison groups.Conclusions: The interactive play intervention with VR effectively reduced children's levels of pain and fear during the intravenous placement procedure.

Effectiveness of Virtual Reality in Symptom Management of Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Other,"Wu, Y; Wang, NN; Zhang, HC; Sun, XH; Wang, YQ; Zhang, YX",JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT,2023,"Context. Although the survival rate of cancer patients has been increasing, such patients often experience severe physical and psychological burdens due to the effects of the disease and therapy. Multiple virtual reality (VR)-based interventions have been used to help improve physical and psychological symptoms and quality of life in cancer patients. Objective. This study aimed to assess the effects of VR-based interventions on anxiety, pain, depression, fear, distress, and quality of life in cancer patients. Methods. We conducted systematic searches in the PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus and APA PsycINFO databases from their inception to August 16, 2022. Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted articles that met strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality assessments of the included studies were performed according to the Cochrane risk assessment tool, and data analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. Results. A total of 12 studies including 425 participants in the intervention group and 400 participants in the control group were selected for the final analysis. The results showed a significant difference between the VR and control groups for anxiety (standard mean difference [SMD] =-0.83, 95% CI-1.25 to-0.42, P< 0.001), SMD = pain (SMD =-0.86, 95% CI-1.36 to-0.35, P< 0.001), depression (SMD =-0.46, 95% CI-0.74 to-0.18, P = 0.001), fear (MD =-0.82, 95% CI-1.60 to-0.03, P = 0.04), and distress (SMD =-1.16, 95% CI-1.96 to-0.37, P = 0.004). However, no significant difference was observed in quality of life (SMD = 1.01, 95% CI-0.67 to 2.70, P = 0.24). Conclusions. VR interventions were effective in improving physical and psychological symptoms in cancer patients. Due to the limited number of studies, small sample sizes, and moderate to high heterogeneity, these results should be interpreted with caution. More rigorous, comprehensive and high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to validate the results of this study. Trial Registration.

Digital interventions have the potential to bridge this gap. OBJECTIVE To determine whether a coached, digital, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention improves outcomes for college women with EDs compared with referral to usual care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cluster randomized trial was conducted from 2014 to 2018 at 27 US universities. Women with binge-purge EDs (with both threshold and subthreshold presentations) were recruited from enrolled universities. The 690 participants were followed up for up to 2 years after the intervention. Data analysis was performed from February to September 2019. INTERVENTIONS Universities were randomized to the intervention, Student Bodies-Eating Disorders, a digital CBT-guided self-help program, or to referral to usual care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was change in overall ED psychopathology. Secondary outcomes were abstinence from binge eating and compensatory behaviors, as well as ED behavior frequencies, depression, anxiety, clinical impairment, academic impairment, and realized treatment access. RESULTS A total of 690 women with EDs (mean [SD] age, 22.12 [4.85] years; 414 [60.0%] White; 120 [17.4%] Hispanic; 512 [74.2%] undergraduates) were included in the analyses. For ED psychopathology, there was a significantly greater reduction in the intervention group compared with the control group at the postintervention assessment (beta [SE], -0.44 [0.10]; d = -0.40; t(1387) = -4.23; P < .001), as well as over the follow-up period (beta [SE], -0.39 [0.12]; d = -0.35; t(1387) = -3.30; P < .001). There was not a significant difference in abstinence from any ED behaviors at the postintervention assessment (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.48-4.62; P = .50) or at follow-up (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.63-3.58; P = .36). Compared with the control group, the intervention group had significantly greater reductions in binge eating (rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96; P = .02), compensatory behaviors (rate ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P < .001), depression (beta [SE], -1.34 [0.53]; d = -0.22; t(1387) = -2.52; P = .01), and clinical impairment (beta [SE], -2.33 [0.94]; d = -0.21; t(1387) = -2.49; P = .01) at the postintervention assessment, with these gains sustained through follow-up for all outcomes except binge eating. Groups did not differ in terms of academic impairment. The majority of intervention participants (318 of 385 participants [83%]) began the intervention, whereas only 28% of control participants (76 of 271 participants with follow-up data available) sought treatment for their ED (odds ratio, 12.36; 95% CI, 8.73-17.51; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cluster randomized clinical trial comparing a coached, digital CBT intervention with referral to usual care, the intervention was effective in reducing ED psychopathology, compensatory behaviors, depression, and clinical impairment through long-term follow-up, as well as realizing treatment access. No difference was found between the intervention and control groups for abstinence for all ED behaviors or academic impairment. Given its scalability, a coached, digital, CBT intervention for college women with EDs has the potential to address the wide treatment gap for these disorders.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.15633,"pubmed, wos",General & Internal Medicine,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.15633)
Effectiveness of a Guided Web-Based Self-help Intervention to Prevent Depression in Patients With Persistent Back Pain The PROD-BP Randomized Clinical Trial,Other,"Sander, LB; Paganini, S; Terhorst, Y; Schlicker, S; Lin, JX; Spanhel, K; Buntrock, C; Ebert, DD; Baumeister, H",JAMA PSYCHIATRY,2020,"IMPORTANCE Depression is a frequent comorbid condition in patients with persistent back pain and is associated with substantial adverse consequences, including the risk of developing opioid use disorders. Shifting the focus from depression treatment to preventing depression might be a viable way to reduce the disease burden. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based self-help intervention to reduce the incidence of major depressive episode (MDE) in patients with persistent back pain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prevention of Depression in Back Pain Patients (PROD-BP) was a pragmatic, observer-blinded randomized clinical trial with a parallel design conducted in Germany. Eligible adults with a diagnosis of persistent back pain and subclinical depressive symptoms, but who were depression free, were recruited either on-site or after discharge from 82 orthopedic clinics between October 1, 2015, and July 31, 2017. All analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle from October 31, 2018, to April 30, 2019. INTERVENTIONS The intervention group received an e-coach-guided, web-based self-help intervention that was based on cognitive behavioral therapy and tailored to the needs of patients with persistent back pain. The intervention included 6 obligatory modules and 3 optional modules to be completed by participants as well as feedback from e-coaches. Both the intervention and control groups had unrestricted access to treatment as usual. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was time to onset of an MDE over a 12-month period as assessed by blinded diagnostic raters using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. Secondary outcomes included depression severity, quality of life, pain intensity, pain-related disability, pain self-efficacy, work capacity, and user satisfaction assessed with a variety of instruments. RESULTS A total of 295 participants (mean [SD] age, 52.8 [7.7] years; 184 women [62.4%]) were recruited and randomized to either the intervention group (n = 149) or control group (n = 146). The intervention reduced the risk of MDE onset by 52%(hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.81; P < .001). Twenty-one participants (14.1%) in the intervention group and 41 participants (28.1%) in the control group experienced an MDE over the 12-month period. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 new case of MDE was 2.84 (95% CI, 1.79-9.44). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this trial showed that among patients with persistent back pain, depression can be prevented by a guided web-based self-help intervention in addition to treatment as usual. This finding suggests that using a scalable digital approach to integrate psychological treatment into routine pain management is feasible.",10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.1021,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.1021)

App-based mindfulness meditation combined with an electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) shows promise as effective and accessible adjuncts in medical practice.Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a BCI-based mindfulness meditation app in improving the experience of patients with AF during RFCA.Methods: This single-center pilot randomized controlled trial involved 84 eligible patients with AF scheduled for RFCA, who were randomized 1:1 to the intervention and control groups. Both groups received a standardized RFCA procedure and a conscious sedative regimen. Patients in the control group were administered conventional care, while those in the intervention group received BCI-based app-delivered mindfulness meditation from a research nurse. The primary outcomes were the changes in the numeric rating scale, State Anxiety Inventory, and Brief Fatigue Inventory scores. Secondary outcomes were the differences in hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, and peripheral oxygen saturation), adverse events, patient-reported pain, and the doses of sedative drugs used in ablation.Results: BCI-based app-delivered mindfulness meditation, compared to conventional care, resulted in a significantly lower mean numeric rating scale (mean 4.6, SD 1.7 [app-based mindfulness meditation] vs mean 5.7, SD 2.1 [conventional care]; P=.008), State Anxiety Inventory (mean 36.7, SD 5.5 vs mean 42.3, SD 7.2; P<.001), and Brief Fatigue Inventory (mean 3.4, SD 2.3 vs mean 4.7, SD 2.2; P=.01) scores. No significant differences were observed in hemodynamic parameters or the amounts of parecoxib and dexmedetomidine used in RFCA between the 2 groups. The intervention group exhibited a significant decrease in fentanyl use compared to the control group, with a mean dose of 3.96 (SD 1.37) mcg/kg versus 4.85 (SD 1.25) mcg/kg in the control group (P=.003).The incidence of adverse events was lower in the intervention group (5/40) than in the control group (10/40), though this difference was not significant (P=.15).Conclusions: BCI-based app-delivered mindfulness meditation effectively relieved physical and psychological discomfort and may reduce the doses of sedative medication used in RFCA for patients with AF.",10.2196/44855,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,atrial fibrillation; radiofrequency catheter ablation; mindfulness meditation; brain computer interface; mHealth; smartphone app; randomized controlled trial,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/44855)
Effectiveness of a Mobile App Intervention for Preparing Preschool Children and Parents for Day Surgery: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not mental health,"Kerimaa, H; Hakala, M; Haapea, M; Vähänikkilä, H; Serlo, W; He, HG; Pölkki, T",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Day surgery allows families to return home quickly. Only a few approaches to preparing for day surgery have demonstrated how digital solutions can support families and children. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile app intervention on preschool children's fear and pain and parents' anxiety and stress in preparing children for day surgery. Methods: This study was conducted at the Pediatric Day Surgical Department of a university hospital in Finland between 2018 and 2020. Parents of children (aged 2-6 y) who were in a queue for elective day surgery were randomized into the intervention group (IG; n=36) and control group (CG; n=34). The CG received routine preparations, whereas the IG was prepared using a mobile app. Parents' and children's outcomes were measured using validated scales at 4 different points: at home (T1 and T4) and at the hospital (T2 and T3) before and after surgery. Group differences were analyzed using statistical methods suitable for the material. Results: Before surgery, parents in both groups experienced mild anxiety, which decreased after surgery. Parental anxiety did not differ between groups preoperatively (P=.78) or postoperatively (P=.63). Both groups had less anxiety at home after surgery compared with before. The IG showed a significant decrease (P=.003); the CG also improved (P=.002). Preoperatively at home, most parents in both groups experienced no stress or mild stress (P=.61). Preoperatively at the hospital, parents in both groups experienced mild stress; however, parents in the IG experienced more stress during this phase (P=.02). Parents in the IG experienced significantly less stress postoperatively than those in the CG (P=.05). Both groups showed decreased stress levels from before to after surgery (IG: P=.003; CG: P=.004) within each group. There were no significant differences in children's pain levels between the groups and measurement points. This was observed before surgery at home (P=.25), before surgery at the hospital (P=.98), and after surgery at the hospital (P=.72). Children's fear decreased more in the IG (P=.006) than in the CG (P=.44) comparing the phases before and after surgery at home. Fear did not differ between the IG and CG preoperatively at home (P=.20) or at the hospital (P=.59) or postoperatively at the hospital (P=.62) or at home (P=.81). Conclusions: The mobile app intervention did not reduce anxiety or pain. However, it was observed that parents in the IG experienced substantially heightened stress levels before surgery at the hospital, which decreased significantly after surgery at home. In addition, fear levels in children in the IG decreased over time, whereas no significant change was observed in the CG.

"Effectiveness of a Self-Management Program to Improve Cognition and Quality of Life in Epilepsy A Pragmatic, Randomized, Multicenter Trial",Good,"Streltzov, NA; Schmidt, SS; Schommer, LM; Zhao, W; Tosteson, TD; Mazanec, MT; Kiriakopoulos, ET; Chu, F; Henninger, HL; Nagle, K; Roth, RM; Jobst, B",NEUROLOGY,2022,"Background and Objectives We conducted a multisite, pragmatic replication trial at 4 New England epilepsy centers to determine the effectiveness of Home-Based Self-Management and Cognitive Training Changes Lives (HOBSCOTCH) in a real-world setting and to assess feasibility of a virtual intervention. Methods HOBSCOTCH is an 8-session intervention addressing cognitive impairment and quality of life (QoL) for people with epilepsy (PWE). Participants were recruited from epilepsy centers in 4 states and block-randomized into the following groups: in-person HOBSCOTCH (H-IP), virtual HOBSCOTCH (H-V), and waitlist control. Outcome measures were assessed for all groups at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months; intervention groups received long-term follow-up at 9 and 12 months. Results A total of 108 participants were recruited, of whom 85 were included in this analysis (age at baseline 47.5 +/- 11.5 years; 68% female). Participants completing the in-person intervention (H-IP) had a 12.4-point improvement in QoL score compared with controls (p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons found a 6.2-point treatment effect for subjective cognition in the H-IP group (p < 0.001). There were no meaningful group differences in objective cognition or health care utilization at any time points and the treatment effect for QoL diminished by 6 months. The virtual intervention demonstrated feasibility but did not significantly improve outcomes compared with controls. Within-group analysis found improvements in QoL for both H-V and H-IP. Discussion This study replicated the effectiveness of the HOBSCOTCH program in improving QoL for PWE. The study was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the distance-delivered intervention may be particularly well-suited for the current environment. Future research will explore modifications designed to improve the efficacy of H-V and the sustainability of HOBSCOTCH's treatment effect.

Effectiveness of a Self-Monitoring App in Supporting Physical Activity Maintenance Among Rural Canadians With Cancer After an Exercise Oncology Program: Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Ester, M; Wagoner, CW; Dreger, J; Chen, GM; McDonough, MH; McNeely, ML; Culos-Reed, SN",JMIR CANCER,2023,"Background: Despite the benefits of physical activity (PA) for individuals with cancer, most remain insufficiently active. Exercise oncology interventions can improve PA levels. Individuals struggle to maintain PA levels after interventions because of persistent psychological and environmental PA barriers. Health technology (eHealth) may address some PA barriers and deliver effective, scalable PA interventions in oncology, yet its effectiveness for changing PA levels remains mixed. Using eHealth to support PA maintenance among rural populations with cancer, who may need greater PA support given lower PA levels and worse health outcomes, remains under-studied.Objective: This study examined the effectiveness of an app-based self-monitoring intervention in supporting PA maintenance among rural populations with cancer after a supervised web-based exercise oncology program.Methods: This 2-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial was embedded within the Exercise for Cancer to Enhance Living Well (EXCEL) effectiveness-implementation study. Upon consent, participants were randomized 1:1 by EXCEL class clusters to the intervention (24 weeks of app-based PA self-monitoring) or waitlist control (app access after 24 weeks). Both groups completed a 12-week supervised web-based exercise oncology program followed by a 12-week self-directed PA maintenance period. Baseline demographics, eHealth literacy, and patient-reported outcomes were compared using chi-square and 2-tailed t tests. App use was measured throughout the intervention. The primary outcome-self-reported moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) minutes-and secondary outcomes-objective MVPA minutes and steps and app usability ratings-were collected at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. Intervention effects on self-report MVPA maintenance were assessed via linear mixed modeling, with secondary outcomes explored descriptively.Results: Of the 359 eligible EXCEL participants, 205 (57.1%) consented, 199 (55.4%; intervention: 106/199, 53.3%; control: 93/199, 46.7%) started the study, and 183 (51%; intervention: 100/183, 54.6%; control: 83/183, 45.4%) and 141 (39.3%; intervention: 69/141, 48.9%; control: 72/141, 51.1%) completed 12-and 24-week measures, respectively. Mean age was 57.3 (SD 11.5) years. Most participants were female (174/199, 87.4%), White (163/199, 81.9%), and diagnosed with breast cancer (108/199, 54.3%). Median baseline self-report weekly MVPA minutes were 60.0 (IQR 0-180) and 40.0 (IQR 0-135) for the intervention and waitlist control groups, respectively (P=.74). Median app use duration was 10.3 (IQR 1.3-23.9) weeks, with 9.6 (IQR 4.4-17.8) self-monitoring entries/week. Both groups increased their weekly MVPA minutes significantly at 12 weeks (P<.001) and maintained the increases at 24 weeks (P<.001), relative to baseline, with no between-group differences (P=.87). The intervention group had significantly higher step counts for 7 of the 12 weeks during the PA maintenance period (P=.048 to <.001).Conclusions: The app-based self-monitoring intervention did not improve MVPA maintenance but may have contributed to increased step counts during the PA maintenance period.

Effectiveness of a Technology-Based Supportive Educational Parenting Program on Parental Outcomes (Part 1): Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Shorey, S; Ng, YPM; Ng, ED; Siew, AL; Mörelius, E; Yoong, J; Gandhi, M",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: Transitioning into parenthood can be stressful for new parents, especially with the lack of continuity of care from health care professionals during the postpartum period. Short hospital stays limit the availability of support and time parents need to be well equipped with parenting and infant care skills. Poor parental adjustment may, in turn, lead to negative parental outcomes and adversely affect the child's development. For the family's future well-being, and to facilitate a smoother transition into parenthood, there is a need for easily accessible, technology-based educational programs to support parents during the crucial perinatal period. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a technology-based supportive educational parenting program (SEPP) on parenting outcomes during the perinatal period in couples. Methods: A randomized, single-blinded, parallel-armed, controlled trial was conducted. The study recruited 236 parents (118 couples) from an antenatal clinic of a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Eligible parents were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=118) or the control group (n=118). The SEPP is based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory and Bowlby's theory of attachment. Components of the intervention include 2 telephone-based educational sessions (1 antenatal and 1 immediately postnatal) and a mobile health app follow-up for 1 month. The control group only received routine perinatal care provided by the hospital. Outcome measures including parenting self-efficacy (PSE), parental bonding, perceived social support, parenting satisfaction, postnatal depression (PND), and anxiety were measured using reliable and valid instruments. Data were collected over 6 months at 4 time points: during pregnancy (third trimester), 2 days postpartum, 1 month postpartum, and 3 months postpartum. Outcomes were standardized using baseline means and SDs. Linear mixed models were used to compare the groups for postpartum changes in the outcome variables. Results: The intervention group showed significantly better outcome scores than the control group from baseline to 3 months postpartum for PSE (mean difference, MD, 0.37; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.68; P=.02), parental bonding (MD -1.32; 95% CI -1.89 to -0.75; P<.001), self-perceived social support (MD 0.69; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.19; P=.01), parenting satisfaction (MD 1.40; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.93; P<.001), and PND (MD -0.91; 95% CI -1.34 to -0.49; P<.001). Postnatal anxiety (PNA) scores of the intervention group were only significantly better after adjusting for covariates (MD -0.82; 95% CI -1.15 to -0.49; P<.001). Conclusions: The technology-based SEPP is effective in enhancing parental bonding, PSE, perceived social support and parental satisfaction, and in reducing PND and PNA. Health care professionals could incorporate it with existing hands-on infant care classes and routine care to better meet parents' needs and create positive childbirth experiences, which may in turn encourage parents to have more children.",10.2196/10816,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,parents; social support,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/10816)

In recent years, sexting has become a public health concern. Surveys in Malaysia show a high prevalence of young adults engaged in sexting. Given that sexting is associated with sexual risk behavior, cyberbullying, and mental health issues, this behavior needs intervention to alleviate the resulting public health burden. However, there is a scarcity of theorybased intervention programs on the prevention of intention and willingness to sext among young adults. Objective: This study aimed to develop and implement a sexting intervention module guided by the prototype willingness model (PWM), delivered using web-based animated video, and evaluate its effectiveness among diploma students from a public higher educational institution. The primary outcomes were intention and willingness to sext, while the secondary outcomes were knowledge, attitude, perceived norms, and prototype perceptions of sexting. Methods: This 2-armed, parallel, single-blinded cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in a public higher educational institution in the state of Melaka, Malaysia. Diploma students from 12 programs were randomly allocated into intervention and control groups. Both groups answered a self-administered web-based questionnaire assessing the outcomes at the baseline. The intervention group received a newly developed intervention module based on the PWM in the form of 5 animated videos posted on a private YouTube platform, while the control group was put on the waitlist. The intervention group was encouraged to discuss any issues raised with the researchers via WhatsApp private chat after viewing the videos. All participants were observed immediately and 3 months postintervention. Data analysis was performed with SPSS (version 26; IBM Corp). A generalized linear mixed model was used to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Results: There were a total of 300 participants with an attrition rate of 8.3% (n=25). After adjusting for age, sex, relationship status, and the amount of time spent on the web, there were significant differences in the intention to sext (beta=-.12; P=.002; Cohen d=0.35) between the intervention and control groups over 3 months. Conclusions: In this study, the sexting intervention module using the PWM that was delivered via web-based animated videos was effective in reducing intention and willingness to sext as well as in improving knowledge of sexting, attitudes, perceived norms, and prototype perceptions.

Effectiveness of a Web-Based Intervention to Prevent Anxiety in the Children of Parents With Anxiety: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Other,"Dunn, A; Alvarez, J; Arbon, A; Bremner, S; Elsby-Pearson, C; Emsley, R; Jones, C; Lawrence, P; Lester, KJ; Majdandzi, M; Morson, N; Perry, N; Simner, J; Thomson, A; Cartwright-Hatton, S",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2022,"Background: Anxiety is the most common childhood mental health condition and is associated with impaired child outcomes, including increased risk of mental health difficulties in adulthood. Anxiety runs in families: when a parent has anxiety, their child has a 50% higher chance of developing it themselves. Environmental factors are predominant in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and, of these, parenting processes play a major role. Interventions that target parents to support them to limit the impact of any anxiogenic parenting behaviors are associated with reduced anxiety in their children. A brief UK-based group intervention delivered to parents within the UK National Health Service led to a 16% reduction in children meeting the criteria for an anxiety disorder. However, this intervention is not widely accessible. To widen access, a 9-module web-based version of this intervention has been developed. This course comprises psychoeducation and home practice delivered through text, video, animations, and practice tasks.Objective: This study seeks to evaluate the feasibility of delivering this web-based intervention and assess its effectiveness in reducing child anxiety symptoms.Methods: This is the protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a community sample of 1754 parents with self-identified high levels of anxiety with a child aged 2-11 years. Parents in the intervention arm will receive access to the web-based course, which they undertake at a self-determined rate. The control arm receives no intervention.

Preconception paternal and maternal risk factors such as obesity and inadequate diet affect the metabolic and cardiovascular health of their offspring later in life. This highlights the importance of diet and dietary behaviour in the years before parenthood. In our project, PREPARED, we will evaluate the effectiveness of a digital intervention targeting young adults. Our primary aim is to improve participants' preconception diet, and our secondary aim is to improve preconception quality of life and maternal and child perinatal outcomes. Methods and analysis We plan to recruit 7000 men and women individually, aged 20-35 years without children, to be randomised to an intervention or a control group. The intervention group will receive access to a digital resource for 6 months promoting a healthy diet for their health now, later in life and for the next generation. Follow-up is up to 20 years or until they have their first child. To evaluate intervention effects, we will collect dietary data (2x24-hour dietary recalls and a screener).

Effectiveness of a facilitation programme using a mobile application for initiating advance care planning discussions between patients with advanced cancer and healthcare providers: protocol for a randomised controlled trial (J-SUPPORT 2104),Not mental health,"Obama, K; Fujimori, M; Okamura, M; Kadowaki, M; Ueno, T; Boku, N; Mori, M; Akechi, T; Yamaguchi, T; Oyamada, S; Okizaki, A; Miyaji, T; Sakurai, N; Uchitomi, Y",BMJ OPEN,2023,"Introduction Timely implementation of the discussion process of advance care planning (ACP) is recommended. The communication attitude of healthcare providers is critical in ACP facilitation; thus, improving their communication attitudes may reduce patient distress and unnecessary aggressive treatment while enhancing care satisfaction. Digital mobile devices are being developed for behavioural interventions owing to their low space and time restrictions and ease of information sharing. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention programme using an application intended to facilitate patient questioning behaviour on improving communication related to ACP between patients with advanced cancer and healthcare providers. Methods and analysis This study uses a parallel-group, evaluator-blind, randomised controlled trial design. We plan to recruit 264 adult patients with incurable advanced cancer at the National Cancer Centre in Tokyo, Japan. Intervention group participants use a mobile application ACP programme and undergo a 30min interview with a trained intervention provider for discussions with the oncologist at the next patient visit, while control group participants continue their usual treatment. The primary outcome is the oncologist's communication behaviour score assessed using audiorecordings of the consultation. Secondary outcomes include communication between patients and oncologists and the patients' distress, quality of life, care goals and preferences, and medical care utilisation. We will use a full analysis set including the registered participant population who receive at least a part of the intervention. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Scientific Advisory Board of the Japan Supportive, Palliative and Psychosocial Oncology Group (Registration No. 2104) and the Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer Centre Hospital (registration No. 2020-500). Written informed consent is obtained from the patients. The results of the trial will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at scientific meetings.

Given that occupational sedentary time contributes significantly to the total amount of daily sedentariness, incorporating programmes to reduce occupational sedentary time in patients with chronic disease would allow for physical, mental and productivity benefits. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short-, medium- and long-term effectiveness of a mHealth programme for sitting less and moving more at work on habitual and occupational sedentary behaviour and physical activity in office staff with DM2. Secondary aims. To evaluate the effectiveness on glycaemic control and lipid profile at 6- and 12-month follow-up; anthropometric profile, blood pressure, mental well-being and work-related post-intervention outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 months. Methods: Multicentre randomized controlled trial. A sample size of 220 patients will be randomly allocated into a control (n = 110) or intervention group (n = 110), with post-intervention follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Health professionals from Spanish Primary Health Care units will randomly invite patients (18-65 years of age) diagnosed with DM2, who have sedentary office desk-based jobs. The control group will receive usual healthcare and information on the health benefits of sitting less and moving more. The intervention group will receive, through a smartphone app and website, strategies and real-time feedback for 13 weeks to change occupational sedentary behaviour. Variables: (1) Subjective and objective habitual and occupational sedentary behaviour and physical activity (Workforce Sitting Questionnaire, Brief Physical Activity Assessment Tool, activPAL3TM); 2) Glucose, HbA1c; 3) Weight, height, waist circumference; 4) Total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides; (5) Systolic, diastolic blood pressure; (6) Mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being); (7) Presenteeism (Work Limitations Questionnaire); (8) Impact of work on employees health, sickness absence (6th European Working Conditions Survey); (9) Job-related mental strain (Job Content Questionnaire). Differences between groups pre- and post- intervention on the average value of the variables will be analysed. Discussion: If the mHealth intervention is effective in reducing sedentary time and increasing physical activity in office employees with DM2, health professionals would have a low-cost tool for the control of patients with chronic disease.",10.1186/s12889-022-13676-x,"pubmed, wos","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Mobile applications; Smartphone; Sedentary behaviour; Physical activity; Office employees; Primary healthcare; Diabetes mellitus type 2; Workplace,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13676-x)
Effectiveness of a mindfulness-oriented substance use prevention program for boys with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Waedel, L; Daubmann, A; Zapf, A; Reis, O",BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,2020,"BackgroundBoys with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities (MBID) are at particular risk to drink in harmful ways once they start to consume alcohol. Interventions based on mindfulness have been proven to be effective in preventing substance use, but mostly for adults with MBID. A mindfulness oriented intervention targeting 11-17years old boys will be tested in a randomised controlled trial. Study aim is to investigate the benefits of this new intervention compared to an active control condition within a 12months follow-up.MethodsIn this randomised controlled proof of concept study, 82 boys with MBID who consumed any alcohol during the last year will be randomised either to the 6 week mindfulness oriented intervention or the control group receiving a control intervention equal in dose and length. The intervention group undergoes mindfulness training combined with interactive drug education, while the control group completes a health training combined with the same education. In the intention-to-treat analysis the primary outcome is the self-reported delay of first post-intervention drunkeness within a 12months follow-up time span, measured weekly with a short app-based questionnaire. Secondary outcome is the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs within 30days post-intervention. Changes in neurobiological behavioural parameters, such as impulse control, reward anticipation, and decision making, are also investigated. Other secondary outcomes regard trait mindfulness, emotion regulation, psychopathological symptoms, peer networks, perceived stress, and quality of life. In addition, a prospective registry will be established to record specific data on the population of 11-17year old boys with MBID without any alcohol experience.DiscussionThis study offers the opportunity to gain first evidence of the effectiveness of a mindfulness-oriented program for the prevention of substance use for boys with MBID.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00014042.

Effectiveness of a mobile app-based educational intervention to treat internet gaming disorder among Iranian adolescents: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Other,"Pakpour, AH; Fazeli, S; Zeidi, IM; Alimoradi, Z; Georgsson, M; Brostrom, A; Potenza, MN",TRIALS,2022,"Background: The use of video games, a hobby for many teenagers in their leisure time, has brought with it a new potential for concerns. Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a mental condition classified as a disorder due to addictive behaviors. It may include use of video games, both online and offline. Consequences of IGD may include introversion, social anxiety, mood swings, loneliness, sleep problems, behavioral problems, depression, low self-esteem, and increased violence. In order to design an app-based intervention for adolescents, a transtheoretical model (TTM) has been used. This widely used model in the field of behavioral change is also practical for health education programs. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used to make people more aware of their behaviors, feelings and thoughts and how to achieve behavioral change. The present study seeks to determine the effectiveness of this app-based intervention in in the treatment of IGD among adolescents. Method: In this single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 206 high-school adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in Qazvin city will be recruited. Eligible adolescents will be randomly assigned into intervention and control groups. Eight consecutive sessions delivered over 2 months and based on the TTM and CBT will be delivered through the 'app (named HAPPYTEEN) to the intervention group. The control group will receive a sleep hygiene intervention (8 consecutive sessions for 2 months) via the app. Data collection tools include the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, Stages of Change Questionnaire, Decision Balance, and Self-Efficacy. The study measures will be completed at baseline, post intervention, and 1 month and 3 months after the intervention.

Effectiveness of a nursing board games in psychiatric nursing course for undergraduate nursing students: An experimental design,Not Digital,"Wu, CS; Chen, MF; Hwang, HL; Lee, BO",NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE,2023,"Aim: To examine the effectiveness of a psychiatric nursing board game in an undergraduate psychiatric nursing course.Background: Didactic teaching fails to assist students in deepening their understanding of abstract concepts in psychiatric nursing. The game-based learning of professional courses can address the demands of digital-age students, which may improve their learning outcomes.Design: A parallel two-arm experimental design was adopted in a nursing college in southern Taiwan. Methods: The participants were fourth-year students enroled in a college nursing programme in southern Taiwan. Simple random sampling was used to divide the class into intervention and control groups. The former participated in an eight-week game-based intervention course, while the latter continued to receive traditional instruction. In addition to collecting the students' demographic data, three structural questionnaires were developed to examine the variation in students' nursing knowledge and attitudes toward psychiatric nursing, as well as their learning satisfaction before and after the intervention.Results: There were a total of 106 participants, with 53 in each group. After the intervention, the two groups were significantly different in terms of their psychiatric nursing knowledge, attitudes and self-reported learning satisfaction. The intervention group's scores were significantly higher than those of the control group across all three dimensions. This suggests the positive effects of the board game intervention on students' learning outcomes.Conclusion: The research outcome can be applied in formative and undergraduate nursing education in teaching psychiatric nursing globally. The game-based learning materials developed can be used to train psychiatric nursing teachers. Future studies should recruit a larger sample and increase the follow-up time for assessing students' learning outcomes, as well as examine the similarities and differences in the learning outcomes of students from different educational systems.",10.1016/j.nepr.2023.103657,"pubmed, wos",Nursing,Board game; Psychiatric nursing; Learning outcome; Nursing students; Innovative teaching,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nepr.2023.103657)
Effectiveness of a person-centred eHealth intervention in reducing symptoms of burnout in patients with common mental disorders - secondary outcome analysis of a randomized controlled trial,Other,"Alsén, S; Hadzibajramovic, E; Jonsdottir, IH; Ali, L; Fors, A",BMC PRIMARY CARE,2023,"Background The number of people with common mental disorders (CMDs), especially stress-related disorders, has increased in several countries, including Sweden, during the past decade. Patients seeking care for long-term stress report severe symptoms. Although person-centred care (PCC) has shown several benefits, studies evaluating the effects of a PCC eHealth intervention on patients with CMDs are scarce.Objective The aim of this study was to compare levels of self-reported symptoms of burnout between a control group receiving treatment as usual (TAU) and an intervention group receiving TAU with the addition of a person-centred eHealth intervention, in patients on sick leave for CMDs.Methods This study reports analysis of a secondary outcome measure from a randomized controlled trial. Patients (n = 209) on sick leave for CMDs were recruited from nine primary health care centres and allocated to either a control group (n = 107) or an intervention group (n = 102). The intervention consisted of phone support and an interactive digital platform built on PCC principles. Self-reported symptoms of burnout were assessed using the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ) at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.Results Our findings showed changes in SMBQ scores over time in both the control and the intervention group. There was no significant difference in SMBQ scores between the groups; however, a difference in change over time between the groups was observed. The SMBQ scores decreased significantly more in the intervention group than in the controls between 0 and 3 months and between 0 and 6 months. No differences in change between the two groups were seen between the 3- and 6-month follow-ups.Conclusion This person-centred eHealth intervention for patients on sick leave for CMDs showed a slight initial effect in reducing symptoms of burnout.

IMWs experience multiple barriers to accessing mental health care. Two scalable interventions developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) were adapted to address some of these barriers: Doing What Matters in times of stress (DWM), a guided self-help web application, and Problem Management Plus (PM +), a brief facilitator-led program to enhance coping skills. This study examines whether DWM and PM + remotely delivered as a stepped-care programme (DWM/PM +) is effective and cost-effective in reducing psychological distress, among Polish migrant workers with psychological distress living in the Netherlands.Methods The stepped-care DWM/PM + intervention will be tested in a two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) among adult Polish migrant workers with self-reported psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; K10 > 15.9). Participants (n = 212) will be randomized into either the intervention group that receives DWM/PM + with psychological first aid (PFA) and care-as-usual (enhanced care-as-usual or eCAU), or into the control group that receives PFA and eCAU-only (1:1 allocation ratio). Baseline, 1-week post-DWM (week 7), 1-week post-PM + (week 13), and follow-up (week 21) self-reported assessments will be conducted. The primary outcome is psychological distress, assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Secondary outcomes are self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), resilience, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. In a process evaluation, stakeholders' views on barriers and facilitators to the implementation of DWM/PM + will be evaluated.Discussion To our knowledge, this is one of the first RCTs that combines two scalable, psychosocial WHO interventions into a stepped-care programme for migrant populations.

Effectiveness of a supportive care program via a smartphone application on the quality of life and care burden among family caregivers of patients with major depressive disorder: a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Minaei-Moghadam, S; Manzari, ZS; Vaghee, S; Mirhosseini, S",BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,2024,"Background The majority of patients with major depressive disorder require care that has generally affected caregivers' lives. Providing care could cause negative experiences as a care burden and deteriorate quality of life. However, there is a lack of evidence about caregiver training-based informatics and its impact on the caregiver's life.Methods This experimental study was carried out in Mashhad, Iran. A total of 60 primary family caregivers of patients with major depressive disorder were included in the study between February and July 2021. The quadruple block randomization method was used to allocate the participants into control and intervention groups. In the intervention group, family caregivers used the application with weekly phone calls for one month. The app contains the most important points of patient care and has the possibility of communicating with the nurse. The Novak and Guest Care Burden Inventory and the short form of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire were completed before and after the intervention. Data analysis was performed using chi-squared tests, independent sample t tests, and analysis of covariance.Results At baseline, the mean scores of care burden and quality of life were homogeneous between the two groups. After the intervention, the mean scores of care burden and quality of life were significantly reduced and improved in the intervention group compared with the control group (p < 0.001).Conclusions Using the application with the ability to communicate with the caregiver, along with educational support, helps to strengthen the relationship between the family caregiver and the nurse.

The aim of this project is to design, develop and evaluate an online personalized intervention based on a risk algorithm for the universal prevention of anxiety disorders in the general population. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms (prevANS vs usual care) and 1-year follow-up including 2000 participants without anxiety disorders from Spain and Portugal will be conducted. The prevANS intervention will be self-guided and can be implemented from the prevANS web or from the participants' Smartphone (through an App). The prevANS intervention will have different intensities depending on the risk level of the population, evaluated from the risk algorithm for anxiety: predictA. Both low and moderate-high risk participants will receive information on their level and profile (risk factors) of anxiety dis-orders, will have access to stress management tools and psychoeducational information periodically. In addition, participants with a moderate-high risk of anxiety disorders will also have access to cognitive-behavioral training (problem-solving, decision-making, communication skills, and working with thoughts). The control group will not receive any intervention, but they will fill out the same questionnaires as the intervention group. Assessments will be completed at baseline, 6 and 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome is the cumulative incidence of anxiety disorders. Secondary outcomes include depressive and anxiety symptoms, risk probability of anxiety disorders (predictA algorithm) and depression (predictD algorithm), improvement in physical and mental quality of life, and acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention. In addition, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will also be carried out from two perspectives, societal and health system, and analyses of mediators and moderators will also be performed.Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, prevANS study will be the first to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a personalized online intervention based on a risk predictive algorithm for the universal prevention of anxiety disorders.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05682365.",10.1016/j.invent.2023.100640,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Psychiatry,Anxiety disorders; Prevention; Internet-based interventions Mobile-based interventions RCT,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2023.100640)
Effectiveness of an App-Based Short Intervention to Improve Sleep: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not mental health,"Vollert, B; Müller, L; Jacobi, C; Trockel, M; Beintner, I",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2023,"Background: A growing body of evidence for digital interventions to improve sleep shows promising effects. The interventions investigated so far have been primarily web-based; however, app-based interventions may reach a wider audience and be more suitable for daily use.Objective: This study aims to evaluate the intervention effects, adherence, and acceptance of an unguided app-based intervention for individuals who wish to improve their sleep.Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of an app-based short intervention (Refresh) to improve sleep compared with a waitlist condition. Refresh is an 8-week unguided intervention covering the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and including a sleep diary. The primary outcome was sleep quality (insomnia symptoms) as self-assessed by the Regensburg Insomnia Scale (RIS). The secondary outcomes were depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score) and perceived insomnia-related impairment.Results: We included 371 participants, of which 245 reported poor sleep at baseline. About 1 in 3 participants who were allocated to the intervention group never accessed the intervention. Active participants completed on average 4 out of 8 chapters. Retention rates were 67.4% (n=250) at postassessment and 57.7% (n=214) at the 6-month follow-up. At postintervention, insomnia symptoms in the intervention group had improved more than those in the waitlist group, with a small effect (d=0.26) in the whole sample and a medium effect (d=0.45) in the subgroup with poor sleep. Effects in the intervention group were maintained at follow-up. Perceived insomnia-related impairment also improved from pre-to postassessment. No significant intervention effect on depression was detected. Working alliance and acceptance were moderate to good. Conclusions: An app-based, unguided intervention is a feasible and effective option to scale-up CBT-I-based treatment, but intervention uptake and adherence need to be carefully addressed.Trial Registration: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN53553517; https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN53553517",10.2196/39052,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,sleep; insomnia; cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia; eHealth; mobile app,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/39052)

Methods: College students (n=150) with elevated levels of stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4-item version, PSS-4 >= 8) were randomly assigned to either an internet- and mobile-based stress intervention group with feedback on demand or a waitlist control group. Self-report data were assessed at baseline, posttreatment (7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was perceived stress posttreatment (PSS-4). Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and college-related outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted in students with clinically relevant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale >17). Results: A total of 106 participants (76.8%) indicated that they were first-time help-seekers, and 77.3% (intervention group: 58/75; waitlist control group: 58/75) showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline. Findings indicated significant effects of the intervention compared with the waitlist control group for stress (d=0.69; 95% CI 0.36-1.02), anxiety (d=0.76; 95% CI 0.43-1.09), depression (d=0.63; 95% CI 0.30-0.96), college-related productivity (d=0.33; 95% CI 0.01-0.65), academic work impairment (d=0.34; 95% CI 0.01-0.66), and other outcomes after 7 weeks (posttreatment).

Effectiveness of an Internet-Based and Telephone-Assisted Training for Parents of 4-Year-Old Children With Disruptive Behavior: Implementation Research,Other,"Sourander, A; Ristkari, T; Kurki, M; Gilbert, S; Hinkka-Yli-Salomäki, S; Kinnunen, M; Pulkki-Råback, L; McGrath, PJ",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2022,"Background: There is a lack of effectiveness studies when digital parent training programs are implemented in real-world practice. The efficacy of the internet-based and telephone-assisted Finnish Strongest Families Smart Website (SFSW) parent training intervention on the disruptive behavior of 4-year-old children was studied in a randomized controlled trial setting in Southwest Finland between 2011 and 2013. After that, the intervention was implemented nationwide in child health clinics from 2015 onwards. Objective: The main aim of this study was to compare the treatment characteristics and effectiveness of the SFSW parent training intervention between the families who received the intervention when it was implemented as a normal practice in child health clinics and the families who received the same intervention during the randomized controlled trial. Methods: The implementation group comprised 600 families who were recruited in the SFSW intervention between January 2015 and May 2017 in real-world implementation. The RCT intervention group comprised 232 families who were recruited between October 2011 and November 2013. The same demographic and child and parent measures were collected from both study groups and were compared using linear mixed-effect models for repeated measurements. The child psychopathology and functioning level were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) version 1.5-5 for preschool children, the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU), and a modified version of the Barkley Home Situations Questionnaire. Parenting skills were measured using the 31-item Parenting Scale and the shorter 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The estimated child and parent outcomes were adjusted for CBCL externalizing scores at baseline, maternal education, duration of the behavior problems, and paternal age. The baseline measurements of each outcome were used as covariates. Results: The implementation group was more likely to complete the intervention than the RCT intervention group (514/600, 85.7% vs 176/232, 75.9%, respectively; P<.001). There were no significant differences between the implementation and RCT intervention groups with regard to child measures, including CBCL externalizing score (-0.2, 95% CI -1.3 to 1.6; P=.83), total score (-0.7, 95% CI -3.0 to 4.5; P=.70), internalizing score (-0.3, 95% CI -1.0 to 1.6; P=.64), and ICU total score (-0.4, 95% Cl -1.9 to 1.2; P=.64). No significant difference was detected in the Parenting Scale total score (0.0, 95% Cl -0.1 to 0.1; P=.50), while DASS-21 total score differed nearly significantly (2.5, 95% Cl 0.0-5.1; P=.05), indicating better improvement in the implementation group. Conclusions: The internet-based and telephone-assisted SFSW parent training intervention was effectively implemented in real-world settings.

Effectiveness of art-based distraction in reducing pain and anxiety of hospitalized children during cannulation procedure: A randomized controlled trial,Not mental health,"Suleman, SK; Atrushi, A; Enskär, K",BELITUNG NURSING JOURNAL,2022,"Background: Peripheral venous cannulation (PIVC) is one of the most common needle procedures associated with the therapies of pediatric patients, which causes pain and anxiety in children. Trace Image and Coloring for Kids-Book (TICK-B) is one of the arts-based interventions to relieve pain and anxiety, but none of the existing studies use the TICK-B to decrease children's pain intensity and anxiety levels during PICV. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Trace Image and Coloring for Kids-Book (TICK-B) in decreasing children's pain and anxiety during PIVC. Methods: A parallel, randomized, double-blind controlled trial was used in this study. Children aged 6-12 years were randomly allocated to one of two groups: intervention or control. The intervention group (n = 48) received the TICK-B during the PIVC, compared to no intervention in the control group (n = 52). The children, their parents, and an observer nurse rated outcomes 1-2 min after completion of the procedure. The patients in both groups were similar in age, gender, duration of hospitalization, injections, mother's age, and education. Faces Pain ScaleRevised (FPS-R), Children's Fear Scale (CFS), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) were used to measure pain and anxiety. Paired and independent t-tests were used for data analysis. Results: Patients in the intervention group reported significantly reduced pain levels than those in the control group (p <0.001), as reported by children (3.08 vs. 7.06), parents (3.08 vs. 7.13), and the observer nurse (3.06 vs. 7.13), respectively.

Effectiveness of diabetes self-management education via a smartphone application in insulin treated type 2 diabetes patients - design of a randomised controlled trial (TRIGGER study'),Not Multi User,"Boels, AM; Rutten, G; Zuithoff, N; de Wit, A; Vos, R",BMC ENDOCRINE DISORDERS,2018,"BackgroundHealth care providers aim to stimulate self-management in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients. However, they have a limited number of patient contacts to do this. With the growing number of T2DM patients, innovative and cost-effective interventions to promote self-management are needed. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of diabetes self-management education via a smartphone app in T2DM patients on insulin therapy.MethodsNon-blinded two-arm multi-centre randomised controlled superiority trial with parallel-groups and equal randomisation (TRIGGER study'). Eligible patients are 40-70years, on insulin therapy since at least 3 months, with HbA1c >53mmol/mol (>7%). In total 228 patients will be recruited. The intervention group (n=114) will receive diabetes self-management education via a smartphone app to trigger diabetes self-management: unidirectional text messages, free of charge, evidence and psychological theory based, with regard to dietary habits, physical activity, hypoglycaemia and glucose variability. Patients choose their preferred frequency (two to six times per week), topics (two or three additionally to hypoglycaemia, which is an obligatory topic), and duration (6 or 9 months). The control group (n=114) will receive care-as-usual. The primary study endpoint is the HbA1c level after a follow-up of 6 months.

Effectiveness of dyadic psychoeducational intervention for stroke survivors and family caregivers on functional and psychosocial health: A systematic review and meta-analysis,Not mental health,"Mou, HY; Wong, MS; Chien, WT",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES,2021,"Objectives: Stroke is the third leading cause of disability worldwide, influencing the whole family's health and well-being. Dyadic (i.e., stroke survivor and family caregiver) psychoeducational intervention is a potential alternative to disease management and support, targeting at the dyads of stroke survivors and their caregivers as active participants in partnership. This review aimed to evaluate the current evidence on supporting the dyadic psychoeducational intervention for the functional and psychosocial health of stroke survivors' and their family caregivers. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis Data sources: Nine English databases (Cochrane Library, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, British Nursing Index, PubMed, Web of Science and Digital Dissertation Consortium) and two Chinese databases (CNKI and Wanfang) were searched to identify eligible studies published from their inception to April 2020. Additional relevant studies were identified from the reference lists and bibliographies of the identified articles and a manual search of relevant journals. Review methods: Studies were searched using keywords based on the 'PICOS' framework. The eligibility of individual full-text articles was independently assessed by two reviewers in accordance with the selection criteria. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0. The main outcomes were subjected to meta-analysis whenever possible; otherwise, narrative syntheses were conducted. Results: Eleven studies with 1769 stroke survivors and 1578 family caregivers were identified. The meta-analysis of pooled data suggested that the dyadic psychoeducational intervention had a significant immediate (<1 month) effect on family caregivers' burden (SMD = -0.25, 95% CI: -0.50 to -0.01, p = 0.04) and a long-term (>= 6 months) effect on survivors' quality of life (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI: -0.53 to -0.07, p = 0.01). Subgroup pooled analyses indicated that the interventions initiated in hospitals could significantly improve the survivors' functional independence immediately after intervention (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.72, p = 0.01). Conversely, the interventions initiated at home did not significantly affect this functional outcome. Conclusions: This review supports the notion that the dyadic psychoeducational intervention can be effective in improving the stroke survivors' functional independence and their family caregivers' burden for a short period and the survivors' quality of life in the long run. However, its effectiveness is not conclusive because other psychosocial health outcomes for the stroke survivors and their family caregivers have not yet been found to significantly improve after intervention. Therefore, further large-scale randomised controlled trials with a high-quality design are warranted to evaluate their effectiveness in diverse functional and psychosocial health outcomes for stroke survivors and their family caregivers.

These barriers may be overcome by using mobile health services (mHealth). To examine the effectiveness of mHealth professional consultation services in preventing postpartum depressive symptoms in real-world settings, we conducted this randomized controlled trial in Japan, where universal free face-to-face perinatal care is available.MethodsThis study included 734 pregnant women living in Yokohama city who could communicate in Japanese, recruited at public offices and childcare support facilities. The participants were randomized to the mHealth group (intervention, n = 365), where they could use a free app-based mHealth consultation service with gynecologists/obstetricians, pediatricians, and midwives whenever and as many times as they wanted between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on weekdays throughout their pregnancy and postpartum periods (funded by the City of Yokohama government) or the usual care group (control, n = 369).

Effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention on psychotic symptoms for patients with schizophrenia: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,Other,"Liu, YC; Li, IL; Hsiao, FH",JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING,2021,"Aims: To evaluate the effects of mindfulness-based intervention on psychotic symptoms, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and rehospitalization. Design: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Data Sources: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, CINAHL, National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan, and Airiti Library were searched from their earliest available date up to April 2019. Review Methods: The guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration were followed to report this systematic review. Two authors conducted this meta-analysis independently. Results: Nine randomized controlled trials were included. Meta-analysis showed that mindfulness-based intervention significantly decreased psychotic symptoms, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depressive symptoms, and duration of rehospitalization among patients with schizophrenia, and that the reduction in negative symptoms lasted through short-term follow-up. The moderation analysis showed that significantly decreased positive symptoms occurred in the nurse-led intervention group, while no significant impact was found in the psychologist-led intervention group. Conclusion: The psychotic symptoms of the patients with schizophrenia are improved after mindfulness-based intervention and the effects on the negative symptoms can be maintained for at least 3 to 6 months. Mindfulness-based intervention provided by nurses produces more improvements in positive symptoms than intervention provided by psychologists.

Effectiveness of particulate nature of matter (PNM)-based intervention studies in improving academic performance: a meta-analysis study,Not mental health,"Calik, M; Ultay, N; Bag, H; Ayas, A",CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,2023,"Through a meta-analysis, this study examines how effective particulate nature of matter (PNM)-based intervention studies are at improving academic performance. Well-known databases (e.g., ERIC, Springer Link, Taylor & Francis, and ScienceDirect) were used to look for the PNM-based intervention studies via specific keyword patterns. Also, a manual search of related journals and dissertations was conducted to find any missing papers. Subsequently, this meta-analysis included 66 papers (44 dissertations, 21 articles, and one proceeding) published from 1992 to 2022. All statistical data from the papers were initially inserted into an Excel sheet and then imported into comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) statistics software to calculate Hedges' g values. The findings indicated that the overall effect-size for the random-effects model was 0.90, which means that the PNM-based intervention studies have a large effect for academic performance. Furthermore, it was revealed that moderator variables, namely educational level and type of intervention, positively affected participants' PNM-based academic performance (p < 0.05). In light of the findings, it can be concluded that the PNM-based intervention studies are effective at improving the participants' academic performance. Moreover, given the findings regarding educational level, it can be deduced that K-8 students are able to learn the fundamental features or dimensions of the PNM. Since the meta-analysis includes few extreme values, further research should be undertaken to test the effectiveness of the intervention types on academic performance. Furthermore, the current study excluded a notable number of papers because they lacked sufficient data; therefore, science researchers should take care to include sufficient data or effect-size value for their papers to facilitate dissemination, generalization and comparison of their results.",10.1039/d3rp00027c,wos,Education & Educational Research,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1039/d3rp00027c)

Effectiveness of the Minder Mobile Mental Health and Substance Use Intervention for University Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Vereschagin M, Wang AY, Richardson CG, Xie H, Munthali RJ, Hudec KL, Leung C, Wojcik KD, Munro L, Halli P, Kessler RC, Vigo DV.",J Med Internet Res,2024,"Background:
University attendance represents a transition period for students that often coincides with the emergence of mental health and substance use challenges. Digital interventions have been identified as a promising means of supporting students due to their scalability, adaptability, and acceptability. Minder is a mental health and substance use mobile app that was codeveloped with university students.

Objective:
This study aims to examine the effectiveness of the Minder mobile app in improving mental health and substance use outcomes in a general population of university students.

Methods:
A 2-arm, parallel-assignment, single-blinded, 30-day randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate Minder using intention-to-treat analysis. In total, 1489 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention (n=743, 49.9%) or waitlist control (n=746, 50.1%) condition. The Minder app delivers evidence-based content through an automated chatbot and connects participants with services and university social groups. Participants are also assigned a trained peer coach to support them. The primary outcomes were measured through in-app self-assessments and included changes in general anxiety symptomology, depressive symptomology, and alcohol consumption risk measured using the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder scale, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and US Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test–Consumption Scale, respectively, from baseline to 30-day follow-up. Secondary outcomes included measures related to changes in the frequency of substance use (cannabis, alcohol, opioids, and nonmedical stimulants) and mental well-being. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to examine each outcome.

Results:
In total, 79.3% (589/743) of participants in the intervention group and 83% (619/746) of participants in the control group completed the follow-up survey. The intervention group had significantly greater average reductions in anxiety symptoms measured using the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder scale (adjusted group mean difference=−0.85, 95% CI −1.27 to −0.42; P<.001; Cohen d=−0.17) and depressive symptoms measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (adjusted group mean difference=−0.63, 95% CI −1.08 to −0.17; P=.007; Cohen d=−0.11). A reduction in the US Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test–Consumption Scale score among intervention participants was also observed, but it was not significant (P=.23). Statistically significant differences in favor of the intervention group were found for mental well-being and reductions in the frequency of cannabis use and typical number of drinks consumed. A total of 77.1% (573/743) of participants in the intervention group accessed at least 1 app component during the study period.

Conclusions:
In a general population sample of university students, the Minder app was effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, with provisional support for increasing mental well-being and reducing the frequency of cannabis and alcohol use. These findings highlight the potential ability of e-tools focused on prevention and early intervention to be integrated into existing university systems to support students’ needs.

Effectiveness of the Unified Protocol for the transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders in online and group format in Argentina: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Other,"Celleri, M; Cremades, CF; Etchevers, MJ; Garay, CJ",TRIALS,2023,"Background The Unified Protocol (UP) is a transdiagnostic intervention based on emotional regulation for the treatment of emotional disorders. Its application in individual and group formats has been studied worldwide, obtaining similar results to specific protocols but with a lower drop-out rate and improving the cost-benefit ratio, since a larger number of patients can benefit from it. Moreover, the inclusion of digital technologies in psychotherapy aims to improve the accessibility of treatments, especially since the pandemic of COVID-19 that forced the implementation of treatments through teletherapy increasing its use. To date, no studies have been carried out in Argentina on the application of the UP in a group format and through teletherapy. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of the UP in a group format and through teletherapy in the Argentine population.Methods A parallel-group, controlled, randomized trial, with pre-post and repeated follow-up measures intergroup design will be conducted. One hundred eighty patients will be randomized to one of the following conditions: an online, group-based UP intervention or a waiting list. The Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Beck Anxiety Inventory will be used to compare primary outcomes and the Beck Hopelessness Scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale, and Multicultural Quality of Life Index will be administered for secondary outcomes at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months follow-up.

"Effectiveness of virtual reality intervention on reducing the pain, anxiety and fear of needle-related procedures in paediatric patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis",Not Multi User,"Gao, Y; Xu, YW; Liu, NQ; Fan, L",JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING,2023,"Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) intervention in the management of pain, anxiety and fear in paediatric patients undergoing needle-related procedures. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources A librarian-designed search of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, CBM, CNKI, and Wanfang databases was conducted to identify research articles in English or Chinese on RCTs up to February 28, 2022. Review methods Two researchers independently screened eligible articles. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. A fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis model was used to determine the pooled mean difference based on the results of the heterogeneity test. Results A total of 2269 articles were initially screened. The meta-analysis included data from 27 studies representing 2224 participants. Compared with the non-VR group, the VR intervention group significantly reduced pain, anxiety, and fear in paediatric patients who underwent puncture-related procedures. Subgroup analysis showed that VR has advantages over conventional and other distraction methods. Conclusion Paediatric patients undergoing needle-related procedures would benefit from VR interventions for pain, anxiety and fear management. Impact VR intervention has the potential to reduce pain, anxiety and fear in paediatric patients undergoing puncture-related procedures. Future clinical interventions could incorporate VR into puncture procedures as an effective method to reduce negative emotions in children eligible for VR distractions.

Effectivity of a mHealth intervention for individuals with obesity: a study protocol for a controlled intervention study,Other,"Fritsch, J; Feil, K; Weyland, S; Schmidt, D; Jekauc, D",BMC SPORTS SCIENCE MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION,2021,"Background Obesity is considered an epidemic problem with an increasing number of individuals affected. The physical and psychological complaints associated with obesity point to the importance of implementing effective interventions. Innovative mHealth applications appear to be promising in helping provide a continuous and flexible support during the intervention. Since research on mHealth interventions is still relatively sparse, the main goal of the current study is to assess the effectiveness of an mHealth obesity intervention in terms of weight reduction, health behaviours as well as health-related quality of life. In addition, the study aims to investigate various psychological explicit and implicit processes associated with physical activity behaviour. Methods The study includes quantitative and qualitative methods. Regarding the quantitative methods, the goal is to recruit up to 450 individuals at baseline in different obesity centres across Germany with some of these centres offering an mHealth intervention. All individuals who agree to take part in the mHealth intervention will be assigned to the intervention group, while all other individuals will be assigned to the control group. The mHealth obesity intervention consists of three stays at an obesity centre, with approximately six months between stays during which patients are supported by the digital platform CASPAR. The study includes three measurements with a baseline measurement and two follow-up measurements, one after six months and one after twelve months. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, body weight, physical activity behaviour, eating behaviour as well as health related quality of life will be assessed. In addition, motivation, intentions, self-efficacy, enjoyment, and habit will be used to assess the psychological processes related with physical activity behaviour. A multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measurement and latent growth curve models will be used to compare the development of the variables within the two groups. In relation to the qualitative methods, interviews with individuals of the intervention group will be conducted to shed light on the applicability, acceptance, and usability of the mHealth intervention. Discussion This study may provide a valuable insight into the potential of mHealth obesity interventions and the psychological processes related to physical activity behaviour.

Effects of Mobile Mindfulness Meditation on the Mental Health of University Students: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,Other,"Chen, B; Yang, T; Xiao, L; Xu, CX; Zhu, CQ",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Mobile mindfulness meditation (MMM) is a mindfulness meditation intervention implemented using mobile devices such as smartphones and apps. MMM has been used to help manage the mental health of university students. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of MMM on the mental health of university students in the areas of stress, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, well-being, and resilience. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of MMM on the mental health of university students. This study followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. An electronic literature search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases, from inception to July 16, 2021. This study was conducted to identify studies that reported the effects of MMM on the primary outcomes including stress, anxiety, and depression, and on the secondary outcomes including mindfulness, well-being, and resilience. Two reviewers retrieved articles, evaluated quality, and extracted data independently. The methodological quality of the selected studies was determined using the Cochrane criteria for risk-of-bias assessment. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes were calculated. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were performed for results with high heterogeneity. The RevMan version 5.3 was used to perform meta-analysis. Results: A total of 10 studies, including 958 university students, were selected for this meta-analysis. Results of the primary outcome showed that the MMM groups were more effective than the control groups in decreasing stress (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.23; P<.001) and alleviating anxiety (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.09; P=.004). However, there was no difference between the MMM groups and the control groups in depression (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.03; P=.11). The use of either waitlist control or traditional face-to-face intervention in the control group was identified as the source of heterogeneity. Specifically, the waitlist control subgroup (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.13; P=.002) was superior when compared with the face-to-face subgroup (SMD 0.29, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.59; P=.06). Results of the secondary outcome showed that the MMM groups were more effective than the control groups in enhancing well-being (SMD 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.50; P=.003) and improving mindfulness (SMD 2.66, 95% CI 0.77-4.55; P=.006). Whether commercial sponsorship was obtained was considered as the source of heterogeneity. The without company support group (SMD 17.60, 95% CI 11.32-23.87; P<.001) was superior to the with company support group (SMD 1.17, 95% CI -0.82 to 3.15; P=.25) in raising the level of mindfulness. However, there was no difference between the MMM and control groups in resilience (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.15; P=.59).

However, no previous research has been conducted to monitor possible changes in APP levels of birds in response to prelay vaccinations of various live attenuated Mycoplasma gallisepticum vaccines in conjunction with their subsequent use as an overlay vaccine during the production period. Serum concentrations of the APP, alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP), were determined on d 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after subjecting commercial laying hens to one of the following treatments at 10 wk of age (woa): 1) control (no vaccination); 2) ts-11 strain M. gallisepticum (ts11MG) vaccination; 3) M. gallisepticum-bacterin (MGBac) vaccination; and 4) ts11MG and MGBac combination (ts11MG & MGBac) vaccination. Furthermore, at 45 woa, the birds in half of the units assigned to each treatment group were vaccinated with high-passage F-strain M. gallisepticum (HpFMG). Birds in treatment 1 that were (single control) and were not (double control) vaccinated with HpFMG, and birds in treatments 2, 3, and 4 that were vaccinated with HpFMG were further tested during lay on d 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after vaccination. On d 7, 14, and 28 postvaccination at 10 woa, the ts11MG & MGBac, ts11MG, and MGBac group AGP concentrations were not different from one another, but all were higher than those in the control group. Similarly, on d 3, 7, and 14 postvaccination, the single control, and the MGBac ts11MG, and ts11MG & MGBac treatment groups that were later vaccinated with HpFMG at 45 woa, were not different, but all were higher than that in the double control group. In conclusion, elevated circulation AGP concentrations may be used to detect and confirm subclinical infections in pullets up to 28 d after having been vaccinated with ts11MG, MGBac, or their combination. Furthermore, in association with depressed performance, elevated serum AGP concentrations in layers may be used to confirm HpFMG infections up to 28 d after its use as a vaccine.",10.3382/ps.2014-03906,"pubmed, wos",Agriculture,alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein; acute phase protein; Mycoplasma gallisepticum; layer; vaccine,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2014-03906)

Aim: The present study aimed to determine the effects of patient education and distraction using virtual reality (VR) on pre-operative anxiety and post-operative pain in patients undergoing LC. Method: This randomized clinical trial included 150 patients in the surgery wards of educational hospitals in Mashhad, Iran, in 2020. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups of education, distraction, and control. The education and distraction groups watched two five-minute animations and three 360-degree images of nature using VR glasses 2 hours before and 4 hours after the surgery, respectively. On the other hand, the control group received routine care. Anxiety was measured using Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory before and half an hour after the intervention. Moreover, the pain was measured using the visual analog scale and McGill Pain Questionnaire. Results: The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the two VR groups regarding the preoperative anxiety mean scores, compared with the control group (p < .001). Furthermore, a significant reduction was observed in post-operative pain scores of patients in the two intervention groups compared with the control group (p = .001).

Despite the growing use of mobile phone apps in medical settings for improving health, evidence supporting their effectiveness in the psychoeducation of patients with breast cancer is rarely available. Objective: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of psychoeducational interventions on anxiety and self-esteem in women with breast cancer using a mobile app and an online support group. Methods: An unblinded randomized controlled trial based on mobile phones was conducted in Shiraz, Iran. A research assistant recruited 82 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer aged 20 to 60 years were from clinics during a face-to-face visit at the point of care and randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=41) and a wait-list control group (n=41) through blocked randomization. The intervention group received psychoeducational interventions through a mobile phone app and participated in nurse-assisted online mobile support sessions for a total four weeks, whereas the control group was put on a waiting list. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) were used to measure the levels of anxiety and self-esteem as the main outcomes at baseline and one week after the intervention. Results: A total of 82 patients with a mean age of 46.45 (SD 9.29) years recruited in Winter 2016 were randomly assigned to a wait-list control group (n=41) and intervention group (n=41). Five patients dropped out for different reasons. Comparing the postintervention mean scores of anxiety and its subscales using the independent t test showed statistically significant differences between the mobile psychoeducation group and controls (P<.001). The paired t test used to compare the postintervention mean scores of anxiety with its preintervention scores in the intervention group showed significant reductions in the scores of anxiety (95% CI -17.44 to -8.90, P<.001, d=1.02) and its two subscales (state anxiety: 95% CI -9.20 to -4.21, P<.001, d=0.88 and trait anxiety: 95% CI -8.50 to -4.12, P<.001, d=0.94). Comparing the postintervention mean scores of self-esteem showed statistically insignificant differences between the control and intervention groups (16.87 vs 17.97, P=.24). In contrast with the controls, using the paired t test showed that the increase in the postintervention mean scores of self-esteem were statistically significant in the intervention group compared with the preintervention scores (mean difference 2.05, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.82, P<.001). Conclusions: This study demonstrated the key role of mobile apps in decreasing anxiety and improving self-esteem in women with breast cancer through psychoeducational interventions.

Program A showed nonsignificant trend (d=0.13; 95% CI -0.014 to 0.41; P=.07) toward improved engagement at 3 months. Neither program achieved effectiveness at the 7-month follow-up. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that a fixed order (program B) delivery of a smartphone-based stress management program was effective in improving work engagement in nurses in Vietnam However, the effect was small and only temporary. Further improvement of this program is required to achieve a greater effect size and more sustained, longer lasting impact on work engagement.",10.2196/20445,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,stress management; mental health; occupational health; digital health; workplace; LMICs; South-East Asia; health care professionals,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/20445)
"Effects of Stereoscopic Viewing on Presence, Anxiety, and Cybersickness in a Virtual Reality Environment for Public Speaking",Not Multi User,"Ling, Y; Brinkman, WP; Nefs, HT; Qu, C; Heynderickx, I",PRESENCE-TELEOPERATORS AND VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS,2012,"In this study, we addressed the effect of stereoscopy on presence, anxiety, and cybersickness in a virtual public speaking world, and investigated the relationships between these three variables. Our results question the practical relevance of applying stereoscopy in head-mounted displays (HMDs) for virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) in a virtual public speaking world. In VRET, feelings of presence improve the efficacy (B. K. Wiederhold & M. D. Wiederhold, 2005). There are reports of a relatively large group of dropouts during VRET at low levels of presence in the virtual environment (Krijn, Emmelkamp, Olafsson, & Biemond, 2004). Therefore, generating an adequate level of presence is essential for the success of VRET. In this study, 86 participants were recruited and they were immersed in the virtual public speaking world twice: once with stereoscopic rendering and once without stereoscopic rendering. The results showed that spatial presence was significantly improved by adding stereoscopy, but no difference for reported involvement or realism was found. The heart rate measurements also showed no difference between stereoscopic and nonstereoscopic viewing. Participants reported similar anxiety feelings about their talk and similar level of cybersickness in both viewing modes. Even though spatial presence was significantly improved, the size of statistical effect was relatively small. Our results therefore suggest that stereoscopic rendering may not be of practical importance for VRET in public speaking settings.",10.1162/PRES_a_00111,wos,Computer Science,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1162/PRES_a_00111)
Effects of Using a Text Message Intervention on Psychological Constructs and the Association Between Changes to Psychological Constructs and Medication Adherence in People With Type 2 Diabetes: Results From a Randomized Controlled Feasibility Study,Not Multi User,"Bartlett, YK; Farmer, A; Newhouse, N; Miles, L; Kenning, C; French, DP",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Poor adherence to oral medications is common in people with type 2 diabetes and can lead to an increased chance of health complications. Text messages may provide an effective delivery method for an intervention; however, thus far, the majority of these interventions do not specify either a theoretical basis or propose specific mechanisms of action. This makes it hard to determine how and whether an intervention is having an effect. The text messages included in the current intervention have been developed to deliver specific behavior change techniques. These techniques are the active ingredients of the intervention and were selected to target psychological constructs identified as predictors of medication adherence. Objective: There are 2 aims of this study: (1) to assess whether a text message intervention with specified behavior change techniques can change the constructs that predict medication adherence behaviors in people with type 2 diabetes and (2) to assess whether changes to psychological constructs are associated with changes in self-reported medication adherence. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled, 6-month feasibility trial. Adults prescribed oral medication for type 2 diabetes (N=209) were recruited from general practice and randomized to either receive a text message-based intervention or care as usual. Data were analyzed with repeated measures analysis of covariance and Spearman rho correlation coefficients. Results: For 8 of the 14 constructs that were measured, a significant time-by-condition interaction was found: necessity beliefs, intention, maintenance self-efficacy, recovery self-efficacy, action control, prompts and cues, social support, and satisfaction with experienced consequences all increased in the intervention group compared to the control group. Changes in action self-efficacy, intention, automaticity, maintenance self-efficacy, and satisfaction with experienced consequences were positively associated with changes in self-reported medication adherence. Conclusions: A relatively low-cost, scalable, text message-only intervention targeting medication adherence using behavior change techniques can influence psychological constructs that predict adherence. Not only do these constructs predict self-reported medication adherence, but changes in these constructs are correlated with changes in self-reported medication adherence. These findings support the promise of text message-based interventions for medication adherence in this population and suggest likely mechanisms of action.",10.2196/30058,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,medication adherence; type 2 diabetes mellitus; behavior change techniques; text messaging; feasibility studies; diabetes; medication; digital health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/30058)
Effects of Video-Based Patient Education and Consultation on Unplanned Health Care Utilization and Early Recovery After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery (IMPROVED): Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"van Steenbergen, G; van Veghel, D; van Lieshout, D; Sperwer, M; ter Woorst, J; Dekker, L",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Health care utilization after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is high and is partly of an unplanned nature. eHealth applications have been proposed to reduce care consumption, which involve and assist patients in their recovery. In this way, health care expenses could be reduced and quality of care could be improved. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate if an eHealth program can reduce unplanned health care utilization and improve mental and physical health in the first 6 weeks after CABG surgery. Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was performed, in which patients scheduled for nonacute CABG surgery were included from a single center in the Netherlands between February 2020 and October 2021. Participants in the intervention group had, alongside standard care, access to an eHealth program consisting of online education videos and video consultations developed in conjunction with the Dutch Heart Foundation. The control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the volume and costs of a composite of unplanned health care utilization, including emergency department visits, outpatient clinic visits, rehospitalization, patient-initiated telephone consultations, and visits to a general practitioner, measured using the Medical Technology Assessment Medical Consumption Questionnaire Patient-reported anxiety and recovery were also assessed. Intention-to-treat and users-only analyses were used. Results: During the study period, 280 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated at a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or control group. The intention-to-treat analysis consisted of 136 and 135 patients in the intervention and control group, respectively. At 6 weeks, the primary endpoint had occurred in 43 of 136 (31.6%) patients in the intervention group and in 61 of 135 (45.2%) patients in the control group (hazard ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.92).

Aim: This study aims to analyze the effects of virtual reality (VR) interventions on some of the parameters of normal labor. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Method: Higher Education Council National Thesis Center, Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials that administered VR to the intervention group but not to the control group and were published through January 2022. RevMan software was used to analyze the meta-analysis data. Pain, anxiety, satisfaction, and the duration of the first and second stages of labor were assessed as outcomes of normal labor. Results: Seven randomized controlled trials, with a total of 756 women in total, met the inclusion criteria. Virtual reality interventions significantly reduced pain scores when cervical dilatation was <= 4 cm (MD =-0.43, 95% expansion here (CI [-0.65,-0.21], p <.001) and >= 9 cm (SMD =-1.91, 95% CI [-2.56, - 1.26], p <.001). Anxiety scores significantly decreased (SMD = -1.08, 95% CI [-1.75, 0.41], p <.001), and childbirth satisfaction significantly increased (MD = 11.24, 95% CI [2.17, 20.30], p <.001) in the VR intervention groups. Finally, when compared to the control groups, the duration of the first stage of labor (SMD = -0.53, 95% CI [-0.83, -0.22], p <.01) and the second stage of labor (MD = -0.39, 95% CI [-0.76, -0.02], p =.001) were significantly decreased in the VR intervention groups.

Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology with the potential to improve overall well-being, quality of life (QoL), muscle activity and balance. Our study aimed to determine the influence of VR sessions on the QoL, happiness, and functional fitness components of an elderly cohort. Methods: A non-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted. Sixty participants, who visited the active ageing center at the university were randomized into two groupsintervention and control. The intervention group received VR experience sessions for 15 min twice a week for a duration of 6 weeks, while the control group received no sessions. Participants filled out a questionnaire for QoL assessment and happiness assessment. They were also tested for several functional fitness components. Both questionnaires and fitness tests were conducted at the beginning and at the end of study. Results: QoL improved by some metrics assessed (Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression). Happiness significantly improved in the intervention group relative to the control group. Among the functional fitness tests, the back scratch test 1st and back scratch test 2nd were measured to be significantly improved in the intervention group in comparison to control group. Conclusions: VR sessions have potential to influence the well-being and functional fitness of older adults and further support the process of healthy and active ageing. Future considerations could focus on supporting more physical and psychological aspects of the older people through VR content. Trial registration: NCT04166747. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the objective of this manuscript is to compare the effects of VR versus exercise treatment on pain intensity, conditioned pain modulation (CPM), temporal summation (TS) and functional and somatosensory outcomes in patients with non-specific chronic neck pain (NS-CNP).Methods: A single-blinded, randomized clinical trial was carried out. A total sample of 44 patients with NS-CNP was randomized into a VR treatment group or neck exercises group. The intervention consisted of two treatment sessions per week, for four weeks and eight sessions. Four measurement moments (at baseline, immediately, 1 month, and 3 months after intervention) were considered.

Effects of Visual and Audiovisual Distraction on Pain and Anxiety Among Patients Undergoing Colonoscopy,Not Multi User,"Jiang, XL; Li, XL; Zhou, HL",GASTROENTEROLOGY NURSING,2015,"The aim of this study was to test the effects of visual and audiovisual distraction on pain, anxiety, and procedure tolerance among patients undergoing colonoscopy. A prospective, randomized, controlled design was used with 180 consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy. Subjects were randomly allocated into 3 groups: Group A received visual distraction, Group B received audiovisual distraction, Group C with routine care. Outcome variables included pain, anxiety, and willingness to undergo colonoscopy again if the procedure was to be repeated. No signifi cant difference was found on the pain scores of the 3 groups. However, when groups A and B were further divided into groups A1, A2, A3 (low-, middle-, high-involvement groups), and B1, B2, B3 (low-, middle-, high-involvement groups) according to the level of distraction involvement, signifi cant differences in pain scores were found between 7 groups (A1 and A3, A2 and A3, A1 and B3, A2 and B3, A3 and C, B1 and B3, B3 and C). The pain score of Group A3 was signifi cantly lower than those of groups A1, A2, and C, and the pain score of Group B3 was signifi cantly lower than those of groups B1 and C.

Effects of a Digital Musculoskeletal Acute Care Program on Chronic Pain Prevention: An Observational Study with Nonparticipant Comparison Group,Not mental health,"Hong, MY; Topete, M; Yang, M; Bailey, JF",JOURNAL OF PAIN RESEARCH,2022,"Background: There is limited research on whether digital interventions can prevent acute or subacute pain from developing into chronic pain. This observational study's primary objective examined whether chronic pain was more likely to be prevented in digital acute MSK program participants than nonparticipants. An exploratory objective was time to pain relief for program participants versus nonparticipants.Patients and Methods: The intervention group participants conducted video visits with physical therapists and were recommended exercise therapies and educational articles delivered through an app dedicated to addressing musculoskeletal (MSK) needs. This study used a multidimensional approach incorporating pain, function, depression, and anxiety scores to determine whether chronic pain prevention was achieved at 12 weeks. Descriptive analyses, unadjusted, and adjusted logistic regression were conducted. Time-to-event analysis was performed to compare the time to pain relief between groups.Results: A total of 171 participants (intervention: 75, nonparticipants: 96) with baseline and 3, 6, and 12 week follow-up data were included in the sample. Baseline mean (SD) age was 44.2 (11.8) years and mean VAS pain was 43.3 (22.9), out of 100. Results showed significantly higher odds of achieving chronic pain prevention at 12 weeks in the intervention participants versus nonparticipants. After adjusting for age, pain region, registration month, number of weeks of pain experienced, and healthcare service use at 12 weeks, 20.5% of the intervention group and 5.5% of the nonparticipant group achieved chronic pain prevention. At 91 days, the probability of developing chronic pain was 77.7% for nonparticipants and 46.5% for intervention participants (p<0.001; Log rank test).Conclusion: A digital acute MSK program may help to prevent chronic pain from developing among those with acute and subacute MSK needs.

Findings on digitally supported mindfulness interventions among nurses working in acute inpatient care settings are heterogeneous, lack long-term follow-up, and do not assess adherence and acceptability. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and efficacy of a digitally supported mindfulness intervention designed to improve health-and work-related outcomes among nurses and nursing trainees working in acute inpatient care settings. Methods: We will conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial using a wait-list control group design. Randomization will be stratified by hospital and job status (nurse or nursing trainee). Recruitment will take place on the web and offline during the working hours of nurses and nursing trainees. The intervention group will receive a digitally supported mindfulness intervention, which will comprise an app, 2 web-based workshops, and a workbook, whereas the wait-list control group will be scheduled to receive the same intervention 14 weeks later. The 2 web-based workshops will be led by a certified mindfulness-based stress reduction trainer. Nurses will use the app and the workbook independently.

Effects of a Mindfulness Meditation App on Subjective Well-Being: Active Randomized Controlled Trial and Experience Sampling Study,Not Multi User,"Walsh, KM; Saab, BJ; Farb, NAS",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2019,"Background: Mindfulness training (MT) includes a variety of contemplative practices aimed at promoting intentional awareness of experience, coupled with attitudes of nonjudgment and curiosity. Following the success of 8-week, manualized group interventions, MT has been implemented in a variety of modalities, including smartphone apps that seek to replicate the success of group interventions. However, although smartphone apps are scalable and accessible to a wider swath of population, their benefits remain largely untested. Objective: This study aimed to investigate a newly developed MT app called Wildflowers, which was codeveloped with the laboratory for use in mindfulness research. It was hypothesized that 3 weeks of MT through this app would improve subjective well-being, attentional control, and interoceptive integration, albeit with weaker effects than those published in the 8 week, manualized group intervention literature. Methods: Undergraduate students completed 3 weeks of MT with Wildflowers (n=45) or 3 weeks of cognitive training with a game called 2048 (n=41). State training effects were assessed through pre- and postsession ratings of current mood, stress level, and heart rate. Trait training effects were assessed through pre- and postintervention questionnaires canvassing subjective well-being and behavioral task measures of attentional control and interoceptive integration. State and trait training data were analyzed in a multilevel model using emergent latent factors (acceptance, awareness, and openness) to summarize the trait questionnaire battery. Results: Analyses revealed both state and trait effects specific to MT; participants engaging in MT demonstrated improved mood (r=.14) and a reduction of stress (r=-.13) immediately after each training session compared with before the training session and decreased postsession stress over 3 weeks (r=-.08). In addition, MT relative to cognitive training resulted in greater improvements in attentional control (r=-.24). Interestingly, both groups demonstrated increased subjective ratings of awareness (r=.28) and acceptance (r=.23) from pre- to postintervention, with greater changes in acceptance for the MT group trending (r=.21). Conclusions: MT, using a smartphone app, may provide immediate effects on mood and stress while also providing long-term benefits for attentional control. Although further investigation is warranted, there is evidence that with continued usage, MT via a smartphone app may provide long-term benefits in changing how one relates to their inner and outer experiences.",10.2196/10844,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,mindfulness; attention; mobile health; interoception; mood; stress; psychological,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/10844)
Effects of a Mindfulness Meditation Course on Learning and Cognitive Performance among University Students in Taiwan,Good,"Ching, HH; Koo, M; Tsai, TH; Chen, CY",EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,2015,"Mindfulness training has recently gained much research interest because of its putative benefits for both mental and physical health.

Effects of a Mobile and Web App (Thought Spot) on Mental Health Help-Seeking Among College and University Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Wiljer, D; Shi, J; Lo, B; Sanches, M; Hollenberg, E; Johnson, A; Abi-Jaoudé, A; Chaim, G; Cleverley, K; Henderson, J; Isaranuwatchai, W; Levinson, A; Robb, J; Wong, HW; Voineskos, A",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2020,"Background: Mental health disorders are the most prevalent health issues among postsecondary students, yet few solutions to this emerging crisis exist. While mobile health technologies are touted as promising solutions for the unmet mental health needs of these students, the efficacy of these tools remains unclear. In response to these gaps, this study evaluates Thought Spot, a mobile and web app created through participatory design research. Objective: The goal of the research is to examine the impact of Thought Spot on mental health and wellness help-seeking intentions, behaviors, attitudes, self-stigma, and self-efficacy among postsecondary students in Canada. Methods: A 2-armed randomized controlled trial involving students from three postsecondary institutions was conducted. Students were eligible if they were aged 17 to 29 years, enrolled in full-time or part-time studies, functionally competent in English, and had access to a compatible digital device. The usual care group received a mental health services information pamphlet. The intervention group received the Thought Spot app on their digital device. Thought Spot is a standalone app that allows users to add, review, and search crowdsourced information about nearby mental health and wellness services. Users can also track their mood on the app. Outcomes were self-assessed through questionnaires collected at baseline and 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome was change in formal help-seeking intentions from baseline to 6 months, measured by the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire. A mixed-effects model was used to compare the impact of usual care and intervention on the primary outcome (formal help-seeking intentions). Secondary outcomes included changes in informal help-seeking intentions and help-seeking behaviors, help-seeking attitudes, self-stigma, and self-efficacy. Results: A total of 481 students were randomized into two groups: 240 to usual care, and 241 to the intervention group. There were no significant differences in help-seeking intentions between the usual care and intervention groups over 6 months (F-2,F-877=0.85; P=.43, f=0.04). Both groups demonstrated similar increases in formal help-seeking intentions at 3 and 6 months (F-2,F-877=23.52; P<.001, f=0.21). Compared with males, females sought more help from formal resources (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.83, P=.001). Females were less likely to seek help from informal sources than males (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.73, P<.001). Conclusions: Prompting postsecondary students about mental health and help-seeking appears to increase help-seeking intentions. mHealth interventions may be as effective as information pamphlets in increasing formal help-seeking but may confer a small advantage in driving help-seeking from informal sources. Although there is enthusiasm, developers and health policy experts should exercise caution and thoroughly evaluate these types of digital tools.

"Effects of a Mobile-Based Intervention for Parents of Children With Crying, Sleeping, and Feeding Problems: Randomized Controlled Trial",Not Multi User,"Augustin, M; Licata-Dandel, M; Breeman, LD; Harrer, M; Bilgin, A; Wolke, D; Mall, V; Ziegler, M; Ebert, DD; Friedmann, A",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2023,"Background: Excessive crying, sleeping, and feeding problems in early childhood are major stressors that can result in parents feeling socially isolated and having low self-efficacy. Affected children are a risk group for being maltreated and developing emotional and behavioral problems. Thus, the development of an innovative and interactive psychoeducational app for parents of children with crying, sleeping, and feeding problems may provide low-threshold access to scientifically based information and reduce negative outcomes in parents and children. Objective: We aimed to investigate whether following the use of a newly developed psychoeducational app, the parents of children with crying, sleeping, or feeding problems experienced less parenting stress; gained more knowledge about crying, sleeping, and feeding problems; and perceived themselves as more self-effective and as better socially supported and whether their children's symptoms decreased more than those of the parents who did not use the app. Methods: Our clinical sample consisted of 136 parents of children (aged 0-24 months) who contacted a cry baby outpatient clinic in Bavaria (Southern Germany) for an initial consultation. Using a randomized controlled design, families were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (IG; 73/136, 53.7%) or a waitlist control group (WCG; 63/136, 46.3%) during the usual waiting time until consultation. The IG was given a psychoeducational app that included evidence-based information via text and videos, a child behavior diary function, a parent chat forum and experience report, tips on relaxation, an emergency plan, and a regional directory of specialized counseling centers. Outcome variables were assessed using validated questionnaires at baseline test and posttest. Both groups were compared at posttest regarding changes in parenting stress (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes, namely knowledge about crying, sleeping, and feeding problems; perceived self-efficacy; perceived social support; and child symptoms. Results: The mean individual study duration was 23.41 (SD 10.42) days. The IG reported significantly lower levels of parenting stress (mean 83.18, SD 19.94) after app use compared with the WCG (mean 87.46, SD 16.67; P=.03; Cohen d=0.23). Furthermore, parents in the IG reported a higher level of knowledge about crying, sleeping, and feeding (mean 62.91, SD 4.30) than those in the WCG (mean 61.15, SD 4.46; P<.001; Cohen d=0.38). No differences at posttest were found between groups in terms of parental efficacy (P=.34; Cohen d=0.05), perceived social support (P=.66; Cohen d=0.04), and child symptoms (P=.35; Cohen d=0.10). Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence of the efficacy of a psychoeducational app for parents with child crying, sleeping, and feeding problems. By reducing parental stress and increasing knowledge of children's symptoms, the app has the potential to serve as an effective secondary preventive measure. Additional large-scale studies are needed to investigate long-term benefits.",10.2196/41804,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,children; crying problems; sleeping problems; feeding problems; feeding; regulatory problems; intervention study; Mobile Health Care; health app; mobile app; patient education; psychoeducation; eHealth; mobile health; mHealth; parenting; baby; babies; sleep; crying; newborn; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/41804)
"Effects of a Rice-Farming Simulation Video Game on Nature Relatedness, Nutritional Status, and Psychological State in Urban-Dwelling Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Randomized Waitlist Controlled Trial",Not Multi User,"Lee, SL; Yuh, C; Shin, YB; Lee, HJ; Lee, YM; Lee, JS; Cho, CH",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2024,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, urban inhabitants faced significant challenges in maintaining connections with nature, adhering to nutritional guidelines, and managing mental well-being. Objective: Recognizing the urgent need for innovative approaches, this study was designed to explore the potential benefits of a specific digital intervention, the rice-farming simulation game Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin, for nature relatedness, nutritional behaviors, and psychological well-being. Methods: A total of 66 adults without any prior major psychiatric disorders residing in an urban area were recruited for the study. They were randomly assigned to 2 groups through block randomization: the immediate intervention group (IIG; 34/66, 52%) and the waitlist group (32/66, 48%). Participants in the IIG were instructed to play the game for at least 4 days per week for 3 weeks, with each session lasting from 30 minutes to 3 hours. Assessments were performed at baseline, week 1, and week 3. The Nature Relatedness Scale (NR) and Nutrition Quotient Scale were used to evaluate nature relatedness and nutritional state, respectively. Furthermore, psychological state was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF), Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale, Social Avoidance and Distress Scale, Toronto Alexithymia Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised, and Korean Resilience Quotient. Results: This study's results revealed significant time interactions between the IIG and waitlist group for both the total NR score (P=.001) and the score of the self subdomain of NR (P<.001), indicating an impact of the game on nature relatedness. No groupxtime interactions were found for the total Nutrition Quotient Scale and subdomain scores, although both groups showed increases from baseline. For psychological state, a significant groupxtime interaction was observed in the total WHOQOL-BREF score (P=.049), suggesting an impact of the game on quality of life. The psychological (P=.01), social (P=.003), and environmental (P=.04) subdomains of the WHOQOL-BREF showed only a significant time effect. Other psychological scales did not display any significant changes (all P>.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the rice-farming game intervention might have positive effects on nature relatedness, nature-friendly dietary behaviors, quality of life, anxiety, depression, interpersonal relationships, and resilience among urban adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of pronature games in confined urban environments provides valuable evidence of how digital technologies can be used to enhance urban residents' affinity for nature and psychological well-being.

Effects of a Self-Guided Transdiagnostic Smartphone App on Patient Empowerment and Mental Health: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Kerber, A; Beintner, I; Burchert, S; Knaevelsrud, C",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2023,"Background: Mental disorders impact both individuals and health systems. Symptoms and syndromes often remain undetected and untreated, resulting in chronification. Besides limited health care resources, within-person barriers such as the lack of trust in professionals, the fear of stigmatization, or the desire to cope with problems without professional help contribute to the treatment gap. Self-guided mental health apps may support treatment seeking by reducing within-person barriers and facilitating mental health literacy. Digital mental health interventions may also improve mental health related self-management skills and contribute to symptom reduction and the improvement of quality of life. Objective: This study aims to investigate the effects of a self-guided transdiagnostic app for mental health on help seeking, reduced stigma, mental health literacy, self-management skills, mental health symptoms, and quality of life using a randomized controlled design.Methods: Overall, 1045 participants (recruited via open, blinded, and web-based recruitment) with mild to moderate depression or anxiety-, sleep-, eating-, or somatization-related psychopathology were randomized to receive either access to a self-guided transdiagnostic mental health app (MindDoc) in addition to care as usual or care as usual only. The core features of the app were regular self-monitoring, automated feedback, and psychological courses and exercises. The coprimary outcomes were mental health literacy, mental health-related patient empowerment and self-management skills (MHPSS), attitudes toward help seeking, and actual mental health service use. The secondary outcomes were psychopathological symptom burden and quality of life. Data were collected at baseline and 8 weeks and 6 months after randomization. Treatment effects were investigated using analyses of covariance, including baseline variables as predictors and applying multiple imputation.Results: We found small but robust between-group effects for MHPSS (Cohen d=0.29), symptoms burden (Cohen d=0.28), and quality of life (Cohen d=0.19) 8 weeks after randomization. The effects on MHPSS were maintained at follow-up. Follow-up assessments also showed robust effects on mental health literacy and preliminary evidence for the improvement of help seeking. Predictors of attrition were lower age and higher personality dysfunction. Among the non-attritors, predictors for deterioration were less outpatient treatment and higher initial symptom severity. Conclusions: A self-guided transdiagnostic mental health app can contribute to lasting improvements in patient empowerment. Symptoms of common mental disorders and quality of life improved faster in the intervention group than in the control group. Therefore, such interventions may support individuals with symptoms of 1 or more internalizing disorders, develop health-centered coping skills, prevent chronification, and accelerate symptom improvement. Although the effects for individual users are small and predictors of attrition and deterioration need to be investigated further, the potential public health impact of a self-guided intervention can be large, given its high scalability.Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00022531; https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00022531",10.2196/45068,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,patient empowerment; mental health-related self-management skills; help-seeking attitude; mental health literacy; internet-based interventions; unguided; self-guided; transdiagnostic mental health app,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/45068)
Effects of a Smartphone-Based Out-of-Hospital Screening App for Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia on Neonatal Readmission Rates and Maternal Anxiety: Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Yan, Q; Gong, YH; Luo, Q; Yin, XX; Yang, L; Wang, HL; Feng, J; Xing, KH; Huang, Y; Huang, CC; Fan, LC",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is one of the leading causes of neonatal readmission-especially severe hyperbilirubinemia and its complications-and it influences disease burden as well as neonatal and maternal health. Smartphones have been shown to have satisfactory accuracy in screening neonatal bilirubin levels, but the impact of this technology on neonatal health care service and maternal health outcomes is still unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a smartphone-based out-of-hospital neonatal jaundice screening program on neonatal readmission rates for jaundice and related maternal anxiety. Methods: This was a 2-arm, unblinded, randomized controlled trial with 30 days of intervention and follow-up periods. From August 2019 to August 2020, healthy mother-infant dyads were recruited on-site from 3 public hospitals in Hainan, China. Intervention group mothers used the smartphone app to routinely monitor neonatal jaundice at home under the web-based guidance of pediatricians. Control group participants received routine care. The primary study outcome was the neonatal readmission rate due to jaundice within 30 days of the first hospital discharge. The secondary outcome was the maternal anxiety score associated with neonatal jaundice. The data were collected through a self-assessed questionnaire. All participants were included in the analysis (intention-to-treat). Results: In this study, 1424 mother-infant dyads were recruited, comprising 1424 mothers and 1424 newborns. The median age of the mothers was 29 (IQR 26-32) years, and there were 714 (50.1%) male neonates. These mother-infant dyads were randomly assigned to the intervention group and the control group, with 712 dyads in each group; only 1187 of these dyads completed the follow-up. We found that the adjusted 30-day neonatal readmission rate due to jaundice reduced by 10.5% (71/605, 11.7% vs 141/582, 24.2%; 95% CI 5%-15.9%; odds ratio 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.5; P<.001) and the relevant maternal anxiety mean score decreased by 3.6 (95% CI -4.4 to -2.8; beta=-3.6, 95% CI -4.5 to -2.8; P<.001) in the intervention group compared to those in the routine care group. Conclusions: Our study shows that the smartphone-based out-of-hospital screening method for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia decreased the neonatal readmission rate within 30 days from the first discharge and improved maternal mental health to some degree, thus demonstrating the usefulness of this screening app for follow-up in pediatric care.",10.2196/37843,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,eHealth; mHealth; mobile apps; maternal anxiety; neonatal jaundice; neonatal readmission; neonatal screening; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/37843)
Effects of a Virtual Reality-Based Meditation Intervention on Anxiety and Depression Among Patients With Acute Leukemia During Induction Chemotherapy,Population,"Zhang, BX; Jin, XH; Kuang, XL; Shen, BY; Qiu, DR; Peng, JR; Chen, ER; Dai, XP; Chen, XL; Wong, CL",CANCER NURSING,2023,"Background Emerging evidence supports that virtual reality (VR)-based meditation interventions may improve anxiety and depression among patients with cancer. However, empirical studies involving patients with acute leukemia during induction chemotherapy are limited.This study aimed to examine the effects of VR-based meditation intervention on alleviating anxiety and depression and improving the quality of life among patients with acute leukemia during induction chemotherapy.This randomized controlled trial recruited 63 patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (received VR-based meditation for 20 min daily for 14 days) and a control group. Anxiety, depression, and quality of life were measured using the State Anxiety Inventory, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia Questionnaire, respectively. All outcomes were measured at baseline and post-intervention.Compared with patients in the control group, those in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in anxiety (P = .04) and improvement in quality of life (P = .04). However, no significant difference was noted in depression levels between groups (P = .09), although a decreasing trend was observed in the intervention group.Virtual reality-based meditation intervention effectively alleviated anxiety and improved the quality of life among acute leukemia patients during induction chemotherapy. Future randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are warranted.Virtual reality-based meditation can be applied in clinical practice virtually anytime and anywhere to provide a convenient intervention for anxiety reduction for acute leukemia patients during induction chemotherapy.Acute leukemia is a life-threatening malignant neoplasm of hematopoietic stem cells and is associated with poor prognosis.1 Once diagnosed, the acute and rapid nature of the disease requires emergent aggressive treatment, normally including 1 to 3 weeks of induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy, maintenance chemotherapy, and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.2,3The diagnosis and intensive treatment of acute leukemia usually leads to substantial psychological suffering, especially for the newly diagnosed patients who received induction chemotherapy.4 Previous studies reported high levels of anxiety (ranged from 20% to 46%) and depression (ranged from 17% to 54%) in these patients.5,6 Anxiety predicts patients' unfavorable survival status, thereby increasing their tendency to adopt a negative coping style, such as avoidance, to current problems.7 Higher levels of depression are associated with worsened perceptions of chemotherapy-related symptoms, hindering patients' adherence to continued systemic chemotherapy.8 Impaired psychological well-being is negatively correlated with lower quality of life (QOL) in patients with acute leukemia.9 Considering the high prevalence of anxiety and depression and their negative impact on patients, offering interventions for patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia is of utmost importance.Interventions aimed at relieving anxiety and depression during induction chemotherapy in acute leukemia patients include pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Owing to the potential risks of medication resistance and the possibility of recurrence after withdrawal of medication, nonpharmacological interventions such as exercise therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and mindfulness meditation therapy are given greater consideration.10-16 Exercises are reportedly effective in relieving negative emotions in acute leukemia patients10; however, a meta-analysis has highlighted that exercise has little effect on hospitalized patients.11 Moreover, acute leukemia patients are at high risk of infection, anemia, and hemorrhage because of myelosuppression after receiving induction chemotherapy, so acute leukemia patients need to be cautious when performing exercises during induction chemotherapy.Cognitive-behavioral therapy, which aims to change potentially unhealthy behaviors by helping patients correctly understand the disease, is extensively used in clinical practice.12-14 Studies have suggested that cognitive-behavioral therapy has positive effects in addressing cancer-related psychological problems and reducing anxiety and depression.13,14 However, some cancer patients may not benefit from correcting distress-related cognition through effort, which could further increase their suffering.15 Patients also tend to avoid receiving medical information to reduce the psychological burden caused by the disease.17Emerging evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation is adopted to relieve anxiety and depression in patients with acute leukemia.18 Mindfulness meditation is characterized by focusing on the present moment nonjudgmentally.19 It reduces the observation of negative states and maintains absent psychological responses to negative states, thereby relieving negative emotions,20 leading to the reduction of anxiety and depression.21 However, the effects of meditation interventions on patients with acute leukemia are inconsistent.18 This may be due to severe fatigue, pain, and other adverse effects caused by induction chemotherapy that distract patients from meditation activities. Furthermore, during induction chemotherapy, the meditative process can easily be interrupted by treatments and noisy ward environment. These conditions cause patients to have difficulty in focusing their attention and thus reduce the effects of mindfulness meditation. Therefore, strategies are needed to improve the attention of acute leukemia patients during induction chemotherapy.Virtual reality (VR) provides users with an immersive experience through human-computer interaction.22 A review showed that VR intervention is more effective compared with the control (ie, standard care) for anxiety and depression.23 By immersing into the joyful computer-generated VR environment, participants can effectively be distracted from the real world and focused on the VR content, so their anxiety and cancer-related symptoms are likely reduced.24-26 A previous study has shown that VR-based meditation intervention for 30 min can effectively improve sleep quality among patients in the intensive care unit, suggesting the feasibility of using VR-based meditation in hospitalized patients.27 In addition, VR-based meditation intervention for 10 min has effectively alleviated chronic pain and stress among veterans.28 Nevertheless, the effects of just one 10-min VR-based meditation intervention on psychological outcomes such as alleviating anxiety or depression are controversial. Moreover, the effects of VR-based meditation on reducing anxiety and depression in acute leukemia patients have not yet been explored. The Roy adaptation model (RAM) was adopted as the theoretical framework to guide this study.29 Cognitive and physiological regulators interact to foster adaptive or maladaptive responses. Physiological, self-concept, role function, and interdependence domains are defined as the models of physiological and cognitive processes. The maladaptive responses provide feedback to be the stressors and restart the physiological and cognitive processes.29 For patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia, symptoms caused by acute leukemia, adverse effects caused by induction chemotherapy, unfamiliarity with hospitalization procedures, and fear of death become the main stressors. These factors lead to an imbalance in adaptation manifesting in high levels of anxiety and depression among patients.6 In such circumstances, patients' adaptation strategies are impaired, and the efforts to adapt are inefficient, so intervention is needed. Meditation can enhance the cognitive reserve, and VR can potentially help patients focus on meditation and can aid the emotional activation of negative cognition and cognitive restructuring.22,30 Therefore, we hypothesized that a VR-based meditation intervention could promote patients' cognitive processes so that they can achieve adaptive outcomes. Consequently, anxiety and depression can be alleviated, and QOL can be improved.This study aimed to examine the effects of VR-based meditation intervention on alleviating anxiety and depression (primary outcomes) and improving QOL among patients with acute leukemia during induction chemotherapy.Background Emerging evidence supports that virtual reality (VR)-based meditation interventions may improve anxiety and depression among patients with cancer.

Consequently, anxiety and depression can be alleviated, and QOL can be improved.This study aimed to examine the effects of VR-based meditation intervention on alleviating anxiety and depression (primary outcomes) and improving QOL among patients with acute leukemia during induction chemotherapy.Background Emerging evidence supports that virtual reality (VR)-based meditation interventions may improve anxiety and depression among patients with cancer. However, empirical studies involving patients with acute leukemia during induction chemotherapy are limited.This study aimed to examine the effects of VR-based meditation intervention on alleviating anxiety and depression and improving the quality of life among patients with acute leukemia during induction chemotherapy.This randomized controlled trial recruited 63 patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (received VR-based meditation for 20 min daily for 14 days) and a control group. Anxiety, depression, and quality of life were measured using the State Anxiety Inventory, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia Questionnaire, respectively. All outcomes were measured at baseline and post-intervention.Compared with patients in the control group, those in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in anxiety (P = .04) and improvement in quality of life (P = .04). However, no significant difference was noted in depression levels between groups (P = .09), although a decreasing trend was observed in the intervention group.Virtual reality-based meditation intervention effectively alleviated anxiety and improved the quality of life among acute leukemia patients during induction chemotherapy. Future randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are warranted.Virtual reality-based meditation can be applied in clinical practice virtually anytime and anywhere to provide a convenient intervention for anxiety reduction for acute leukemia patients during induction chemotherapy.Acute leukemia is a life-threatening malignant neoplasm of hematopoietic stem cells and is associated with poor prognosis.1 Once diagnosed, the acute and rapid nature of the disease requires emergent aggressive treatment, normally including 1 to 3 weeks of induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy, maintenance chemotherapy, and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.2,3The diagnosis and intensive treatment of acute leukemia usually leads to substantial psychological suffering, especially for the newly diagnosed patients who received induction chemotherapy. 4 Previous studies reported high levels of anxiety (ranged from 20% to 46%) and depression (ranged from 17% to 54%) in these patients.5,6 Anxiety predicts patients' unfavorable survival status, thereby increasing their tendency to adopt a negative coping style, such as avoidance, to current problems.7 Higher levels of depression are associated with worsened perceptions of chemotherapy-related symptoms, hindering patients' adherence to continued systemic chemotherapy.8 Impaired psychological well-being is negatively correlated with lower quality of life (QOL) in patients with acute leukemia.9 Considering the high prevalence of anxiety and depression and their negative impact on patients, offering interventions for patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia is of utmost importance.Interventions aimed at relieving anxiety and depression during induction chemotherapy in acute leukemia patients include pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Owing to the potential risks of medication resistance and the possibility of recurrence after withdrawal of medication, nonpharmacological interventions such as exercise therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and mindfulness meditation therapy are given greater consideration.10-16 Exercises are reportedly effective in relieving negative emotions in acute leukemia patients10; ;",10.1097/NCC.0000000000001206,"pubmed, wos",Oncology; Nursing,Acute leukemia; Anxiety; Chemotherapy; Depression; Meditation; Virtual reality,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1097/NCC.0000000000001206)
Effects of a cognitive-behavioral exposure-based body image therapy for overweight females with binge eating disorder: a pilot study,Not Multi User,"Lewer, M; Kosfelder, J; Michalak, J; Schroeder, D; Nasrawi, N; Vocks, S",JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS,2017,"Background: Although not part of the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5, body image disturbance seems to be a relevant feature of Binge Eating Disorder (BED) as well as of other eating disorders such as Anorexia Nervosa (AN) or Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Hence, the aim of the present pilot study was to assess the changeability of body image disturbance in a sample of overweight females with BED by a cognitive-behavioral treatment, directly addressing body image disturbance. Method: Overweight females (N = 34) with BED were randomized to a manualized body image therapy or a waiting-list control group. The final sample consisted of n = 15 participants in the intervention group and n = 19 in the control group due to two drop-outs in the control condition. Before and after the intervention or the waiting period, respectively, participants filled out a questionnaire battery assessing several body image and eating disorder related features. To quantify the perceptual component of body image disturbance, a digital photo distortion technique based on a picture of each participant taken in a standardized suit was applied. Results: In a two-way ANOVA, significant Time x Group interactions were found for eating and shape concerns, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, depressiveness and low self-esteem. Follow-up t-tests indicated a significant symptom reduction of a generally high magnitude in the intervention group. No significant changes concerning body checking and the estimations of one's own real, felt and ideal body dimensions were found. Conclusion: The strong symptom reduction in the cognitive-affective component of body image disturbance indicates that an exposure-based cognitive-behavioral body image intervention is a promising treatment module for overweight females with BED, but future research with a larger sample size is needed to quantify possible changes in all components of body image.",10.1186/s40337-017-0174-y,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Psychiatry,Binge eating disorder; Body image disorder; Cognitive-behavioral therapy; Digital photo distortion technique; Exposure therapy,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40337-017-0174-y)

However, the effectiveness of smartphone-based videoconferencing programs in enhancing emotional status and quality of life has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate of the effect of a smartphone-based videoconferencing program on nursing home residents' feelings of loneliness, depressive symptoms and quality of life. Methods This study used a quasi-experimental research design. Older residents from seven nursing homes in Taiwan participated in this study. Nursing homes (NH) were randomly selected as sites for either the intervention group (5 NH) or the control group (2 NH); NH residents who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate. The intervention group was comprised of 32 participants; the control group was comprised of 30 participants. The intervention group interacted with their family members once a week for 6 months using a smartphone and a LINE application (app). Data were collected with self-report instruments: subjective feelings of loneliness, using the University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale; depressive symptoms, using the Geriatric Depression Scale; and quality of life using the SF-36. Data were collected at four time points (baseline, and at 1-month, 3-months and 6-months from baseline). Data were analysed using the generalized estimating equation approach. Results After the intervention, as compared to those in the control group, participants in interventional group had significant decreases in baseline loneliness scores at 1 months (beta = - 3.41, p < 0.001), 3 months (beta = - 5.96, p < 0.001), and 6 months (beta = - 7.50, p < 0.001), and improvements in physical role (beta = 36.49, p = 0.01), vitality (beta = 13.11, p < 0.001) and pain scores (beta = 16.71, p = 0.01) at 6 months.

Effects of a social participation-focused virtual reality intervention for community-dwelling stroke survivors with physical disabilities: a randomised controlled trial protocol,Good,"Chau, JPC; Lo, SHS; Lau, AYL; Lee, VWY; Choi, KC; Kwok, ECF; Thompson, DR",BMJ OPEN,2022,"Introduction Studies show that stroke survivors encounter physical and psychological limitations that restrict their participation in social and community activities. Systematic reviews have yielded inconclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of different interventions intended to support stroke survivors' social participation. Recent advances in virtual reality technology may offer promising solutions, although the optimal approach to enhance social participation among stroke survivors is yet to be determined. This trial aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a social participation-focused virtual reality (SP-VR) intervention on the physical, psychological and social outcomes of community-dwelling stroke survivors with physical disabilities. Methods and analysis A two-arm randomised, controlled, assessor-blind clinical trial will be conducted with 250 stroke survivor-caregiver dyads recruited from three acute and one rehabilitation hospitals, and three stroke nurse-led clinics. Participants will be survivors of a first or recurrent stroke within 6 months of stroke onset and able to remain in a sitting position without support, and their primary caregivers. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive the SP-VR intervention or usual care which includes conventional physical therapy services. The intervention group will receive a newly developed 6-week novel custom-made SP-VR application comprising two sessions weekly. Three SP-VR modules will cover key aspects of survivors' social health needs, namely functional rehabilitation, social participation, and social interaction and recreation. The primary outcome for stroke survivors is social participation, and secondary outcomes include depressive symptoms, participation self-efficacy, physical function, functional mobility and social support. User satisfaction will be evaluated among both survivors and caregivers. Data will be collected in person at baseline, immediately after, and 3 months postintervention.

Effects of audiovisual distraction on children's behaviour during dental treatment: a randomized controlled clinical trial,Not mental health,"Al-Khotani, A; Bello, LA; Christidis, N",ACTA ODONTOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA,2016,"Aim: Dental anxiety leads to undesirable distresses such as avoidance of dental treatment and increase stress among caregivers that consequently affect the treatment quality. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of viewing videotaped cartoons using an eyeglass system (i-theatre) as an audiovisual (AV) distraction technique on behaviour and anxiety in children receiving dental restorative treatment.Methods: Fifty-six consecutive children patients who presented for treatment and met inclusion criteria were included and randomly divided into two groups; a control group without distraction (CTR-group) and a distraction-group (AV-group). Three dental treatment visits were provided for each patient. Anxiety and cooperative behaviour were assessed with the Facial Image Scale (FIS) and the Modified Venham's clinical ratings of anxiety and cooperative behaviour scale (MVARS). The vital signs, blood pressure and pulse were also taken.Results: The AV-group showed significantly lower MVARS scores than the CTR-group (p=0.029), and the scores decreased significantly during treatment in the AV-group (p=0.04). Further, the pulse rate was significantly increased in the CTR-group during injection with local anaesthesia (p=0.02), but not in the AV-group.Conclusion: AV distraction seems to be an effective method in reducing fear and anxiety in children during dental treatment. Further, children who used eyeglass goggle display as a distraction tool during dental treatment reported not only less anxiety than control groups but also showed more positive responses after injection with local anaesthesia.

Effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on quality of life: A systematic review and meta-analysis,Not mental health,"Alimoradi, Z; Jafari, E; Broström, A; Ohayon, MM; Lin, CY; Griffiths, MD; Blom, K; Jernelöv, S; Kaldo, V; Pakpour, AH",SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS,2022,"The effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) have consistently been shown to improve insomnia symptoms and other health-related outcomes, but the effects on QoL have been inconsistent. Many factors including the type CBT-I delivery and type of instrument used to assess QoL make the topic complex. The present systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized the evidence of CBT-I efficacy on QoL outcomes across different populations, delivery modes, and methodological aspects. Following the guidelines on preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a literature search was conducted through PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycINFO using keywords from relevant MeSH terms based on PICOS (Participants, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Study) criteria. Clinical trials investigating the effect of CBT-I as an intervention on QoL with any kind of control group were eligible if they reported mean scores and variation of QoL. Meta-analysis using a random-effect model was conducted to calculate the standardized mean differences (SMDs) in a set including all identified studies, as well as in three sub-sets: face-to-face CBT-I using randomized controlled trials (RCTs), online CBT-I using RCTs, and one-group pre- and post-treatment design. A total of 24 studies comprising 1977 participants (808 in an intervention group) from 12 countries were eligible for meta-analysis. The overall pooled estimate of SMD of QoL when all 24 studies were included was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.22; 0.72; I-2 = 84.5%; tau(2) = 0.31; p < 0.001). The overall pooled estimate of SMD of QoL was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.01-0.90; I-2 = 87.5%; tau(2) = 0.48, p < 0.001) for intervention groups with face-to-face CBT-I compared to controls; 0.47 (95% CI: 0.02-0.92; I-2 = 88.3%; tau(2) = 0.36; p = 0.04) for intervention groups with digital CBT-I compared to controls, and 0.46 (95% CI: 0.12-0.80; I-2 = 52.9%; tau(2) = 0.07; p = 0.08) for one-group pre- and post-comparison using CBT-I intervention compared to baseline. Moreover, effects of CBT-I on QoL were different across populations (pooled SMD = 0.59 for patients with insomnia; 0.29 for patients with insomnia comorbid with another major disorder; and 0.48 for other conditions) and types of QoL instruments (pooled SMD = 0.36 for disease-specific QoL instrument not on insomnia, 0.43 for generic QoL instrument, and 0.67 for a single-QoL-item instrument). The probability of publication bias was ruled out in overall and design specific sub-group analysis based on funnel plot and Egger's test. In conclusion, this meta-analysis confirmed a moderate, overall effect of CBT-I in improving QoL. However, due to small power and heterogeneity, future studies are needed to better explore the impact of moderating factors such as mode of delivery and type of QoL measure for assessment used.

Effects of eHealth Interventions on Quality of Life and Psychological Outcomes in Cardiac Surgery Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,Not mental health,"Ni, RP; Liu, MB; Huang, SM; Yang, J",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Patients undergoing heart surgery may experience a range of physiological changes, and the postoperative recovery time is long. Patients and their families often have concerns about quality of life (QoL) after discharge. eHealth interventions may improve patient participation, ensure positive and effective health management, improve the quality of at-home care and the patient's quality of life, and reduce rates of depression. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of eHealth interventions on the physiology, psychology, and compliance of adult patients after cardiac surgery to provide a theoretical basis for clinical practice. Methods: We conducted systematic searches of the following 4 electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Mean (SD) values were used to calculate the pooled effect sizes for all consecutive data, including QoL, anxiety, and depression. Where the same results were obtained using different instruments, we chose the standardized mean difference with a 95% CI to represent the combined effect size; otherwise, the mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI was used. Odds ratios were used to calculate the combined effect size for all dichotomous data. The Cohen Q test for chi-square distribution and an inconsistency index (I-2) were used to test for heterogeneity among the studies. We chose a fixed-effects model to estimate the effect size if there was no significant heterogeneity in the data (I-2 <= 50%); otherwise, a random-effects model was used. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2). Results: The search identified 3632 papers, of which 19 met the inclusion criteria. In terms of physical outcomes, the score of the control group was lower than that of the intervention group (MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.27, I-2=0%, P=.02). There was no significant difference in the mental outcomes between the intervention and control groups (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.24, I-2=46.4%, P=.14).

Effects of early cognitive rehabilitation training on cognitive function and quality of life in critically ill patients with cognitive impairment: A randomised controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Dong, QL; Yang, YX; Tang, QB; Yang, M; Lan, A; Xiao, HJ; Wei, JX; Cao, XF; Xian, Y; Yang, Q; Chen, DM; Zhao, J; Li, SY",AUSTRALIAN CRITICAL CARE,2023,"Background: Patients often develop cognitive dysfunction during admission to the ICU and after being transferred out of the ICU, which leads to physical disorders, sleep disorders, and psychological stress.Cognitive rehabilitation training can significantly improve patients' planning, decision-making ability, and executive function. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the role of early cognitive rehabilitation training in improving cognitive impairment in critically ill patients. Methods: This study was a prospective, randomised, controlled clinical trial conducted from January 2017 to June 2021. Critically ill patients with cognitive impairment admitted to the Department of Intensive Care Medicine of The Third Hospital of Mianyang were randomly divided into the control (n = 68) and intervention groups (n = 68). Cognitive rehabilitation training (including digital operating system training, music therapy, aerobic training, and mental health intervention) was applied to the patients in the intervention group for 6 months, while the control group did not receive any cognitive intervention. Before 3 and 6 months after enrolment, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the 36Item Short Form Health Survey Scale were used to evaluate cognitive function and quality of life, respectively, in both groups. Results: A total of 136 critical patients were included in the final analysis. There were no significant differences in sex, age, years of education, complications, intensive care unit hospitalisation time, mechanical ventilation time, or the total score of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale when transferred out of the intensive care unit in 24 hours between the two groups. Six months later, the results of the follow-up showed that the cognitive function score in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group (26.69 +/- 2.49 vs. 23.03 +/- 3.79).

Effects of immersive virtual reality intervention on pain and anxiety among pediatric patients undergoing venipuncture: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Wong, CL; Lui, MMW; Choi, KC",TRIALS,2019,"BackgroundVenipuncture is one of the most painful and distressing procedure experienced by pediatric patients. Evidence suggests that distraction combined with age-appropriate procedural information can effectively decrease procedural pain and anxiety in pediatric patients. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) can simultaneously provide complete distraction and procedural information to patients.MethodsGuided by the gate control theory and Lazarus and Folkman's theory, this study aims to examine the effects of IVR intervention on reducing the pain, anxiety and stress, the duration of venipuncture, and the satisfaction of healthcare providers for the procedure. A randomized controlled trial with repeated assessments will be conducted. A total of 200 pediatric patients aged 4-12years will be recruited from a regional public hospital and randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The study will use two age-appropriate IVR modules that consist of procedural information. The intervention group will receive IVR intervention, whereas the control group will receive standard care only. The cost-effectiveness of IVR intervention will be compared with that of standard care. Outcome evaluation will be conducted at four time points: 10min before, during, immediately after, and 30min after the procedure. Intention to treat and generalized estimating equation model will be used to analyze the data.DiscussionThis study is the first of its kind to adopt IVR intervention with age-appropriate procedural information for pediatric patients undergoing venipuncture. Findings of the proposed study may: (1) provide a novel, facile, and cost-effective intervention that can be used virtually at any time and place to manage pain and anxiety; and (2) shed light on the global trends of research and clinical development of IVR as an intervention for other painful and stressful medical procedures.Trial registrationChinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR1800018817.

Various studies evaluated the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on burn wound care. The present study was conducted to determine the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on pain intensity of children with burns. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in various international electronic databases, such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Persian electronic databases such as Iranmedex, and Scientific Information Database using keywords extracted from Medical Subject Headings such as 'Non-pharmacological', 'Virtual reality', 'Pain', 'Burn', 'Wound' and 'Child' from the earliest to December 1, 2022. The risk of bias in the final articles was also assessed with the Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2). Finally, a total of 1005 burn patients were included in 19 studies. The age range of the patients was from 0.5 to 19 years. Of the participants, 50.05% were in the intervention group. All studies had a randomised clinical trial design. The results found that non-pharmacological interventions significantly reduced pain intensity in children (ES: -0.73, 95% CI: -1.08 to -0.38, Z = 4.09, I-2:79.8, P < .001). Virtual reality (VR) (ES: -0.54, 95% CI: -1.19 to -0.18, Z = 2.90, I-2:72.9%, P = .004) and non-VR (ES: -0.86, 95% CI: -1.45 to -0.27, Z = 2.86, I-2:91.4%, P = .04) interventions decreased pain intensity significantly in children based sub-group analysis. Non-pharmacological interventions significantly reduced the pain intensity of dressing removal (ES: -0.77, 95% CI: -1.34 to -0.20, Z = 66.3, I-2:91.8%, P = .008), dressing application (ES: -0.53, 95% CI: -0.97 to -0.09, Z = 2.37, I-2:60.8%, P = .02), and physical therapy (ES: -1.18, 95% CI: -2.10 to -0.26, Z = 2.51, I-2:88.0%, P = .01).

The literature on help-seeking behaviours has frequently highlighted the development of self-stigma because of public stigma and emphasized the need to address public stigmatization faced by them. Given the increasing acceptance of digital services in recent years, this systematic review aimed to examine the effects of online and face-to-face anti-stigma interventions in reducing public stigma towards people experiencing mental health conditions. A search was conducted on the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and ProQuest from inception of the databases to October 2020. Studies were included in this review if they have explored: (i) public stigmatization towards people of all ages with different types of mental health conditions; (ii) online interventions; and (iii) face-to-face interventions. Nine studies were included in this review, of which only five were included in the meta-analysis as the remaining four had incomplete data. The meta-analysis included an aggregate of 1203 participants while the four excluded studies included 713 participants. Results revealed that online interventions performed favourably with small effect sizes in comparison to face-to-face, wait-list control, and no-intervention groups. Results from the studies excluded from the meta-analysis also found a significant reduction of public stigmatization with online interventions. Such findings provide insightful evidence for the effectiveness of online interventions in reducing public stigmatization.

During the hospital admission, these patients suffer from reduced cardiopulmonary performance and decreased psychological health, leading to poor physical function, depression, and morbidity. To prevent post-operative pulmonary complications, a pre and post-operative physical therapy intervention is recommended for patients undergoing heart surgery. Virtual reality (VR) promotes the health status of healthy individuals and those with health conditions. However, few studies have reported the beneficial effects of VR exercise programs on the pulmonary performance and mental health status of patients undergoing OHS.Objectives: To determine whether by using training enhanced by VR, patients who have undergone OHS can more effectively attain cardiopulmonary performance and improve depression than through conventional physical therapy.Method: 60 participants were randomly assigned to a conventional physical therapy and VR exercise program. Each session was conducted once daily until discharge from the hospital. Cardiorespiratory performance and depression were evaluated before surgery and at the time of discharge from the hospital. A two-way mixed ANOVA was performed to compare within (i.e., pre and post-operation) and between (i.e., VR and conventional physical therapy) groups.Results: No significant cardiopulmonary performance gains were detected in patients receiving the VR exercise program when compared with those who participated in conventional physical therapy prior to post-operative OHS (p > 0.05). However, the conventional physical therapy group showed significantly higher depression scores than the VR group ( Delta 4.00 +/- 0.98 vs. Delta 1.68 +/- 0.92).

For patients undergoing replacement therapies like hemodialysis (HD), the pain caused by arteriovenous fistula (AVF) cannulation becomes a significant aspect of their daily lives. This study aimed to examine the impact of virtual reality (VR) distraction techniques on the pain experienced during AVF needle insertion in patients undergoing HD. Materials and methods: This randomized clinical trial (RCT) recruited a total of 60 patients undergoing HD from the 9 Dey Hospital in Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran, between March and August 2022. These patients were then divided into two groups: the intervention group and the control group. The intervention group received distraction techniques using the Shinecon 4th Gen Virtual Reality Headset, while the control group received routine care services. To assess the level of pain experienced during AVF cannulation, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was utilized. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS20. Various statistical tests, including the Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test, Multiple linear regression, and independent-samples t-test, were employed for data analysis. Additionally, Cohen's d was used to determine the effect size of the intervention. Results: The analysis of the data revealed a statistically significant difference in the mean (SD) pain scores between the control group (7.6 +/- 0.8) and the intervention group (5.1 +/- 0.9) (p < 0.002 after Bonferroni correction). Furthermore, it was observed that a majority of patients in the intervention group reported experiencing moderate pain, whereas the control group experienced more severe pain. Conclusions: The study findings demonstrated that the use of virtual reality (VR) was effective in reducing the intensity of pain experienced during AVF needle insertion in patients undergoing HD. Based on these results, it is recommended to incorporate VR as a routine practice in the HD department of the hospital. Trial registration: This study, with the code no.

Yet access to reliable and effective psy-chological treatment is still limited during the pandemic. The widespread adoption of mobile technologies may provide a new way to address this gap. In this research we will develop an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) based intervention delivered by mobile application and will test its usability, efficacy, and mechanism of its effects in relieving PTSD symptoms.Methods: A total of 147 Chinese participants with a diagnosis of PTSD according to the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (app-delivered ACT), an active com-parison group (app-delivered mindfulness), or a waitlist group. Participants in the intervention group or com-parison group will use their respective apps for one month. Online self-report questionnaires will be used to assess the primary outcome of PTSD symptoms and the secondary outcomes symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, and posttraumatic growth. The potential mediating variable to be tested is psychological flexibility and its components. These assessments will be conducted at baseline, at five times during treatment, at the end of treatment, and at 1-and 3-month follow-ups.Discussion: As far as we know, this study is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the usability, ef-ficacy, and mechanism of an app-delivered ACT intervention for PTSD. Furthermore, the research will assess the effect of treatment in reducing dropout rates, explore effective therapeutic components, and investigate mech-anisms of symptom change, which will be valuable in improving the efficacy and usability of PTSD interventions.

Contrary to prediction, the Intervention group did not perform better than the Active Control group; both groups showed significant improvements on anxiety and depressive symptoms from baseline to follow-up. From post-intervention to follow-up, only the Intervention group showed further improvements for anxiety symptoms. Higher engagement with the mHealth app predicted lower anxiety and depressive symptoms at follow-up, and this relationship was fully mediated by psychological mindedness. This study provides evidence that [a] engaging in a CBT mHealth programme can reduce anxiety and worry, and [b] Psychological mindedness is a potential pathway by which engaging with a mHealth app improves anxiety and depressive symptoms. While overall effect sizes were small, at the population level, these can make significant contributions to public mental health",10.1371/journal.pdig.0000095,pubmed,NA,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000095)
"Efficacy of Zemedy, a Mobile Digital Therapeutic for the Self-management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Crossover Randomized Controlled Trial",Not mental health,"Hunt, M; Miguez, S; Dukas, B; Onwude, O; White, S",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2021,"Background: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and defecation-related anxiety, which can result in reduced productivity and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce symptoms of IBS and to improve HRQL, but access to qualified therapists is limited. Smartphone-based digital therapeutic interventions have potential to increase access to guided CBT at scale, but require careful study to assess their benefits and risks. Objective: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a novel app, Zemedy, as a mobile digital therapeutic that delivers a comprehensive CBT program to individuals with IBS. Methods: This was a crossover randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited online and randomly allocated to either immediate treatment (n=62) or waitlist control (n=59) groups. The Zemedy app consists of 8 modules focusing on psychoeducation, relaxation training, exercise, the cognitive model of stress management, applying CBT to IBS symptoms, reducing avoidance through exposure therapy, behavioral experiments, and information about diet. Users interact with a chatbot that presents the information and encourages specific plans, homework, and exercises. The treatment was fully automated, with no therapist involvement or communication. At baseline and after 8 weeks, participants were asked to complete the battery of primary (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life [IBS-QOL], Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale [GSRS]) and secondary (Fear of Food Questionnaire [FFQ], Visceral Sensitivity Index [VSI], Gastrointestinal Cognition Questionnaire [GI-COG], Depression Anxiety Stress Scale [DASS], and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) outcome measures. Waitlist controls were then offered the opportunity to crossover to treatment. All participants were assessed once more at 3 months posttreatment. Results: Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses at posttreatment revealed significant improvement for the immediate treatment group compared to the waitlist control group on both primary and secondary outcome measures. Gains were generally maintained at 3 months posttreatment. Scores on the GSRS, IBS-QoL, GI-COG, VSI, and FFQ all improved significantly more in the treatment group (F-1,F-79=20.49, P<.001, Cohen d=1.01; F-1,F-79=20.12, P<.001, d=1.25; F-1,F-79=34.71, P<.001, d=1.47; F-1,F-79=18.7, P<.001, d=1.07; and F-1,F-79=12.13, P=.001, d=0.62, respectively). Depression improved significantly as measured by the PHQ-9 (F-1,F-79=10.5, P=.002, d=1.07), and the DASS Depression (F-1,F-79=6.03, P=.02, d=.83) and Stress (F-1,F-79=4.47, P=.04, d=0.65) subscales in the completer analysis but not in the intention-to-treat analysis. The impact of treatment on HRQL was mediated by reductions in catastrophizing and visceral sensitivity. Conclusions: Despite its relatively benign physical profile, IBS can be an extraordinarily debilitating condition. Zemedy is an effective modality to deliver CBT for individuals with IBS, and could increase accessibility of this evidence-based treatment.",10.2196/26152,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,digital health; irritable bowel syndrome; cognitive behavioral therapy; CBT; efficacy; mHealth; self-management; IBS; randomized controlled trial; app,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/26152)
Efficacy of a Brief Blended Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program for the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety in University Students: Uncontrolled Intervention Study,Not Multi User,"Atik, E; Stricker, J; Schückes, M; Pittig, A",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2023,"Background: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT)-the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and digital mental health applications-has been increasingly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. As a resource-efficient treatment approach, bCBT appears promising for addressing the growing need for mental health care services, for example, as an early intervention before the chronification of symptoms. However, further research on the efficacy and feasibility of integrated bCBT interventions is needed.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel bCBT program comprising short (25 min), weekly face-to-face therapy sessions combined with a smartphone-based digital health app for treating mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety.Methods: This prospective uncontrolled trial comprised 2 measurement points (before and after treatment) and 2 intervention groups. We recruited university students with mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety. On the basis of the primary symptoms, participants were assigned to either a depression intervention group (n=67 completers) or an anxiety intervention group (n=33 completers). Participants in each group received 6 weekly individual psychotherapy sessions via videoconference and completed modules tailored to their respective symptoms in the smartphone-based digital health app.Results: The depression group displayed medium to large improvements in the symptoms of depression (Cohen d=-0.70 to -0.90; P<.001). The anxiety group experienced significant improvements in the symptoms of generalized anxiety assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale with a large effect size (Cohen d=-0.80; P<.001) but not in symptoms of anxiety assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Cohen d=-0.35; P=.06). In addition, both groups experienced significant improvements in their perceived self-efficacy (Cohen d=0.50; P<.001 in the depression group and Cohen d=0.71; P<.001 in the anxiety group) and quality of life related to psychological health (Cohen d=0.87; P<.001 in the depression group and Cohen d=0.40; P=.03 in the anxiety group).

Advances in web and mobile technologies hold potential in supporting HIV treatment management.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a theory-based mobile health (mHealth) intervention on health behaviors and HIV treatment adherence among patients with HIV/AIDS in Vietnam.Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial on 425 HIV patients in two of the largest HIV clinics in Hanoi, Vietnam. Both the intervention group (238 patients) and the control group (187 patients) received regular consultations with doctors and then participated in 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits. Patients in the intervention group received a theory-driven smartphone app to facilitate medication adherence and self-efficacy in HIV patients. Measurements were developed based on the Health Belief Model, which included the visual analog scale of ART Adherence, HIV Treatment Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale, and HIV Symptom Management Self-Efficacy Scale. We also included the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess patients' mental health throughout treatment.Results: In the intervention group, the adherence score increased significantly (beta=1.07, 95% CI .24-1.90) after 1 month, whereas the HIV adherence self-efficacy was significantly higher after 3 months (beta=2.17, 95% CI 2.07-2.27) compared to the control group. There was a positive but low level of change in risk behaviors such as drinking, smoking, and drug use. Factors related to positive change in adherence were being employed and having stable mental well-being (lower PHQ-9 scores). Factors associated with self-efficacy in treatment adherence and symptom management were gender, occupation, younger age, and having no other underlying conditions. A longer duration of ART increased treatment adherence but decreased self-efficacy in symptom management.Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the mHealth app could improve the overall ART adherence self-efficacy of patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to support our findings.Trial Registration: Thai Clinical Trials Registry TCTR20220928003; https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20220928003",10.2196/43432,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,mobile health; HIV; AIDS; treatment adherence; self-efficacy; behavior; treatment; management; care; feasibility; efficacy; intervention; mHealth; Vietnam; application,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/43432)

Methods: Three-arm randomised controlled trial (Enhanced: physical activity, diet, sleep, Traditional: physical activity, diet, Control) with assessments conducted at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Participants (n= 116) were overweight or obese adults aged 19-65 (M = 44.5 [SD = 10.5]). The 6-month intervention was delivered via a smartphone app providing educational materials, goal-setting, self-monitoring and feedback, and also included one face-to-face dietary consultation, a Fitbit and scales. The trial was prospectively registered and conducted between May 2017 and September 2018. Group differences on primary and secondary outcomes were examined between the Pooled Intervention groups (Pooled Intervention = Enhanced and Traditional) and Control groups, and then between Enhanced and Traditional groups. Results: Nineteen participants (16.4%) formally withdrew from the trial.

Mobile app-based (mobile health [mHealth]) interventions present a novel approach to both reducing stress and improving well-being. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-guided mobile app-based psychological intervention for people providing care to family or friends with a physical or mental disability. Methods: In a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial, 183 caregivers recruited through the web were randomly allocated to either an intervention (n=73) or active control (n=110) condition. The intervention app contained treatment modules combining daily self-monitoring with third-wave (mindfulness-based) cognitive-behavioral therapies, whereas the active control app contained only self-monitoring features. Both programs were completed over a 5-week period. It was hypothesized that intervention app exposure would be associated with decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress, and increases in well-being, self-esteem, optimism, primary and secondary control, and social support. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 3-4 months postintervention. App quality was also assessed. Results: In total, 25% (18/73) of the intervention participants were lost to follow-up at 3 months, and 30.9% (34/110) of the participants from the wait-list control group dropped out before the postintervention survey. The intervention group experienced reductions in stress (b=-2.07; P=.04) and depressive symptoms (b=-1.36; P=.05) from baseline to postintervention. These changes were further enhanced from postintervention to follow-up, with the intervention group continuing to report lower levels of depression (b=-1.82; P=.03) and higher levels of emotional well-being (b=6.13; P<.001), optimism (b=0.78; P=.007), self-esteem (b=-0.84; P=.005), support from family (b=2.15; P=.001), support from significant others (b=2.66; P<.001), and subjective well-being (b=4.82; P<.001).

A wide variety of digital mental health interventions have demonstrated efficacy in improving one's mental health status, and digital interventions that involve some form of human involvement have been shown to demonstrate greater efficacy than self-guided digital interventions. Studies demonstrating the efficacy of digital mental health interventions within the Asian region are scarce.Objective: This study aimed to investigate the potential efficacy of the digital mental health intervention, ThoughtFullChat, which consists of one-on-one, asynchronous, text-based coaching with certified mental health professionals and self-guided tools, in improving self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. The study also aims to examine the potential differences in efficacy among occupational subgroups and between sexes.Methods: A randomized controlled study was conducted among housemen (trainee physicians), students, faculty members, and corporate staff at International Medical University, Malaysia. A total of 392 participants were enrolled and randomized to the intervention (n=197, 50.3%) and control (n=195, 49.7%) groups. Depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 items at baseline and after the 3-month intervention period. The Satisfaction with Life Scale and Brief Resilience Scale were also included, along with a questionnaire about demographics.Results: Significant decrease was observed in depression (P=.02) and anxiety (P=.002) scores in the intervention group. A subgroup (corporate staff) also demonstrated significant decrease in stress (P=.005) alongside depression (P=.006) and anxiety (P=.002). Females showed significant improvements in depression (P=.02) and anxiety (P<.001) when compared with males.Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the ThoughtFullChat app is effective in improving the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in individuals, particularly among corporate staff from the educational field. It also supports the notion that mobile mental health apps that connect users to mental health professionals in a discreet and cost-efficient manner can make important contributions to the improvement of mental health outcomes.

However, the extent to which psychological guidance increases the efficacy of these apps is controversial. Objective: We evaluated the efficacy of a web-based intervention, called Selfapy, for unipolar depression. We also investigated differences between psychotherapist-guided and unguided versions. Methods: Selfapy is a cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention for depressive disorders. Participants with mild-to-severe depressive disorders were assigned randomly to participate in either guided (weekly 25-minute duration telephone calls) intervention, unguided version, or waiting list (control group) for 12 weeks. We assessed depressive symptoms at the start of the study, midway through the intervention (6 weeks), at the end of the intervention (12 weeks), and at follow-up (6 months). The main outcome was difference in the Beck Depression Inventory score between the start of the study and the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes were the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report, the Hamilton Rating Depression Scale, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Results: Of 401 participants, 301 participants (75.1%) completed the intervention. Changes in the Beck Depression Inventory from baseline differed significantly between groups at the postintervention (F-2,F-398=37.20, P<.001).

Efficacy of a children's procedural preparation and distraction device on healing in acute burn wound care procedures: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Brown, NJ; Rodger, S; Ware, RS; Kimble, RM; Cuttle, L",TRIALS,2012,"Background: The intense pain and anxiety triggered by burns and their associated wound care procedures are well established in the literature. Non-pharmacological intervention is a critical component of total pain management protocols and is used as an adjunct to pharmacological analgesia. An example is virtual reality, which has been used effectively to dampen pain intensity and unpleasantness. Possible links or causal relationships between pain/anxiety/stress and burn wound healing have previously not been investigated. The purpose of this study is to investigate these relationships, specifically by determining if a newly developed multi-modal procedural preparation and distraction device (Ditto T) used during acute burn wound care procedures will reduce the pain and anxiety of a child and increase the rate of re-epithelialization. Methods/design: Children (4 to 12 years) with acute burn injuries presenting for their first dressing change will be randomly assigned to either the (1) Control group (standard distraction) or (2) Ditto T intervention group (receiving Ditto T, procedural preparation and Ditto T distraction). It is intended that a minimum of 29 participants will be recruited for each treatment group. Repeated measures of pain intensity, anxiety, stress and healing will be taken at every dressing change until complete wound re-epithelialization. Further data collection will aid in determining patient satisfaction and cost effectiveness of the Ditto T intervention, as well as its effect on speed of wound re-epithelialization. Discussion: Results of this study will provide data on whether the disease process can be altered by reducing stress, pain and anxiety in the context of acute burn wounds.",10.1186/1745-6215-13-238,"pubmed, wos",Research & Experimental Medicine,Burns; Child; Pain; Stress; Anxiety; Salivary cortisol; Salivary alpha-amylase; Virtual reality; Randomized clinical trial,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/1745-6215-13-238)

Efficacy of a hybrid online training for panic symptoms and agoraphobia: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Ebenfeld, L; Stegemann, SK; Lehr, D; Ebert, DD; Jazaieri, H; van Ballegooijen, W; Funk, B; Riper, H; Berking, M",TRIALS,2014,"Background: Recently, internet-based interventions have been proposed as effective treatments for people with panic disorder (PD). However, little is known about the clinical effects of integrating mobile technology into these interventions. Because users carry their smartphones with them throughout the day, we hypothesize that this technology can be used to significantly support individuals with monitoring and overcoming their PD symptoms. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed hybrid intervention that combines internet/PC with smartphone delivery to treat the symptoms of PD. The intervention is based on cognitive behavioral therapy and consists of six modules over a total of six weeks. Methods/Design: A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the effects of a hybrid online training module for PD. Based on a power calculation (d = 0.60; 1-beta of 80%; alpha = 0.05), 90 participants with mild to moderate panic symptoms with or without agoraphobia (as assessed by the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale) will be recruited from the general population and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a six-month waitlist control group. The primary outcome measure will be the severity of panic symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include depression, quality of life, and an observer-based rating of panic severity. Furthermore, data regarding acceptance and the usability of the smartphone app will be assessed. Assessments will take place at baseline as well as eight weeks, three months, and six months after randomization. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from a societal perspective. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. Discussion: To our knowledge, this RCT is one of the first to examine the efficacy of a hybrid online training for adult PD. This study seeks to contribute to the emerging field of hybrid online training. If the intervention is efficacious, then research on this hybrid online training should be extended. The cost-effectiveness analysis will also indicate whether online training is an economical tool for treating PD among adults.",10.1186/1745-6215-15-427,"pubmed, wos",Research & Experimental Medicine,Panic disorder; Agoraphobia; Sub-clinical; Internet; Mobile; Smartphone; Hybrid,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/1745-6215-15-427)

Efficacy of an Internet-based intervention with self-applied exposure therapy in virtual reality for people with panic disorder: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Schultz, J; Baumeister, A; Schmotz, S; Moritz, S; Jelinek, L",TRIALS,2023,"Background Due to several treatment barriers, many individuals with panic disorder do not receive evidence-based treatment. One promising option to narrow this treatment gap is Internet-based psychotherapy, which has been shown particularly effective in guided formats. Still, there remains room for improvement to make these digital therapies more accessible, cost-efficient, and aligned with best practices for in-person interventions (e.g., exposure). The smartphone app Invirto - Treatment for Anxiety offers digitally guided, evidence-based treatment of panic disorders including virtual reality (VR) for exposure therapy. The aim present study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and acceptance of Invirto in comparison to a care-as-usual (CAU) control group.Methods We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial with two conditions (intervention vs. CAU), three assessment times via online surveys (t0: baseline; t1: 3 months after baseline; t2: follow-up assessment 6 months after baseline), and a total of 128 participants with a clinical diagnosis of panic disorder (symptoms must be experienced = 1 year). Recruitment will take place via email, phone, and the study website. The primary outcome will be the change in anxiety symptoms as measured by Beck's Anxiety Inventory from t0 to t1. Secondary outcomes will be the change in anxiety symptoms (measured by the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, PAS; Questionnaire on panic-related Anxieties, Cognitions and Avoidance, ACA), depressive symptoms (measured by the Beck-Depression-Inventory, BDI-II), treatment satisfaction (measured by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, CSQ-8; Treatment Adherence Perception Questionnaire, TAPQ-adapt; Positive and Negative Effects of Psychotherapy Scale, PANEPS-I), psychological flexibility (measured by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II, AAQ-II), and dissociation during VR exposure (measured by an adapted version of the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, PDEQ-adapt). Participants in the intervention group will receive access to the intervention (Invirto) right after t0, while the CAU group will receive access to Invirto after t1. We expect a larger change in both the primary and secondary outcomes from t0 to t1 in the intervention group in comparison to the CAU group.Discussion This study is one of the first to evaluate an Internet-based intervention for people with panic disorder that includes self-application of VR exposure therapy.

Efficacy of an internet and app-based gratitude intervention in reducing repetitive negative thinking and mechanisms of change in the intervention's effect on anxiety and depression: Results from a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Heckendorf, H; Lehr, D; Ebert, DD; Freund, H",BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY,2019,"Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) has been identified as a transdiagnostic process that is involved in various forms of psychopathology, including anxiety and depression. This randomized controlled trial compared a 5 week internet and app-based gratitude intervention (intervention group; IG) with adherence-focused guidance against a wait list control group (WLG) in reducing RNT in a sample with elevated RNT. Method: A total of 260 individuals were randomized to either the IG or the WLG. Data were collected at baseline (T1), within one week post intervention (T2), and at three (3-MFU) and six-months of follow-up (6-MFU; for IG only). The primary outcome was RNT. Secondary outcomes included other mental health outcomes and resilience factors. Results: Participants of the IG reported significantly less RNT at T2 (d = 0.61) and 3-MFU (d = 0.75) as compared to WLG. Improvements were sustained until 6-MFU. Significant, small to moderate effect sizes were identified for most secondary outcomes at T2 and 3-MFU. Furthermore, results of mediation analyses revealed that the gratitude intervention exerts its effect on anxiety and depression by reducing the risk factor of RNT, while the mediating role of resilience was less clear. Conclusions: The gratitude intervention investigated in this study was found to be effective in reducing RNT. Gratitude interventions might affect mental health by two parallel pathways: increasing resources and reducing risk factors.

Efficacy of an internet-based exposure treatment for flying phobia (NO-FEAR Airlines) with and without therapist guidance: a randomized controlled trial,Good,"Campos, D; Bretón-López, J; Botella, C; Mira, A; Castilla, D; Mor, S; Baños, R; Quero, S",BMC PSYCHIATRY,2019,"BackgroundInternet-based treatments appear to be a promising way to enhance the in vivo exposure approach, specifically in terms of acceptability and access to treatment. However, the literature on specific phobias is scarce, and, as far as we know, there are no studies on Flying Phobia (FP). This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an Internet-based exposure treatment for FP (NO-FEAR Airlines) that includes exposure scenarios composed of images and sounds, versus a waiting-list control group. A secondary aim is to explore two ways of delivering NO-FEAR Airlines, with and without therapist guidance.MethodsA randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in which 69 participants were allocated to: 1) NO-FEAR Airlines totally self-applied, 2) NO-FEAR Airlines with therapist guidance, 3) a waiting-list control group. Primary outcome measures were the Fear of Flying Questionnaire-II and the Fear of Flying Scale. Secondary outcomes included the Fear and Avoidance Scales, Clinician Severity Scale, and Patient's Improvement scale. Behavioral outcomes (post-treatment flights and safety behaviors) were also included. Mixed-model analyses with no ad hoc imputations were conducted for primary and secondary outcome measures.ResultsNO-FEAR Airlines (with and without therapist guidance) was significantly effective, compared to the waiting list control group, on all primary and secondary outcomes (all ps<.05), and no significant differences were found between the two ways of delivering the intervention. Significant improvements on diagnostic status and reliable change indexes were also found in both treatment groups at post-treatment. Regarding behavioral outcomes, significant differences in safety behaviors were found at post-treatment, compared to the waiting list. Treatment gains were maintained at 3- and 12-month follow-ups.ConclusionFP can be treated effectively via the Internet. NO-FEAR Airlines helps to enhance the exposure technique and provide access to evidence-based psychological treatment to more people in need. These data are congruent with previous studies highlighting the usefulness of computer-assisted exposure programs for FP, and they contribute to the literature on Internet-based interventions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RCT to investigate the effectiveness of an Internet-based treatment for FP and explore two ways of delivering the intervention (with and without therapist guidance).Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov: NCT02298478(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02298478).

The purpose of the Synergy Study is to test the efficacy of a mobile health combined behavior intervention targeting physical activity and sleep quality. Study design: Randomized, waitlist-controlled trial. Setting/participants: This study had an app-based delivery mode, Australia-wide. The participants were 160 adults who reported insufficient physical activity and poor sleep quality in an eligibility survey. Intervention: The intervention was a mobile app providing educational resources, goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback strategies. It included 12 weeks of personalized support including weekly reports, tool sheets, and prompts. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months (primary), and 6 months (secondary endpoint). Self-reported minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and sleep quality were co-primary outcomes. Resistance training; sitting time; sleep hygiene; sleep timing variability; insomnia severity; daytime sleepiness; quality of life; and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were secondary outcomes. Data were collected between June 2017 and February 2018 and analyzed in August 2018. Results: At 3 months, between-group differences in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity were not statistically significant (p=0.139). Significantly more participants in the intervention group engaged in >= 2 days/week (p=0.004) of resistance training. The intervention group reported better overall sleep quality (p=0.009), subjective sleep quality (p=0.017), sleep onset latency (p=0.013), waketime variability (p=0.018), sleep hygiene (p=0.027), insomnia severity (p=0.002), and lower stress symptoms (p=0.032) relative to waitlist controls. At 6 months, group differences were maintained for sleep hygiene (p=0.048), insomnia severity (p=0.002), and stress symptoms (p=0.006). Differences were observed for bedtime variability (p=0.023), sleepiness (p<0.001), daytime dysfunction (p=0.039), and anxiety symptoms (p=0.003) at 6 months, but not 3 months. Conclusions: This remotely delivered intervention did not produce statistically significant between-group differences in minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. Significant short-term differences in resistance training and short- and medium-term differences in sleep health in favor of the intervention were observed.

Efficacy of digital health interventions in youth with chronic medical conditions: A meta-analysis,Not mental health,"Domhardt, M; Schröder, A; Geirhos, A; Steubl, L; Baumeister, H",INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH,2021,"Background: Digital health interventions might extend service provisions for youth with chronic medical conditions (CC) and comorbid mental health symptoms. We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) for different psychological and disease-related outcomes in children and adolescents with CC. Method: Studies were identified by systematic searches in CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed and PsycINFO, complemented by searches in reference lists of eligible studies and other reviews. We included studies, when they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of an IMI to control conditions in improving psychological and disease-related outcomes in youth (mean age ? 18 years) with CC. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed within a random-effects model, and Hedges? g (with 95% confidence intervals) was calculated as effect size measure. Primary outcomes were comorbid mental health symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress), as well as quality of life and self-efficacy. Results: A total of 19 randomized controlled trials (2410 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. IMIs were associated with improvements in self-efficacy (g = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.61; I2 = 0) and combined diseaserelated outcomes (g = -0.13; 95% CI, -0.25 to -0.01; I2 = 21). Meta-analyses on other outcomes were nonsignificant, and some pre-planned analyses were not feasible because of a shortage of studies. Conclusion: The available evidence on IMIs for improving mental and health-related outcomes in youth with CC is limited. Our findings point to a rather small benefit and limited efficacy.

This study aimed to explore the efficacy of OnPR on mental health outcomes in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19. Patients and methods: We employed a randomized controlled trial following the CONSORT guidelines. The Thai Clinical Trials Registry identification number of this study is TCTR20220729003. We used a block of 4 randomizations generated by a computer program. The intervention group (n = 38) received the OnPR program, and the control group (n = 36) received care as usual. OnPR was an online psychological intervention comprising psychoeducation, sleep hygiene education and relaxation techniques. OnPR was provided by qualified therapists trained with a standard protocol. The primary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and stress, which were determined by the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Outcomes were compared between groups at pre-intervention and postintervention at 1, 4, and 12 weeks using paired t -test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In addition, a linear mixed model was employed to demonstrate the effect changes of OnPR over time. All analyses were two-tailed, with a significance level of 0.05. Results: Of 74 Thai participants, 89.2 % were female, and 11.8 % were male. The average age was 31 years. Participants' baseline characteristics were not statistically significant between the intervention and control groups except for depression and stress scores from DASS-21. OnPR resulted in significantly better improvement in depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality. The mean differences between groups of DASS-21 scores in depression, anxiety and stress at 7-day follow-up were -4.69, -3.29, and -5.50 respectively. The differences continue to be significant at 4-week and 12-week follow-ups. The mean difference between groups of PSQI at 7day follow-up is -0.91.

Efficacy of the Mental Health App Intellect to Improve Body Image and Self-compassion in Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial With a 4-Week Follow-up,Not Multi User,"Ong, WY; Sündermann, O",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2022,"Background: Body image concerns are prevalent among young adults, who may be vulnerable to developing body image concerns because of particular risk factors associated with this life period. With technological advancements, digital mobile health (mHealth) apps are cost-effective and scalable interventions. Thus, mHealth apps can be explored as a form of prevention effort to alleviate body image concerns in young adults.Objective: In this randomized controlled trial, we examined the effectiveness of a self-guided mHealth app in improving body image and self-compassion in a sample of university students.Methods: Participants (N=310) were randomized to a 9-day self-guided body image and self-compassion mHealth app (n=149) and to an active waitlist control group (n=161), where they completed a similarly structured 9-day program on cooperation. Both programs consisted of content learning and activities such as quizzes, with the number and length of activities matched for both programs. Measures were obtained at baseline, upon completion of the programs (after the intervention), and at 4-week follow-up.Results: The intervention group for female participants reported significant reduction in body dissatisfaction (P<.001) and improvements in body appreciation (P<.001) and self-compassion (P=.001) compared with the active waitlist control group after the intervention. Similarly, for male participants after the intervention, a significant reduction was found in the intervention group in body dissatisfaction (P<.001) after the intervention as well as improvements in body appreciation (P=.02) and self-compassion (P=.047). The effects were maintained at 4-week follow-up for female participants on body dissatisfaction (P<.001), body appreciation (P<.001), and self-compassion (P=.02) but not for male participants. On body image risk factors, significant reductions were found for female participants after the intervention for thin-ideal internalization (P<.001), peer pressure (P=.002), and media pressure (P<.001) after the intervention, while the effects were only maintained for thin-ideal internalization (P=.008) and media pressure (P=.01) at 4-week follow-up, compared with the active waitlist control group. As for male participants, no intervention effects were found both after the intervention and at follow-up for all body image risk factors of muscularity internalization, peer pressure, and media pressure. Both apps were acceptable and participants engaged equally across the intervention and active waitlist control groups, as indicated on a measure of app engagement (P=.76).Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for a self-guided mHealth app in improving body image concerns and self-compassion in young adult university students.

Efficacy of the Mental Health App Intellect to Reduce Stress: Randomized Controlled Trial With a 1-Month Follow-up,Not Multi User,"Toh, SHY; Tan, JHY; Kosasih, FR; Sündermann, O",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Excessive stress is a major global health concern, particularly in young adults. Short skills-focused self-guided interventions (SGIs) on smartphones are a scalable way to improve stress-coping skills at the population level. Objective: In this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to examine the possible efficacy of a recently developed stress-coping SGI (Intellect) in improving psychological distress, relative to an active control group and 2 potential moderators of this predicted relationship (ie, psychological mindedness [PM] and coping self-efficacy [CSE]). Methods: University students (N=321) were randomly assigned to either an 8-day SGI on stress-coping or an active control group. Self-reported measures were obtained at baseline, after the intervention, and at the 1-month follow-up. The primary outcome was psychological stress (Psychological Stress Measure-9). Secondary outcomes were anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). PM and CSE were assessed as potential moderators at baseline. Results: The final sample (n=264) included 188 (71.2%) female, 66 (25%) male, 7 (2.7%) nonbinary, and 3 (1.1%) others participants with a mean age of 22.5 (SD 5.41) years. The intervention group reported significantly lower perceived stress (partial eta-squared [eta p(2)]=0.018; P=.03) and anxiety (eta p(2)=0.019; P=.03) levels after intervention relative to the active control group. The effects on perceived stress levels remained statistically significant at the 1-month follow-up (eta p(2)=0.015; P=.05). Students with the lowest CSE and highest PM experienced the fastest decline in perceived stress levels (beta=6.37, 95% Cl 2.98-9.75). Improvements in anxiety levels were not observed at 1-month follow-up. Similarly, no intervention effects were found for depression levels at postintervention and follow-up periods. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the Intellect stress-coping SGI is effective in reducing perceived stress and anxiety levels among university students.

Efficacy of the Mindfulness Meditation Mobile App Calm to Reduce Stress Among College Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Huberty, J; Green, J; Glissmann, C; Larkey, L; Puzia, M; Lee, C",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2019,"Background: College students experience high levels of stress. Mindfulness meditation delivered via a mobile app may be an appealing, efficacious way to reduce stress in college students. Objective: We aimed to test the initial efficacy and sustained effects of an 8-week mindfulness meditation mobile app-Calm-compared to a wait-list control on stress, mindfulness, and self-compassion in college students with elevated stress. We also explored the intervention's effect on health behaviors (ie, sleep disturbance, alcohol consumption [binge drinking], physical activity, and healthy eating [fruit and vegetable consumption]) and the feasibility and acceptability of the app. Methods: This study was a randomized, wait-list, control trial with assessments at baseline, postintervention (8 weeks), and at follow-up (12 weeks). Participants were eligible if they were current full-time undergraduate students and (1) at least 18 years of age, (2) scored >= 14 points on the Perceived Stress Scale, (3) owned a smartphone, (4) were willing to download the Calm app, (5) were willing to be randomized, and (7) were able to read and understand English. Participants were asked to meditate using Calm at least 10 minutes per day. A P value <= .05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 88 participants were included in the analysis. The mean age (SD) was 20.41 (2.31) years for the intervention group and 21.85 (6.3) years for the control group. There were significant differences in all outcomes (stress, mindfulness, and self-compassion) between the intervention and control groups after adjustment for covariates postintervention (all P < .04). These effects persisted at follow-up (all P < .03), except for the nonreacting subscale of mindfulness (P = .08). There was a significant interaction between group and time factors in perceived stress (P = .002), mindfulness (P < .001), and self-compassion (P < .001). Bonferroni posthoc tests showed significant within-group mean differences for perceived stress in the intervention group (P < .001), while there were no significant within-group mean differences in the control group (all P >. 19). Similar results were found for mindfulness and self-compassion. Effect sizes ranged from moderate (0.59) to large (1.24) across all outcomes. A significant groupxtime interaction in models of sleep disturbance was found, but no significant effects were found for other health behaviors. The majority of students in the intervention group reported that Calm was helpful to reduce stress and stated they would use Calm in the future. The majority were satisfied using Calm and likely to recommend it to other college students. The intervention group participated in meditation for an average of 38 minutes/week during the intervention and 20 minutes/week during follow-up. Conclusions: Calm is an effective modality to deliver mindfulness meditation in order to reduce stress and improve mindfulness and self-compassion in stressed college students.

"Efficacy, Benefits, and Harms of a Self-management App in a Swedish Trauma-Exposed Community Sample (PTSD Coach): Randomized Controlled Trial",Good,"Hensler, I; Sveen, J; Cernvall, M; Arnberg, FK",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Self-guided interventions may complement and overcome obstacles to in-person treatment options. The efficacy of app interventions targeting posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is unclear, and results from previous studies on PTSD Coach-an app for managing trauma-related distress-are inconsistent. Objective: This study investigates whether access to the Swedish version of the PTSD Coach affects posttraumatic stress, depressive, and somatic symptoms. In addition, we aim to assess the perceived helpfulness, satisfaction, negative effects, response, and remission related to PTSD Coach. Methods: Adults who had experienced potentially traumatic events in the past 2 years were randomized (1:1) to have access to PTSD Coach (n=89) or be on the waitlist (n=90). We assessed clinical characteristics at baseline (semistructured interviews and self-rating scales) and after 3 months (self-rating scales). We analyzed the data in R software using linear mixed effects models, chi-square tests, and Fisher exact test. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that access to PTSD Coach decreased posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms but not somatic symptoms. More participants who had access to PTSD Coach responded with clinically significant improvement and fewer instances of probable PTSD after 3 months compared with waitlist controls. Overall, participants found that PTSD Coach was slightly to moderately helpful and moderately satisfactory. Half of the intervention group (36/71, 51%) reported at least one negative reaction related to using PTSD Coach (eg, disappointment with the app or its results, arousal of stress, or distressing memories). Conclusions: Using PTSD Coach may trigger symptoms among a few users; however, most of them perceived PTSD Coach as helpful and satisfactory. This study showed that having access to PTSD Coach helped improve psychological trauma-related symptoms.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the addition of facilitation to web-based training on dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills to promote adoption of this intervention among diverse mental health providers at US Veterans Health Administration facilities. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 41 participants completed six web-based modules and met in two groups monthly over nine months by telephone with a facilitator who was also an experienced DBT skills group therapist. All participants agreed to conduct a DBT skills group as part of training. The facilitators employed a variety of engagement strategies to meet the evolving needs of participants during the training period. Participants completed an online evaluation of the modules and their facilitation experience at six weeks post-training and responded to an e-mail query at five months post-training about conducting a DBT group. Findings - Overall, participants found the training and monthly interprofessional calls with the facilitator useful. Five months post-training, 33 of 41 participants reported conducting a DBT skills group, thus improving access to this intervention. Participants said the biggest barrier to training was finding time during clinic hours to complete the modules, despite assurances of support from local leaders.

Empathic conversational agents for real-time monitoring and co-facilitation of patient-centered healthcare,Other,"Adikari, A; de Silva, D; Moraliyage, H; Alahakoon, D; Wong, JH; Gancarz, M; Chackochan, S; Park, B; Heo, R; Leung, Y",FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE,2022,"Healthcare systems across the world are transitioning into patient-centered healthcare models to ensure improved health outcomes, increased operational efficiencies and respectful patient engagement. Digital health technologies are at the forefront of this transition in facilitating a role for the patient in the clinical dimensions of the healthcare trajectory, from diagnosis and interventions to treatment and recovery. Despite this prevalence in the clinical space, the non-clinical needs of patient mental health and wellbeing are frequently overlooked by contemporary patient-centered healthcare models. Conversational agents (or chatbots) are digital dialogue systems that are widespread and widely used in sequential information provision and information acquisition tasks. Given the intimate nature of this human-machine interaction, conversational agents can be effectively utilized to support and sustain patient mental health and wellbeing. In this paper, we propose an empathic conversational agent framework based on an ensemble of natural language processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms for real-time monitoring and co-facilitation of patient-centered healthcare for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes. The technical contributions of this framework are; detection of patient emotions, prediction of patient emotion transitions, detection of group emotions, formulation of patient behavioral metrics, and resource recommendations based on patient concerns. The architectural contributions of the framework are intelligent communication channels that stream empathic conversational elements and resource recommendations for the multi-user conversations and co-facilitation updates for the human healthcare provider interface. The framework was empirically evaluated on a benchmark dataset and further validated based on a clinical protocol designed for its application in an online support group setting for cancer patients and caregivers in Canada. The results of these experiments confirm the effectiveness of this framework, its contributory role and practical value in realizing a patient-centered healthcare model for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes.

Employing the Gini coefficient to measure participation inequality in treatment-focused Digital Health Social Networks,Not mental health,"van Mierlo, T; Hyatt, D; Ching, AT",NETWORK MODELING AND ANALYSIS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS AND BIOINFORMATICS,2016,"Digital Health Social Networks (DHSNs) are common; however, there are few metrics that can be used to identify participation inequality. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the Gini coefficient, an economic measure of statistical dispersion traditionally used to measure income inequality, could be employed to measure DHSN inequality. Quarterly Gini coefficients were derived from four long-standing DHSNs. The combined data set included 625,736 posts that were generated from 15,181 actors over 18,671 days. The range of actors (8-2323), posts (29-28,684), and Gini coefficients (0.15-0.37) varied. Pearson correlations indicated statistically significant associations between number of actors and number of posts (0.527-0.835, p < .001), and Gini coefficients and number of posts (0.342-0.725, p < .001). However, the association between Gini coefficient and number of actors was only statistically significant for the addiction networks (0.619 and 0.276, p < .036). Linear regression models had positive but mixed R-2 results (0.333-0.527). In all four regression models, the association between Gini coefficient and posts was statistically significant (t = 3.346-7.381, p < .002). However, unlike the Pearson correlations, the association between Gini coefficient and number of actors was only statistically significant in the two mental health networks (t = -4.305 and -5.934, p < .000).

Effectiveness data are needed in diverse patients. Introduction:We previously conducted a 3-arm randomized trial (263 adults with chronic low back pain) which compared group-based (1) single-session pain relief skills intervention (Empowered Relief; ER); (2) 8-session cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for chronic back pain; and (3) single-session health and back pain education class (HE). Results suggested non-inferiority of ER vs. CBT at 3 months post-treatment on an array of outcomes.Here, we tested the durability of treatment effects at 6 months post-treatment. We examined group differences in primary and secondary outcomes at 6 months and the degree to which outcomes eroded or improved from 3-month to 6-month within each treatment group.Empowered Relief remained non-inferior to CBT on most outcomes, whereas both ER and CBT remained superior to HE on most outcomes. Outcome improvements within ER did not decrease significantly from 3-month to 6-month, and indeed ER showed additional 3- to 6-month improvements on pain catastrophizing, pain bothersomeness, and anxiety. Effects of ER at 6 months post-treatment (moderate term outcomes) kept pace with effects reported by participants who underwent 8-session CBT.The maintenance of these absolute levels implies strong stability of ER effects. Results extend to 6 months post-treatment previous findings documenting that ER and CBT exhibit similarly potent effects on outcomes.Chronic low back pain is the most prevalent chronic pain condition among adults worldwide.18 Patient education on pain self-management and multisession cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are recommended as first-line treatments for back pain,17 and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend CBT integration into comprehensive care plans.27 Often, group-based CBT for chronic pain is delivered over eight 2-hour sessions (16 hours total treatment time). Content includes pain education, self-regulatory skills training, problem-solving and action planning, and home practice between sessions. Rigorous back pain studies8,38 and chronic pain meta-analyses41 suggest CBT has small-to-moderate effects for multidimensional symptom reduction in chronic pain. However, multiple barriers prevent broad access to CBT, such as physician referral, lack of insurance in the U.S., lack of trained professionals, extensive wait times, and burdens associated with multisession treatment.11,25 Effective briefer options could ease care barriers, facilitate the implementation of recommended guidelines, and scale best practices to treat chronic low back pain.Empowered Relief (ER) is a 2-hour single-session pain relief skills intervention that includes cognitive behavioral skills acquisition, mindfulness principles, and pain neuroscience education.10,12,13 Previously, we conducted a three-arm randomized controlled trial in 263 community adults with chronic low back pain in which we compared 2-hour ER, a 2-hour back health education (HE) class, and an 8-session back pain CBT protocol (16 hours of total treatment time).7,8 In this trial, pain catastrophizing, a cognitive and emotional pain response pattern that includes increased attention, and feelings of pain helplessness, was selected as the primary outcome because of its impacts on the intensity and trajectory of chronic pain6,39 and responsiveness to CBT.38,40,41 Results revealed noninferiority in outcome potency of a 2-hour pain relief skills intervention compared with a standard course of an 8-session CBT at 3 months posttreatment. Specifically, ER was noninferior to an 8-session CBT for reducing pain catastrophizing, pain intensity, pain interference, pain bothersomeness, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression; across variables, ER and CBT had moderate-to-large treatment effects that were superior to HE at 3 months.13 Such findings suggest that for some patients, brief psychosocial pain interventions may represent satisfactory alternatives to more lengthy and resource-intensive treatment, at least in the short-term. Evidence of extended efficacy of 1-session ER could inform broad treatment adoption in clinical practice, resource allocation, and third-party payer reimbursement in the U.S.Accordingly, the current report describes 6-month outcome data for our three-arm randomized comparative efficacy trial. First, we examined whether ER retained noninferiority to CBT and superiority to HE on baseline to 6-month posttreatment changes for primary and secondary outcomes. Results of these analyses also would indicate the relative position of an 8-session CBT and brief ER with respect to maintenance of longer-term effects. We hypothesized that at 6 months posttreatment, ER and CBT would be superior to HE and that ER would maintain noninferiority with CBT. Second, we examined the degree to which ER showed increments or decrements in outcome values from 3 months to 6 months posttreatment.

Outcome improvements within ER did not decrease significantly from 3-month to 6-month, and indeed ER showed additional 3- to 6-month improvements on pain catastrophizing, pain bothersomeness, and anxiety. Effects of ER at 6 months post-treatment (moderate term outcomes) kept pace with effects reported by participants who underwent 8-session CBT.The maintenance of these absolute levels implies strong stability of ER effects.

Engagement With a Mobile Phone-Based Life Skills Intervention for Adolescents and Its Association With Participant Characteristics and Outcomes: Tree-Based Analysis,Not Multi User,"Castro, RP; Haug, S; Debelak, R; Jakob, R; Kowatsch, T; Schaub, MP",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Mobile phone-delivered life skills programs are an emerging and promising way to promote mental health and prevent substance use among adolescents, but little is known about how adolescents actually use them. Objective: The aim of this study is to determine engagement with a mobile phone-based life skills program and its different components, as well as the associations of engagement with adolescent characteristics and intended substance use and mental health outcomes. Methods: We performed secondary data analysis on data from the intervention group (n=750) from a study that compared a mobile phone-based life skills intervention for adolescents recruited in secondary and upper secondary school classes with an assessment-only control group. Throughout the 6-month intervention, participants received 1 SMS text message prompt per week that introduced a life skills topic or encouraged participation in a quiz or individual life skills training or stimulated sharing messages with other program participants through a friendly contest. Decision trees were used to identify predictors of engagement (use and subjective experience). The stability of these decision trees was assessed using a resampling method and by graphical representation. Finally, associations between engagement and intended substance use and mental health outcomes were examined using logistic and linear regression analyses. Results: The adolescents took part in half of the 50 interactions (mean 23.6, SD 15.9) prompted by the program, with SMS text messages being the most used and contests being the least used components. Adolescents who did not drink in a problematic manner and attended an upper secondary school were the ones to use the program the most. Regarding associations between engagement and intended outcomes, adolescents who used the contests more frequently were more likely to be nonsmokers at follow-up than those who did not (odds ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.98; P=.02). In addition, adolescents who read the SMS text messages more attentively were less likely to drink in a problematic manner at follow-up (odds ratio 0.43, 95% CI 1.29-3.41; P=.003). Finally, participants who used the program the most and least were more likely to increase their well-being from baseline to 6-month follow-up compared with those with average engagement (beta(s)=.39; t(586)=2.66; P=.008; R-2=0.24). Conclusions: Most of the adolescents participating in a digital life skills program that aimed to prevent substance use and promote mental health engaged with the intervention. However, measures to increase engagement in problem drinkers should be considered. Furthermore, efforts must be made to ensure that interventions are engaging and powerful across different educational levels. First results indicate that higher engagement with digital life skills programs could be associated with intended outcomes. Future studies should apply further measures to improve the reach of lower-engaged participants at follow-up to establish such associations with certainty.",10.2196/28638,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,engagement; life skills; adolescents; mobile phone; machine learning; decision tree; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/28638)
Engagement With a Remote Symptom-Tracking Platform Among Participants With Major Depressive Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial,Other,"White, KM; Carr, E; Leightley, D; Matcham, F; Conde, P; Ranjan, Y; Simblett, S; Dawe-Lane, E; Williams, L; Henderson, C; Hotopf, M",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2024,"Background: Multiparametric remote measurement technologies (RMTs), which comprise smartphones and wearable devices, have the potential to revolutionize understanding of the etiology and trajectory of major depressive disorder (MDD). Engagement with RMTs in MDD research is of the utmost importance for the validity of predictive analytical methods and long-term use and can be conceptualized as both objective engagement (data availability) and subjective engagement (system usability and experiential factors). Positioning the design of user interfaces within the theoretical framework of the Behavior Change Wheel can help maximize effectiveness. In-app components containing information from credible sources, visual feedback, and access to support provide an opportunity to promote engagement with RMTs while minimizing team resources. Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard in quantifying the effects of in-app components on engagement with RMTs in patients with MDD. Objective: This study aims to evaluate whether a multiparametric RMT system with theoretically informed notifications, visual progress tracking, and access to research team contact details could promote engagement with remote symptom tracking over and above the system as usual. We hypothesized that participants using the adapted app (intervention group) would have higher engagement in symptom monitoring, as measured by objective and subjective engagement. Methods: A 2-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (participant-blinded) with 1:1 randomization was conducted with 100 participants with MDD over 12 weeks. Participants in both arms used the RADAR-base system, comprising a smartphone app for weekly symptom assessments and a wearable Fitbit device for continuous passive tracking. Participants in the intervention arm (n=50, 50%) also had access to additional in-app components. The primary outcome was objective engagement, measured as the percentage of weekly questionnaires completed during follow-up. The secondary outcomes measured subjective engagement (system engagement, system usability, and emotional self-awareness). Results: The levels of completion of the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) were similar between the control (67/97, 69%) and intervention (66/97, 68%) arms (P value for the difference between the arms=.83, 95% CI -9.32 to 11.65). The intervention group participants reported slightly higher user engagement (1.93, 95% CI -1.91 to 5.78), emotional self-awareness (1.13, 95% CI -2.93 to 5.19), and system usability (2.29, 95% CI -5.93 to 10.52) scores than the control group participants at follow-up; however, all CIs were wide and included 0. Process evaluation suggested that participants saw the in-app components as helpful in increasing task completion. Conclusions: The adapted system did not increase objective or subjective engagement in remote symptom tracking in our research cohort.

Engagement in an Interactive App for Symptom Self-Management during Treatment in Patients With Breast or Prostate Cancer: Mixed Methods Study,Other,"Crafoord, MT; Fjell, M; Sundberg, K; Nilsson, M; Langius-Eklöf, A",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2020,"Background: Using mobile technology for symptom management and self-care can improve patient-clinician communication and clinical outcomes in patients with cancer. The interactive app Interaktor has been shown to reduce symptom burden during cancer treatment. It includes symptom assessment, an alert system for contact with health care professionals, access to self-care advice, and visualization of symptom history. It is essential to understand how digital interventions operate; one approach is to examine engagement by assessing usage and exploring user experiences. Actual usage in relation to the intended use-adherence-is an essential factor of engagement. Objective: This study aimed to describe engagement with the Interaktor app among patients with breast or prostate cancer during treatment. Methods: Patients from the intervention groups of two separate randomized controlled trials were included: patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=74) and patients with locally advanced prostate cancer receiving treatment with radiotherapy (n=75). The patients reported their symptoms daily. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained from baseline questionnaires and medical records. Logged data usage was retrieved from the server and analyzed descriptively and with multiple regression analysis. Telephone interviews were conducted with patients about their perceptions of using the app and analyzed using content analysis. Results: The median adherence percentage to daily symptom reporting was 83%. Most patients used the self-care advice and free text message component. Among the patients treated for breast cancer, higher age predicted a higher total number of free text messages sent (P=.04). Among the patients treated for prostate cancer, higher age (P=.01) and higher education level (P=.04), predicted an increase in total views on self-care advice, while higher comorbidity (P=.004) predicted a decrease in total views on self-care advice. Being married or living with a partner predicted a higher adherence to daily symptom reporting (P=.02). Daily symptom reporting created feelings of having continuous contact with health care professionals, being acknowledged, and safe. Being contacted by a nurse after a symptom alert was considered convenient and highly valued. Treatment and time-related aspects influenced engagement. Daily symptom reporting was perceived as particularly meaningful at the beginning of treatment. Requests were made for advice on diet and psychological symptoms, as well as for more comprehensive and detailed information as the patient progressed through treatment. Conclusions: Patient engagement in the interactive app Interaktor was high. The app promoted patient participation in their care through continuous and convenient contact with health care professionals. The predictive ability of demographic variables differed between patient groups, but higher age and a higher educational level predicted higher usage of specific app functions for both patient groups. Patients' experience of relevance and interactivity influenced their engagement positively.",10.2196/17058,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,engagement; adherence; mHealth; mobile app; cancer supportive care; symptom management; usage metrics; breast cancer; prostate cancer,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/17058)
Engagement over telehealth: comparing attendance between dialectical behaviour therapy delivered face-to-face and via telehealth for programs in Australia and New Zealand during the Covid-19 pandemic,Not Multi User,"Walton, CJ; Gonzalez, S; Cooney, EB; Leigh, L; Szwec, S",BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER AND EMOTION DYSREGULATION,2023,"Background While the COVID-19 crisis has had numerous global negative impacts, it has also presented an imperative for mental health care systems to make digital mental health interventions a part of routine care. Accordingly, through necessity, many Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) programs transitioned to telehealth, despite little information on clinical outcomes compared with face-to-face treatment delivery. This study examined differences in client engagement (i.e. attendance) of DBT: delivered face-to-face prior to the first COVID-19 lockdown in Australia and New Zealand; delivered via telehealth during the lockdown; and delivered post-lockdown. Our primary outcomes were to compare: [1] client attendance rates of DBT individual therapy delivered face-to-face with delivery via telehealth, and [2] client attendance rates of DBT skills training delivered face-to-face compared with delivery via telehealth.Methods DBT programs across Australia and New Zealand provided de-identified data for a total of 143 individuals who received DBT treatment provided via telehealth or face-to-face over a six-month period in 2020. Data included attendance rates of DBT individual therapy sessions; attendance rates of DBT skills training sessions as well as drop-out rates and First Nations status of clients.Results A mixed effects logistic regression model revealed no significant differences between attendance rates for clients attending face-to-face sessions or telehealth sessions for either group therapy or individual therapy. This result was found for clients who identified as First Nations persons and those who didn't identify as First Nations persons.Conclusions Clients were as likely to attend their DBT sessions over telehealth as they were face-to-face during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. These findings provide preliminary evidence that providing DBT over telehealth may be a viable option to increase access for clients, particularly in areas where face-to-face treatment is not available. Further, based on the data collected in this study, we can be less concerned that offering telehealth treatment will compromise attendance rates compared to face-to-face treatment. Further research is needed comparing clinical outcomes between treatments delivered face-to-face compared delivery via telehealth.",10.1186/s40479-023-00221-4,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,Dialectical Behaviour Therapy; Telehealth; Telemedicine; Face-to-face; Covid-19; Attendance; Drop-out; Engagement,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40479-023-00221-4)
Engaging Refugees With a Culturally Adapted Digital Intervention to Improve Sleep: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial,Not Multi User,"Spanhel, K; Hovestadt, E; Lehr, D; Spiegelhalder, K; Baumeister, H; Bengel, J; Sander, LB",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2022,"Refugees are exposed to multiple stressors affecting their mental health. Given various barriers to mental healthcare in the arrival countries, innovative healthcare solutions are needed. One such solution could be to offer low-threshold treatments, for example by culturally adapting treatments, providing them in a scalable format, and addressing transdiagnostic symptoms. This pilot trial examined the feasibility, acceptance, and preliminary effectiveness of a culturally adapted digital sleep intervention for refugees. Sixty-six refugees participated, with 68.2% of them seeking psychological help for the first time. Only three participants did not show clinically significant insomnia severity, 93.9% reported past traumatic experiences. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) or the waitlist control group (CG). Insomnia severity, measured by the Insomnia Severity Index, and secondary outcomes (sleep quality, fear of sleep, fatigue, depression, wellbeing, mental health literacy) were assessed at baseline, 1 and 3 months after randomization. The self-help intervention included four modules on sleep hygiene, rumination, and information on mental health conditions associated with sleep disturbances. 66.7% of the IG completed all modules. Satisfaction with the intervention and its perceived cultural appropriateness were high. Linear multilevel analyses revealed a small, non-significant intervention effect on insomnia severity of Hedge's g = 0.28 at 3-months follow-up, comparing the IG to the CG [F-2,F- 60 = 0.88, p = 0.421]. This non-confirmatory pilot trial suggests that low-threshold, viable access to mental healthcare can be offered to multiple burdened refugees by culturally adapting an intervention, providing it in a scalable format, and addressing a transdiagnostic symptom.",10.3389/fpsyt.2022.832196,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,culturally sensitive treatment; refugees; healthcare barriers; sleep disturbances; transdiagnostic symptoms; internet-based interventions; low-threshold treatment,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.832196)
Enhanced neurorehabilitation techniques in the DVBIC Assisted Living Pilot Project,Other,"Hoffman, SW; Shesko, K; Harrison, CR",NEUROREHABILITATION,2010,"Traumatic Brain Injury has been labeled the silent epidemic in our current wars. Both CBO and the RAND reports predict that the costs of these injuries will be both extensive and enduring. The projected costs are based not only upon the loss contribution of these warriors to our economy, but also the long-term medical and assistive care that will be needed to support these veterans for decades to come. Thus, the primary goal of the Assisted Living Pilot Project (ALPP) at the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center-Johnstown (DVBIC-J) is to promote the ability of the injured warrior to move from assisted living to living independently and to be self-supporting by providing a continuum of care. To accomplish this goal the DVBIC-J ALPP is providing full set of traditional services (physical, occupational, speech, psychological/cognitive, social/familial, vocational, and spiritual), along with cutting-edge rehabilitative treatment technologies. These cutting-edge therapies include transdisciplinary clinical consultations, interactive patient and family counseling, and telemedicine-teleconferencing for clinical evaluations and family/significant other care participation. These services will be available to those who require assisted living through their progression to community re-entry. The ALPP also serves as a vehicle for clinical trials to investigate the effects of an enriched environment (e. g., recreational therapies, massage, multisensory stimulation, etc.) on neurorehabilitation therapy, rural telemedicine for servicemembers with traumatic brain injury, and long-term outcome measures of those who have received neurorehabilitation services at the DVBIC-J site. DVBIC-J is also developing collaborative projects with universities and private industry to create an incubator for new rehabilitation technologies.

We report findings from a trial of an online mental health role-play simulation for elementary school teachers on changes in attitudes and self-reported helping behaviors for students experiencing psychological distress. METHODSWe randomly assigned 18,896 elementary school teachers to wait-list control or intervention conditions in which they received the 45- to 90-minute online role-play simulation. We administered a version of the validated Gatekeeper Behavior Scale at baseline and postintervention, which measures attitudinal dimensions shown to predict teacher helping behavior change. Self-reported helping behaviors were collected at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Outcomes were compared between the intervention follow-up and control group baseline measures. RESULTSThe intervention group posttraining scores were significantly higher (p < .001) than the control group for all the preparedness, likelihood, and self-efficacy Gatekeeper Behavior subscales. All 5 helping behaviors were significantly higher among the intervention group at follow-up compared to the control group at baseline.

Enhancing cognitive flexibility and working memory in individuals with mild cognitive impairment: Exploring the impact of virtual reality on daily life activities,Not Multi User,"Sasaninezhad, M; Moradi, A; Farahimanesh, S; Choobin, MH; Almasi-Dooghaee, M",GERIATRIC NURSING,2024,"Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serving as a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. This study aimed to explore the impact of virtual reality (VR) on enhancing cognitive flexibility, working memory, and daily life activities. Forty participants diagnosed with MCI were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (N = 20) or a control group (N = 20). Evaluations were at baseline, post-training, and three months post-training using various cognitive assessment tools. Results showed that the VR-based cognitive rehabilitation significantly improved instrumental activities of daily living performance, visual and verbal working memory, and reduced anxiety and depression symptoms. While cognitive flexibility did not exhibit significant improvement, these findings highlight VR interventions as a potential avenue for improving cognitive and functional aspects, and alleviating psychological symptoms in individuals with MCI. Further research with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up periods is recommended to establish the long-term effectiveness of such interventions. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Enhancing exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): a randomized clinical trial of virtual reality and imaginal exposure with a cognitive enhancer,Good,"Difede, J; Rothbaum, BO; Rizzo, AA; Wyka, K; Spielman, L; Reist, C; Roy, MJ; Jovanovic, T; Norrholm, SD; Cukor, J; Olden, M; Glatt, CE; Lee, FS",TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY,2022,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant public health issue. Yet, there are limited treatment options and no data to suggest which treatment will work for whom. We tested the efficacy of virtual reality exposure (VRE) or prolonged imaginal exposure (PE), augmented with D-cycloserine (DCS) for combat-related PTSD. As an exploratory aim, we examined whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) moderated treatment response. Military personnel with PTSD (n = 192) were recruited into a multisite double-blind randomized controlled trial to receive nine weeks of VRE or PE, with DCS or placebo. Primary outcome was the improvement in symptom severity. Randomization was stratified by comorbid depression (MDD) and site. Participants in both VRE and PE showed similar meaningful clinical improvement with no difference between the treatment groups. A significant interaction (p = 0.45) suggested VRE was more effective for depressed participants (CAPS difference M = 3.51 [95% CI 1.17-5.86], p = 0.004, ES = 0.14) while PE was more effective for nondepressed participants (M = -8.87 [95% CI -11.33 to -6.40], p < 0.001, ES = -0.44). The main effect of DCS vs. placebo was not significant. Augmentation by MDD interaction (p = 0.073) suggested that depressed participants improved more on placebo (M = -8.43 [95% CI -10.98 to -5.88], p < 0.001, ES = -0.42); DCS and placebo were equally effective for nondepressed participants. There was an apparent moderating effect of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on DCS augmentation (ES = 0.67). Met66 allele carriers improved more on DCS (ES = -0.25). FAAH 385 A carriers improved more than non-carriers (ES = 0.33), particularly those with MDD (ES = 0.62). This study provides a step toward precision therapeutics for PTSD by demonstrating that comorbid MDD and genetic markers may help guide treatment selection.

Enhancing the scalability of the collaborative care model for depression using mobile technology,Other,"Carleton, KE; Patel, UB; Stein, D; Mou, D; Mallow, A; Blackmore, MA",TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,2020,"The collaborative care model (CoCM) has substantial support for improving behavioral health care in primary care. However, large-scale CoCM adoption relies on addressing operational and financial implementation challenges across health care settings with varying resources. An academic medical center serving socioeconomically and racially diverse patients implemented the CoCM in seven practices. A smartphone application was introduced to facilitate CoCM care management during depression treatment (app-augmented CoCM). App features included secure texting, goal/appointment reminders, symptom monitoring, and health education material. A nonrandomized convenience patient sample (N = 807) was enrolled in app-augmented CoCM and compared with patients in standard CoCM (N = 3,975). Data were collected on clinical contact frequency, engagement, and clinical outcomes. App-augmented CoCM patients received more health care team contacts (7.9 vs. 4.9, p < .001) and shorter time to follow up compared with the standard CoCM sample (mean = 11 vs. 19 days, p < .001). App-augmented CoCM patients had clinical outcomes similar to the standard CoCM group (47% vs. 46% with >= 50% depression improvement or score <10), despite app-augmented patients having more prior depression treatment episodes. Further, the app-augmented group with greater app engagement demonstrated increased behavioral health appointment compliance, including more completed appointments and fewer no shows, and greater depression symptom improvement than those with less app engagement. App-augmented CoCM may improve patient engagement in treatment and provide opportunities to implement key CoCM elements without overburdening practice resources.

Evaluating a Peer-Support Mobile App for Mental Health and Substance Use Among Adolescents Over 12 Months During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Birrell, L; Debenham, J; Furneaux-Bate, A; Prior, K; Spallek, S; Thornton, L; Chapman, C; Newton, N",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Although it is well known that adolescents frequently turn to their friends for support around mental health and substance use problems, there are currently no evidence-based digital programs to support them to do this. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Mind your Mate program, a digital peer-support program, in improving mental health symptoms, reducing the uptake of substance use, and increasing help seeking. The Mind your Mate program consists of a 40-minute web-based classroom lesson and a companion smartphone mobile app. The active control group received school-based health education as usual. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with 12 secondary schools and 166 students (mean age 15.3, SD 0.41 years; 72/166, 43.4% female; and 133/166, 80.1% born in Australia). Participants completed self-reported questionnaires assessing symptoms of mental health (depression, anxiety, and psychological distress), substance use (alcohol and other drug use), and help-seeking measures at baseline and at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Results: Students who received the Mind your Mate program had greater reductions in depressive symptoms over a 12-month period than controls (b=-1.86, 95% CI -3.73 to 0.02; Cohen d=-0.31). Anxiety symptoms decreased among students in the intervention group; however, these reductions did not meet statistical significance thresholds. No differences were observed in relation to psychological distress or help-seeking.

Veterans often struggle to identify problems as mental health difficulties. In addition, they may fail to recognize the need for support before reaching a crisis point and face difficulties navigating care pathways to access support.Objective: A feasibility trial was conducted to assess a novel digital smartphone app (Mental Health Toolkit for Veterans Project [MeT4VeT]) for UK Armed Forces (UKAF) veterans experiencing mental health difficulties. The trial aimed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of trial procedures for a later randomized controlled trial (RCT) and to assess the acceptability of the MeT4VeT app.Methods: Participants were recruited at UK military medical centers, by advertising on social media, and through veteran third-sector organizations between February and November 2021, and assessed for eligibility (male, owned a smartphone, served at least 2 years in the UKAF, left the UKAF within the last 2 years, not undertaking formal mental health treatment). Eligible participants were assigned, on a 1:1 ratio, to either the intervention group (full app) or a control group (noninteractive app with signposting information). Three key objectives were determined a priori to assess the practicality of running an RCT including an assessment of recruitment and retention, evaluation of the technical app delivery and measurement processes, and acceptability and usability of the intervention. Results: In total, 791 individuals completed the participant information sheet, of which 261 (33%) were ineligible, 377 (48%) declined or were unable to be contacted for consent, and 103 (13%) did not download the app or complete the baseline measures. Of this, 50 participants completed baseline measures and were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=24) or the control group (n=26).

Lifestyle-based mental healthcare offers an additional approach to existing services with potential to help alleviate system burden. Despite the latest Royal Australian New Zealand College of Psychiatrists guidelines recommending that lifestyle is a'first-line', 'non-negotiable' treatment for mood disorders, few such programs exist within clinical practice. Additionally, there are limited data to determine whether lifestyle approaches are equivalent to established treatments. Using an individually randomised group treatment design, we aim to address this gap by evaluating an integrated lifestyle program (CALM) compared to an established therapy (psychotherapy), both delivered via telehealth. It is hypothesised that the CALM program will not be inferior to psychotherapy with respect to depressive symptoms at 8 weeks. Methods: The study is being conducted in partnership with Barwon Health's Mental Health, Drugs & Alcohol Service (Geelong, Victoria), from which 184 participants from its service and surrounding regions are being recruited. Eligible participants with elevated psychological distress are being randomised to CALM or psychotherapy. Each takes a trans-diagnostic approach, and comprises four weekly (weeks 1-4) and two fortnightly (weeks 6 and 8) 90-min, group[based sessions delivered via Zoom (digital video conferencing platform). CALM focuses on enhancing knowledge, behavioural skills and support for improving dietary and physical activity behaviours, delivered by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist and Accredited Practising Dietitian. Psychotherapy uses cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) delivered by a Psychologist or Clinical Psychologist, and Provisional Psychologist. Data collection occurs at baseline and 8weeks. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms (assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) at 8 weeks. Societal and healthcare costs will be estimated to determine the cost-effectiveness of the CALM program. A process evaluation will determine its reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance.

Twenty healthy participants were tasked with locating a fire on a virtual International Space Station (VR-ISS). After orientation, the treatment group (n = 10) practiced searching for a fire while exposed to a low-level stressor (light smoke), while the control group (n = 10) practiced without smoke. In the testing session, both groups responded to a fire while the VR-ISS unexpectedly filled with heavy smoke. Heart rate variability and blood pressure were measured continuously. Subjective workload was evaluated with the NASA Task Load Index, stress with the Short Stress State Questionnaire, and stress exposure with time-to-complete. During the heavy smoke condition, the control group showed parasympathetic withdrawal, indicating a mild stress response. The treatment group retained parasympathetic control.

Existing research has highlighted both parents' desire to receive more support. It has also been found that receiving sufficient social support enhances parenting outcomes. With the increasing popularity of mobile health apps, a Supportive Parenting App (SPA) intervention was developed to fulfill the support needs of parents during the perinatal period. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of the SPA on parental outcomes during the perinatal period. Methods: A 2-group pretest and repeated posttest randomized controlled trial was conducted wherein 200 couples (N=400 mothers and fathers) were recruited from 2 public health care institutions in Singapore. Parents were randomly assigned to intervention (100/200, 50%) or control (100/200, 50%) groups. The SPA intervention consisted of a mobile app-based psychoeducation and peer support program to support parents from pregnancy to 6 months post partum. The outcome measures included postnatal depression, anxiety, parental bonding, parental self-efficacy, perceived social support, and parenting satisfaction. Data were collected at baseline (at >24 weeks of gestation-age of viability in Singapore) and at the first, second, fourth, sixth, ninth, and 12th month post partum. Linear mixed models were used to compare parental outcomes between the groups, and a linear mixed model for repeated measures was used to examine within-group changes. Results: Parents in the intervention group mostly showed better outcomes compared with those in the control group. Parents in the intervention group had higher perceived social support than those in the control group at the first (effect size=1.59, 95% CI 0.38-2.80; Cohen standardized effect size=1.31; P=.01), second (effect size=1.98, 95% CI 1.09-2.88; Cohen standardized effect size=2.21; P=.003), and fourth (effect size=2.57, 95% CI 1.62-3.51; Cohen standardized effect size=2.72; P=.048) months post partum. However, parents in the intervention group showed significantly poorer parental bonding (effect size=1.67, 95% CI 0.24-3.11; Cohen standardized effect size=1.16; P=.02). The other parental outcomes did not differ significantly between groups. The scores of mothers and fathers also differed significantly for all outcomes except parental self-efficacy. Conclusions: Parents in the intervention group generally fared better, especially regarding perceived social support. However, the lack of statistical significance in most outcomes showed the limited effectiveness of the SPA intervention, which may be because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Parental differences in outcome scores suggest that mothers and fathers have different support needs; therefore, interventions should be tailored accordingly. Further improvements and evaluations are needed to examine the effectiveness of the SPA intervention in enhancing parental outcomes.

In particular, parental stress and social support have been found to significantly affect the growth of the newborn. Although many parents today use mobile apps to obtain more support in parenting and perinatal care, few studies have examined how these apps could affect infant development.Objective: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of the Supportive Parenting App (SPA) in improving infant developmental outcomes during the perinatal period. Methods: This study adopted a 2-group parallel prospective longitudinal design and recruited 200 infants and their parents (N=400 mothers and fathers). The parents were recruited at 24 weeks of gestation for a randomized controlled trial conducted from February 2020 to July 2022. They were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group. The infant outcome measures included cognition, language, motor skills, and social-emotional development. Data were collected from the infants when they were aged 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months. Linear and modified Poisson regressions were used to analyze the data to examine between-and within-group changes. Results: At 9 and 12 months post partum, the infants in the intervention group were found to have better communication and language skills than those in the control group. An analysis of motor development revealed that a larger proportion of the infants in the control group fell under the at-risk category, where they scored approximately 2 SDs below the normative scores. The control group infants scored higher on the problem solving domain at 6 months post partum. However, at 12 months postpartum, the infants in the intervention group performed better on cognitive tasks than those in the control group. Despite not being statistically significant, the intervention group infants were found to have consistently scored better on the social components of the questionnaires than the control group infants.Conclusions: Overall, the infants whose parents had received the SPA intervention tended to fare better in most developmental outcome measures than those whose parents had received standard care only. The findings of this study suggest that the SPA intervention exerted positive effects on the communication, cognition, motor, and socioemotional development of the infants. Further research is needed to improve the content and support provided by the intervention to maximize the benefits gained by infants and their parents.",10.2196/43885,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,infant development; parenting; mobile health technology; social support; psychoeducation; peer support; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/43885)
Evaluating the Efficacy of Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Blended With Synchronous Chat Sessions to Treat Adolescent Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Topooco, N; Byléhn, S; Nysäter, ED; Holmlund, J; Lindegaard, J; Johansson, S; Åberg, L; Nordgren, LB; Zetterqvist, M; Andersson, G",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: Depression is a common and serious problem among adolescents, but few seek or have access to therapy. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapies (ICBTs), developed to increase treatment access, show promise in reducing depression. The inclusion of coach support in treatment is desired and may be needed. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of an ICBT protocol blended with weekly real-time therapist sessions via chat; blended treatment, for adolescent depression, including major depressive episode (MDE). The protocol has previously been evaluated in a controlled study. Methods: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, adolescents 15 to 19 years of age were recruited through a community setting at the national level in Sweden (n=70) and allocated to either 8 weeks of treatment or to minimal attention control. Depression was assessed at baseline, at posttreatment, and at 12 months following treatment (in the intervention group). The primary outcome was self-reported depression level as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory II at posttreatment. The intervention was offered without the need for parental consent. Results: Over two weeks, 162 adolescents registered and completed the baseline screening. Eligible participants (n=70) were on average 17.5 years of age (SD 1.15), female (96%, 67/70), suffered from MDE (76%, 53/70), had no previous treatment experience (64%, 45/70), and reported guardian(s) to be aware about their depression state (71%, 50/70). The average intervention completion was 74% (11.8 of 16 modules and sessions). Following the treatment, ICBT participants demonstrated a significant decrease in depression symptoms compared with controls (P<.001), corresponding to a large between-group effect (intention-to-treat analysis: d=0.86, 95% CI 0.37-1.35; of completer analysis: d=0.99, 95% CI 0.48-1.51). A significant between-group effect was observed in the secondary depression outcome (P=.003); clinically significant improvement was found in 46% (16/35) of ICBT participants compared with 11% (4/35) in the control group (P=.001). Conclusions: The results are in line with our previous study, further demonstrating that adolescents with depression can successfully be engaged in and experience significant improvement following ICBT blended with therapist chat sessions.

However, few mHealth apps have been taken to scale in sub-Saharan Africa. Objective: We evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a novel, mHealth-based, and patient-centered messaging app designed using behavioral science frameworks to promote maternity service use among pregnant women in Uganda. Methods: We performed a pilot randomized controlled trial between August 2020 and May 2021 at a referral hospital in Southwestern Uganda. We included 120 adult pregnant women enrolled in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive routine antenatal care (ANC; control), scheduled SMS text or audio messages from a novel messaging prototype (scheduled messaging [SM]), and SM plus SMS text messaging reminders to 2 participant-identified social supporters (SS). Participants completed face-to-face surveys at enrollment and in the postpartum period. The primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability of the messaging prototype. Other outcomes included ANC attendance, skilled delivery, and SS. We conducted qualitative exit interviews with 15 women from each intervention arm to explore the intervention mechanisms. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using STATA and NVivo, respectively. Results: More than 85% and 75% of participants received >= 85% of the intended SMS text messages or voice calls, respectively. More than 85% of the intended messages were received within 1 hour of the expected time; 18% (7/40) of women experienced network issues for both intervention groups. Over 90% (36/40) of the intervention participants found this app useful, easy to use, engaging, and compatible and strongly recommended it to others; 70% (28/40), 78% (31/40), and 98% (39/40; P=.04) of women in the control, SM, and SS arms, respectively, had a skilled delivery. Half (20/40), 83% (33/40), and all (40/40; P=.001) of the women in the control, SM, and SS arms attended >= 4 ANC visits, respectively. Women in the SS arm reported the highest support (median 3.4, IQR 2.8-3.6; P=.02); <20% (8/40; P=.002) missed any scheduled ANC visit owing to lack of transportation.Qualitative data showed that women liked the app; they were able to comprehend ANC and skilled delivery benefits and easily share and discuss tailored information with their significant others, who in turn committed to providing them the needed support to prepare and seek help. Conclusions: We demonstrated that developing a novel patient-centered and tailored messaging app that leverages SS networks and relationships is a feasible, acceptable, and useful approach to communicate important targeted health-related information and support pregnant women in rural Southwestern Uganda to use available maternity care services.

Evaluating the effect and mechanism of upper limb motor function recovery induced by immersive virtual-reality-based rehabilitation for subacute stroke subjects: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Not mental health,"Huang, QQ; Wu, W; Chen, XL; Wu, B; Wu, LQ; Huang, XL; Jiang, SH; Huang, LJ",TRIALS,2019,"BackgroundThere is compelling evidence of beneficial effects of non-immersive virtual reality (VR)-based intervention in the rehabilitation of patients with stroke, whereby patients experience both the real world and the virtual environment. However, to date, research on immersive VR-based rehabilitation is minimal. This study aims to design a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of immersive VR-based upper extremity rehabilitation in patients with subacute stroke and explore the underlying brain mechanisms of immersive VR-based rehabilitation.MethodsSubjects (n = 60) with subacute stroke (defined as more than 1week and less than 12weeks after stroke onset) will be recruited to participate in a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either (1) an experimental intervention group, or (2) a conventional group (control). Over a 3-week time period immediately following baseline assessments and randomization, subjects in the experimental group will receive both immersive VR and conventional rehabilitation, while those in the control group will receive conventional rehabilitation only. During the rehabilitation period and over the following 12weeks, upper extremity function, cognitive function, mental status, and daily living activity performance will be evaluated in the form of questionnaires. To trace brain reorganization in which upper extremity functions previously performed by ischemic-related brain areas are assumed by other brain areas, subjects will have brain scans immediately following enrollment but before randomization, immediately following the conclusion of rehabilitation, and 12weeks after rehabilitation has concluded.DiscussionEffectiveness is assessed by evaluating motor improvement using the arm motor section of the Fugl-Meyer assessment. The study utilizes a cutting-edge brain neuroimaging approach to longitudinally trace the effectiveness of both VR-based and conventional training on stroke rehabilitation, which will hopefully describe the effects of the brain mechanisms of the intervention on recovery from stroke. Findings from the trial will greatly contribute to evidence on the use of immersive-VR-based training for stroke rehabilitation.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03086889.

However, there is a need for high-quality evidence to support implementation in clinical practice. The Kidney BEAM trial evaluated the clinical effect of a 12-week physical activity digital health intervention on health-related quality of life.Methods In a single-blind, randomised controlled trial conducted at 11 centres in the UK, adult participants (aged >= 18 years) with chronic kidney disease were recruited and randomly assigned (1:1) to the Kidney BEAM physical activity digital health intervention or a waiting list control group. Randomisation was performed with a web-based system, in randomly permuted blocks of six. Outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the difference in the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form version 1.3 Mental Component Summary (KDQoL-SF1.3 MCS) between baseline and 12 weeks. The trial was powered to detect a clinically meaningful difference of 3 arbitrary units (AU) in KDQoL-SF1.3 MCS. Outcomes were analysed by an intention-to-treat approach using an analysis of covariance model, with baseline measures and age as covariates. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04872933.Findings Between May 6, 2021, and Oct 30, 2022, 1102 individuals were assessed for eligibility, of whom 340 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to the Kidney BEAM intervention group (n=173) or the waiting list control group (n=167). 268 participants completed the trial (112 in the Kidney BEAM group and 156 in the waiting list control group). All 340 randomly assigned participants were included in the intention-to treat population. At 12 weeks, there was a significant improvement in KDQoL-SF.13 MCS score in the Kidney BEAM group (from mean 446 AU [SD 108] at baseline to 470 AU [106] at 12 weeks) compared with the waiting list control group (from 461 AU [105] to 450 AU [101]; between-group difference of 31 AU [95% CI 18-44]; p<00001).Interpretation The Kidney BEAM physical activity platform is an efficacious digital health intervention to improve mental health-related quality of life in patients with chronic kidney disease. These findings could facilitate the incorporation of remote digital health interventions into clinical practice and offer a potential intervention worthy of investigation in other chronic conditions.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

In response there has been an explosion of digital interventions such as smartphone applications (apps) to extend care. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a digital depression intervention (VMood), delivered via a smartphone app. VMood is adapted from an in-person intervention that was delivered by non-specialist providers and shown to be effective in the Vietnamese context in our previous trial (2016-2019). A stepped-wedge, randomized controlled trial will be conducted across eight provinces in Vietnam. Adults aged 18 years and over will be recruited through community-based primary care centres and screened for depression using the embedded Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (primary outcome measure). Participants scoring 10-19, indicating depression caseness, will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group until the target of 336 is reached. Secondary outcome measures will examine the effect of the intervention on commonly co-occuring anxiety, quality of life and work productivity, along with use of alcohol and tobacco products. Assessments will be administered through an online survey platform (REDCap) at baseline, and at every 3 months until 3 months post-intervention. Intervention-group participants will receive VMood for a 3-month period, with online support provided by social workers. Control-group participants will receive a limited version of the app until they cross into the intervention group. Generalized Linear Mixed-effect Models for clustered measures will be used for all outcomes data. We will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside the trial to capture VMood's costs and benefits. This trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a digital mental health intervention adapted from an in-person intervention.

Design Open-label, randomised, parallel-group controlled trial. Setting A healthcare employer in the USA. Participants 1355 daytime workers. Intervention Participants were randomised to intervention (n=794) or control (n=561) on consent. Intervention participants received the SHAW educational programme at baseline plus access to the personalised dayzz app for up to 9 months. The control condition received the intervention at month 10. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our primary outcome measures were sleep-related behavioural changes (eg, consistent sleep schedule); sleep behaviour tracked on an electronic sleep diary and sleep quality. Our secondary outcome measures included employee absenteeism, performance and productivity; stress, mood, alertness and energy; and adverse health and safety outcomes (eg, accidents). Results At follow-up, employees in the intervention condition were more likely to report increased sleep duration on work (7.20 vs 6.99, p=0.01) and on free (8.26 vs 8.04, p=0.03) nights. At follow-up, the prevalence of poor sleep quality was lower in the intervention (n=160 of 321, 50%) compared with control (n=184 of 327, 56%) (p=0.04).

Evaluating the impact of motivational interviewing on engagement and outcomes in a web-based self-help intervention for gambling disorder: A randomised controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Brazeau, BW; Cunningham, JA; Hodgins, DC",INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH,2024,"Background: Self-paced internet interventions for gambling problems offer cost-effective, accessible, and private alternatives to traditional psychotherapy for a population that rarely seeks help. However, these interventions have been relatively slow to develop, evaluate, and deploy at scale relative to those for other addictive behaviors. Moreover, user engagement remains low despite the high interest. Motivational interviews have improved the effectiveness gambling bibliotherapy but have not been augmented with an analogous web-based self-guided program. Objectives: This trial aimed to replicate and extend prior work by translating a paperback workbook to the internet and pairing it with a single motivational interview. It was hypothesized that the motivational interview would enhance program engagement and gambling outcomes. Methods: A two-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted. Treatment-seeking Canadian adults recruited solely via social media received one year of access to a web-based self-guided program, either alone (N = 158) or in combination with a virtual motivational interview completed upon enrolment (N = 155). The program was based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing. Gambling severity, expenditures, frequency, and duration were assessed via online questionnaires at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-baseline, along with secondary outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, nonspecific psychological distress, alcohol consumption). Results: Baseline characteristics were indicative of severe gambling problems and concurrent mental health problems but not problematic alcohol consumption in this sample. Both treatment groups demonstrated roughly equal improvements across all gambling outcomes and most secondary outcomes over time, except alcohol consumption, which did not meaningfully change. Changes were most prominent by 3 months, followed by more gradual change by 6 and 12 months. Only 57 % of gamblers who were assigned to receive a motivational interview completed that interview. About 40 % of users did not complete any program modules and 11 % completed all four. No group differences in program engagement were observed, although the number of modules completed was associated with greater reductions in gambling behaviors in both groups. Discussion: The problem of user engagement with web-based self-help programs remains. There is a dose-response relationship between engagement and outcomes when engagement is measured in terms of therapeutic content completed. Conclusions: The addition of a motivational interview to a web-based self-help program for gambling problems was unsuccessful in improving engagement or outcomes. Future work should aim to make self-guided programs more engaging rather than solely making users more engaged.

Evaluation of Mothers' Perceptions of a Technology-Based Supportive Educational Parenting Program (Part 2): Qualitative Study,Not Multi User,"Shorey, S; Ng, ED",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: Transitioning into parenthood can be stressful as parents struggle to cope with new parenting responsibilities. Although perinatal care in hospitals aims to improve parental outcomes, there is a general consensus that it is suboptimal and insufficient. Therefore, many studies have designed intervention methods to supplement support for parents during this stressful period. However, studies often focus on parental outcomes as indicators of their interventions' success and effectiveness. Studies evaluating participants' experiences and feedback are limited. Objective: This study aimed to examine the experiences and perceptions of participants who participated in a supportive education parenting program intervention study. Methods: A qualitative semistructured interview was conducted with 16 mothers (6 control and 10 intervention) from a randomized controlled trial. The supportive education parenting program received by the intervention group included 2 phone-based perinatal educational sessions, a phone-based educational session after childbirth, and a 1-month postpartum access to a mobile health app. The interviews were approximately 30-to 60-min long, audiotaped and transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Study findings were reported according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist. Results: The 3 main themes evaluating mothers' experiences and perceptions were generated: (1) changed perspective toward parenthood, (2) journey from pregnancy to after birth, and (3) a way forward. Mothers from the intervention group mostly had good perinatal experiences with sufficient support received, which elevated their emotional well-being and increased parenting involvement. Mothers in the control group, although satisfied with the hospital care received, were more stressed and shared a need for professional advice and extra support. Apart from technical enhancements, mothers also requested extended social support during early pregnancy up to 1 year postpartum, taking into consideration Asian cultural practices. Conclusions: Mothers who received the intervention were overall satisfied with the support provided by the technology-based supportive educational parenting program. The success of the educational program in this study highlights the need to supplement standard care in hospitals with technology-based educational programs. Future research should include fathers' perceptions to attain an in-depth understanding of overall participants' experiences and needs in the future development of supportive and educational programs.",10.2196/11065,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,education; mothers; parenting; technology,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/11065)
Evaluation of a Digital Health Tool for Titration of Basal Insulin in People With Type 2 Diabetes: Rationale and Design of a Randomized Controlled Trial,Not mental health,"Hermanns, N; Ehrmann, D; Finke-Gröne, K; Roos, T; Freckmann, G; Kulzer, B",JOURNAL OF DIABETES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,2023,"Background: Optimal insulin titration is essential in helping people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to achieve adequate glycemic control. Barriers of people with diabetes to implementation of titration include lack of self-efficiency and self-management skills, increased diabetes-related distress, low treatment satisfaction, poor well-being, as well as concerns about hypoglycemia and insulin overdose. My Dose Coach is a digital health tool for optimizing titration of basal insulin that combines a smartphone app for patients with T2DM and a Web portal for health care professionals. Methods/Design: This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled parallel study conducted in approximately 50 centers in Germany that are specialized in the treatment of diabetes. Patients in the intervention group will use the titration app and will be registered on the Web portal by their treating physician. Control group patients will continue their current basal insulin titration without using the app. The primary outcome is the mean change in HbA1c levels at the 12-week follow-up. The secondary outcome measures include patient-reported outcomes such as diabetes-related distress, self-management, empowerment, self-efficacy, treatment satisfaction, and psychological well-being as well as fasting blood glucose values.

Evaluation of a Technology-Based Peer-Support Intervention Program for Preventing Postnatal Depression (Part 1): Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Shorey, S; Chee, CYI; Ng, ED; Lau, Y; Dennis, CL; Chan, YH",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: The frenzy of postbirth events often takes a toll on mothers' mental well-being, leaving them susceptible to postpartum psychological disorders such as postnatal depression (PND). Social support has been found to be effective in restoring the emotional well-being of new mothers. Therefore, mothers need to be supported during the crucial postpartum period to buffer the negative after effects of childbirth and to promote healthier maternal well-being. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a technology-based peer-support intervention program (PIP) on maternal outcomes during the early postpartum period. Methods: A randomized, parallel-armed controlled trial was conducted. The study recruited 138 mothers (69 in intervention group, 69 in control group) at risk of PND from a tertiary hospital in Singapore. To support these mothers, 20 peer volunteers were recruited by word of mouth and trained by a psychiatrist in social support skills before the intervention commenced. The 4-week-long intervention included a weekly follow-up with a peer volunteer through phone calls or text messages. The intervention group received peer support in addition to the standard care offered by the hospital. The control group only received postnatal standard care. Maternal outcomes (PND, postnatal anxiety [PNA], loneliness, and perceived social support) were measured with reliable and valid instruments. Data were collected immediately postpartum, at 1 month postpartum and at 3 months postpartum. The general linear model was used to compare the groups for postpartum percentage changes in the outcome variables at first and third months, and the linear mixed model was used to compare the trend over the study period. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores (d=-2.11; 95% CI -4.0 to -0.3; P=.03) between the intervention and control groups at 3 months postpartum after adjusting for covariates. The intervention group had a significant change over time compared with the control group. Conclusions: The technology-based PIP was found to be effective in reducing the risk of PND among new mothers and showed a generally positive trend in reducing PNA and loneliness and increasing perceived social support.

Evaluation of a Technology-Based Peer-Support Intervention Program for Preventing Postnatal Depression (Part 2): Qualitative Study,Good,"Shorey, S; Ng, ED",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2019,"Background: Social support is known to reduce risks of postnatal depression (PND) and improve maternal emotional well-being. However, the Asian cultural context is often neglected when appraising maternal needs and mothers' preferences for social support. While many preventive efforts have experimented with technology, professionals, and paraprofessionals in providing social support to mothers in need, most studies determined the effectiveness of their interventions through quantitative measurements of maternal outcomes. Experiences and feedback from both participants and administrators are rarely discussed, especially in an Asian setting. Objective: The goal of the research was to evaluate the postnatal experiences of Asian mothers at risk of PND and the perceptions of peer volunteers regarding a technology-based peer-support intervention program (PIP). Methods: A qualitative semistructured interview was conducted with 20 Asian mothers at risk of depression (10 from the control group and 10 from the intervention group) and 19 peer volunteers from a randomized controlled trial. The PIP included weekly correspondence between peer volunteers and mothers through any telecommunication means over 4 weeks. All interviews were approximately 30 to 60 minutes long, audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Study findings were reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials checklist. Results: Two overarching themes comprising five subthemes were generated: postnatal experience (a bouncy ride, a way forward) and evaluation of the PIP (valuable, flexible, and supportive program; building blocks of a good relationship; and lessons learned and the road ahead). Mothers from both the control and interventions groups were generally satisfied with hospital care and the support received from family. They also shared similar breastfeeding challenges and needs for more informed decisions and follow-up support from the hospital. However, mothers who received the PIP tended to have more positive outlooks of their birth experiences. Overall, peer volunteers and mothers involved in the PIP found the PIP useful and expressed satisfaction with the program's flexibility. They also shared their personal takeaways, the qualities of their friendships, and the need for extended correspondence time and recommended outreach to non-at-risk mothers. Conclusions: The positive endorsement of the PIP by peer volunteers and mothers suggests the success of the PIP in maintaining positive maternal emotional well-being during the postpartum period. With the help of technology, hospitals can easily provide additional peer support to at-risk mothers in addition to existing standard care offered to these mothers.",10.2196/12915,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,depression; mothers; postpartum; qualitative; social support; telecommunication; digital health; peer support; peer-to-peer support; online support groups; internet,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/12915)
Evaluation of a short in-person and online antenatal educational intervention for high-risk pregnant women linked to antenatal consultation,Other,"Heim, MA; Makuch, MY",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY,2024,"INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to evaluate a short educational intervention that focused on labor pain (through visual analogue scale, VAS), postpartum anxiety, and birthing experience before and during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS This was a quasi-experimental study conducted between November 2019 and May 2021 in Brazil in 100 women with a high-risk pregnancy in the third trimester of pregnancy with an intervention group with in- person or virtual sessions (during the COVID-19 pandemic) and a non-intervention group. The antenatal intervention included breathing and relaxation techniques, upright positions, and information about labor. For evaluation, an antenatal questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and a postpartum questionnaire were used. For data analysis, Student's t-test, chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests, ANOVA, bivariate, and multivariate regression analysis, were used. RESULTS When comparing the women in the intervention group to the non-intervention group, it was observed that the latter group reported higher fear of pain at labor during antenatal consultations (p< 0.013); more women needed analgesia at 0-4 cm dilation (17/40) (p<0.018); the duration of labor was >= 12 hours (37/50) (p<0.037); while the intervention reported having a regular, good or excellent labor period (36/50) (p=0.014). The multiple regression analysis for labor pain showed a significant relationship between mode of delivery (cesarean delivery: RR; SE -21.43; 5.32, p<0.001) and labor pain, and good satisfaction with labor (RR; SE -13.86; 6.40, p=0.033).

Evaluation of a stand-alone mobile mindfulness app in people experiencing infertility: the protocol for an exploratory randomised controlled trial (MoMiFer-RCT),Not Multi User,"Boedt, T; Willaert, N; Fong, SL; Dancet, E; Spiessens, C; Raes, F; Matthys, C; Van der Gucht, K",BMJ OPEN,2022,"Introduction Infertility and its treatment bring a considerable emotional burden. Increasing evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of smartphone-delivered mindfulness apps for reducing symptoms of emotional distress in both clinical and non-clinical populations. Evidence on this topic in women, men and couples experiencing infertility is currently under-represented. The aim of the MoMiFer study is, therefore, to investigate the efficacy of a stand-alone mobile mindfulness app on symptoms of emotional distress and fertility-related quality of life in people experiencing infertility. Methods and analysis This study is an exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) with open enrollment. The primary outcomes are symptoms of emotional distress and fertility-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes are mindfulness skills, repetitive negative thinking, self-compassion, user-rated quality of the stand-alone mobile mindfulness app and use of the app. Experience sampling method and standardised self-report questionnaires are combined within a repeated measures design to measure the effects of the stand-alone mobile mindfulness app on the primary and secondary outcomes, apart from the use of the app. The latter will be evaluated through app tracking. People, including women, men and couples, experiencing infertility (n=60) will be randomised to an intervention group receiving the stand-alone mobile mindfulness app for 3 months or a wait-list control group. The app follows the format and content of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. Data will be collected at baseline, at 1.5 months and 3 months after randomisation. Analysis will be according to intention to treat and based on general linear modelling and multilevel mixed-effects modelling.

Several studies have linked higher expectations to better treatment success. Therefore, we want to evaluate the impact of a targeted video-based intervention on patients' expectations and the treatment success of inpatient rehabilitation. Methods/design: All patients who will be referred to inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation in three clinics will receive a study flyer with information about how to log in to the study platform together with the usual clinic information leaflet. Patients will receive the study information and informed consent upon login and will be randomized into the intervention or the control group. The intervention group (n = 394) will get access to our virtual online clinic, containing several videos about inpatient rehabilitation, until their admission to inpatient rehabilitation. The control group (n = 394) will receive no special treatment preparation.

Evaluation of an App-Delivered Psychological Flexibility Skill Training Intervention for Medical Student Burnout and Well-being: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not mental health,"Ditton, E; Knott, B; Hodyl, N; Horton, G; Oldmeadow, C; Walker, FR; Nilsson, M",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2023,"Background: Physician burnout is a common problem, with onset frequently occurring during undergraduate education. Early intervention strategies that train medical students in psychological flexibility skills could support well-being and mitigate burnout risks associated with unmodifiable career stressors. There is a need for randomized controlled trials to assess effectiveness. As psychological flexibility varies contextually and among individuals, tailoring interventions may improve outcomes. Smartphone apps can facilitate individualization and accessibility, and the evaluation of this approach is an identified research priority.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a stand-alone app-delivered Acceptance and Commitment Training intervention for improving medical students' self-reported burnout, well-being, psychological flexibility, and psychological distress outcomes. We aimed to explore whether an individualized app would demonstrate benefits over a nonindividualized version.Methods: This parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted with a sample of medical students from 2 Australian universities (N=143). Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 intervention arms (individualized, nonindividualized, and waitlist) using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Individualized and nonindividualized participants were blinded to group allocation. The 5-week intervention included an introductory module (stage 1) and on-demand access to short skill training activities (stage 2), which students accessed at their own pace. Stage 2 was either nonindividualized or individualized to meet students' identified psychological flexibility training needs. Results: The mean differences in change from baseline between the intervention groups and the waitlist group were not statistically significant for burnout outcomes: exhaustion (primary; individualized: -0.52, 95% CI -3.70 to 2.65, P=.75; nonindividualized: 1.60, 95% CI -1.84 to 5.03, P=.37), cynicism (individualized: -1.26, 95% CI -4.46 to 1.94, P=.44; nonindividualized: 1.00, 95% CI -2.45 to 4.46, P=.57), and academic efficacy (individualized: 0.94, 95% CI -0.90 to 2.79, P=.32; nonindividualized: 2.02, 95% CI 0.02-4.03, P=.05). Following the intervention, the individualized group demonstrated improved psychological flexibility (0.50, 95% CI 0.12-0.89; P=.01), reduced inflexibility (0.48, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.04; P=.04), and reduced stress (-6.89, 95% CI -12.01 to 5.99; P=.01), and the nonindividualized group demonstrated improved well-being (6.46, 95% CI 0.49-12.42; P=.04) and stress (-6.36, 95% CI -11.90 to -0.83; P=.03) compared with waitlist participants. Between-group differences for the individualized and nonindividualized arms were not statistically significant. High attrition (75/143, 52.4%) was observed. Conclusions: This trial provides early support for the potential benefits of Acceptance and Commitment Training for medical student well-being and psychological outcomes and demonstrates that psychological flexibility and inflexibility can be trained using a smartphone app. Although postintervention burnout outcomes were not statistically significant, improvements in secondary outcomes could indicate early risk mitigation. Replication studies with larger samples and longer-term follow-up are required, and future research should focus on improving implementation frameworks to increase engagement and optimize individualization methods.

"Evaluation of an individualized, tablet-based physiotherapy training programme for patients with Parkinson's disease: the ParkProTrain study, a quasi-randomised controlled trial",Not Multi User,"Wagner, L; Hauptmann, B; Hoffmann, AK; Jochems, N; Schmeier, B; Schrader, A; Kohlmann, T; Deck, R",BMC NEUROLOGY,2022,"Background Regular physical activity is of great relevance in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is part of the inpatient multimodal Parkinson's complex treatment (MKP) in Germany. However, there is often a lack of human resources in outpatient settings to continue an interprofessional approach. A large proportion of PD patients live a predominantly sedentary lifestyle and do not get enough exercise. Methods The intervention group (IG) used a tablet-based physiotherapy training programme at home for a period of nine months. We conducted a quasi-randomised longitudinal study with three measurement times (at the beginning (t(0)) and end of MKP (t(1)) and at 9 months after MKP (t(2))). The primary outcome measured was PD-specific quality of life using the PDQ-8. The secondary outcome focused on participation restrictions, falling anxiety, sleep disorder, anxiety and depression as well as comorbidity, pain, performance capability and physical activity. Results For n = 93 IG and n = 137 control group (CG) patients, evaluable cases were available for all measurement times. Both groups achieved significant improvements in all parameters at the end of MKP. These parameters deteriorated again at nine months after MKP for most parameters and were even below the baseline levels. However, this deterioration was less pronounced in the IG than in the CG. For general health and social participation, a significant slightly positive effect was observed in the IG nine months after MKP when compared with the baseline level. Paying attention to physical activity slightly increased in the IG for the catamnesis survey compared to baseline. Nearly all IG patients were satisfied with the intervention, especially with the consultations with the physiotherapist. Conclusions Although the expected extent of effects could not be determined for the IG, stabilisation effects could be demonstrated. These stabilisation effects shown for the IG might be attributed to the intervention. The effects might have been greater without the COVID-19 pandemic. Trial registration.

Evaluation of nonpharmacologic methods of pain and anxiety management for laceration repair in the pediatric emergency department,Not Multi User,"Sinha, M; Christopher, NC; Fenn, R; Reeves, L",PEDIATRICS,2006,"BACKGROUND. Nonpharmacologic interventions, such as distraction, have been shown to be powerful adjuncts in reducing pain and anxiety in children with both acute and chronic painful conditions. There are no controlled studies evaluating these interventions as adjuncts to facilitate completion of painful procedures in the pediatric emergency department (ED). OBJECTIVE. We assessed the effectiveness of distraction techniques in reducing the sensory and affective components of pain among pediatric patients undergoing laceration repair in the ED. METHODS. Eligible children between 6 and 18 years of age (N = 240) presenting to the ED for laceration repair were randomly assigned to an intervention or control arm. Those assigned to the intervention arm were given a choice of age-appropriate distracters during laceration repair. Quantitative measures of pain intensity, situational anxiety, and pain distress ( as perceived by the parent) were assessed by using the 7-point Facial Pain Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, and a visual analog scale, respectively, before and after laceration repair. The State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children was performed in children >= 10 years of age. RESULTS. There was no difference in mean change in Facial Pain Scale scores between the control and the intervention groups in children < 10 years of age. Multivariate analysis in this same age group showed that the intervention was independently associated with a reduction in pain distress as perceived by parents based on the mean change in visual analog scale scores. In older children, the intervention was independently associated with reduction in situational anxiety but not in pain intensity or in parental perception of pain distress. CONCLUSIONS. The use of distraction techniques is effective in reducing situational anxiety in older children and lowering parental perception of pain distress in younger children. This technique may have a role in improving the quality of management of procedural pain in a pediatric ED setting.",10.1542/peds.2005-1100,wos,Pediatrics,children; pain; distraction; emergency,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2005-1100)
Evaluation of smartphone APP-based case-management services among antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-positive men who have sex with men: a randomized controlled trial protocol,Other,"Fan, XY; She, R; Liu, C; Zhong, HD; Lau, JTF; Hao, C; Li, JH; Hao, YT; Li, LH; Gu, J",BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,2020,"Background Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionally affected by HIV in China. 'Treatment as Prevention' is a promising strategy for HIV prevention but requires adequate adherence. Mobile health (mHealth) may be an acceptable and feasible approach for service delivery, but there is little evidence supporting mHealth intervention for improving antiretroviral treatment adherence among HIV-infected MSM in low- and middle-income countries, including China. This study will aim to develop a smartphone application-based case-management service and compare its efficacy to standard care with regards to adherence, CD4, HIV viral load and psychosocial outcomes among MSM patients in Guangzhou, China. Methods A non-blinded 1:1 parallel-group randomised controlled trial will be conducted in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, with 300 MSM enrolled in each arm. Eligible MSM who are newly initiating ART will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (standard-of-care case management plus mHealth intervention) or a control group (standard-of-care case management). The development of the mHealth intervention will be based on the information-motivation-behavioural skills theory of ART adherence, and comprise four components: educational articles, one-to-one online communication with case managers, support-service information and hospital-visit reminders. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, and 12. The primary outcomes will be ART adherence and CD4 count at month 6. Secondary outcomes include HIV RNA, sexual behaviours, mental health status, illness perceptions, and quality of life. chi(2) test and t-test will be used for between-group comparisons. Intervention effects will be evaluated using General estimating equation performed by SAS 9.0, on the principle of intention-to-treat. Structural equation modelling will be used to test potential mechanisms of intervention effect.

Evaluation of the Combined Treatment Approach Robin (Standardized Manual and Smartphone App) for Adolescents at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis,Not Multi User,"Traber-Walker, N; Gerstenberg, M; Metzler, S; Joris, MR; Karr, M; Studer, N; Logoz, MZ; Roth, A; Rössler, W; Walitza, S; Franscini, M",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2019,"Introduction: The prevention of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders has led researchers to focus on early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis and to treat the at-risk symptoms in the pre-psychotic period. Although at-risk symptoms such as attenuated hallucinations or delusions are common in adolescents and associated with a marked reduction in global functioning, the evidence base of effective interventions for adolescents at CHR state and even first-episode psychosis is limited. Thus, the present protocol describes a study design that combines therapy modules for CHR adolescents with a smartphone application supporting the young individuals between the therapy sessions. The treatment approach Robin is based on existing therapy strategies for adolescents with first episode of psychosis and the available recommendations for adults with at-risk symptoms. Methods: The evaluation aims firstly to compare the efficacy of Robin in 30 CHR adolescents aged 14-18 to an active control group (treatment as usual) from a previous study. Primary outcome measures will be at-risk symptomatology, comorbid diagnosis, functioning, self-efficacy, and quality of life. For the prospective intervention condition (16 weekly individual sessions + a minimum 4 family sessions), help-seeking adolescents with CHR for psychosis, aged 14-18, will be recruited over 3 years. At-risk and comorbid symptoms, functioning, self-efficacy, and quality of life are monitored at six time points (baseline, during the treatment period; immediately after intervention; and 6, 12, and 24 months later) and compared with the respective measures of the active control group. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial to test the efficacy of a specific early psychosis treatment in combination with a smartphone application for adolescents at CHR for developing psychosis. The results of the study are expected to add information that may substantially decrease the burden of CHR adolescents and increase their resilience.

Providing information and training via social media alleviates anxiety and boost satisfaction among patients' relatives. This research was conducted to evaluate the effects of social media-based training on anxiety and satisfaction among the family members of patients at the intensive care unit (ICU) following coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Methods: In the present quasi-experimental research, the study population was divided into intervention and control groups. Data were collected on 100 family members of patients at the ICU after CABG in the year 2017. The sample was selected via the convenience sampling method in Rajaie Cardiovascular, Medical, and Research center. The intervention group became members of a Telegram channel and subsequently received information about CABG and postoperative treatments through this channel. For the control group, however, only traditional methods were performed. For data collection, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire and and ICU family satisfaction questionnaire were used. The data were analyzed in SPSS. Results: Based on the findings, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups before the intervention. However, after the intervention, the average score for the STAI questionnaire showed a significant drop and the amount of satisfaction after receiving information exhibited a significant rise in the intervention group, as compared with the control group (P < 0/0001). Conclusions: Based on our findings, social media-based training confers increased satisfaction and reduced anxiety among the family members of post-CABG patients at the ICU.",NA,wos,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,Coronary artery bypass surgery; Anxiety; Satisfaction; Virtual media; Social media; Family-centered care,URI::(https://www.doi.org/NA)

Patients suffering from depressive disorders report a lower quality of life (QOL) than people without a history of mental health issues. Internet-based interventions (IBIs) based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are effective in reducing symptom severity but data on their impact on quality of life in clinically depressed patients so far is scarce. Methods Selfapy is a CBT-based IBI for depressive disorders. 401 participants (332 female, mean age 37 (SD = 11) with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymia were enrolled in a randomized, parallel, three-arm trial comparing a therapist-guided Selfapy intervention with an unguided Selfapy intervention and a waiting list control. QOL was measured using the WHOQOL-BREF at baseline, post-treatment (12 weeks) and at 24-week follow-up. The effects of the interventions on QOL were calculated using linear mixed effects models. Results At post-treatment (12 weeks) the guided and unguided intervention groups reported an increase in QOL on physical and psychological health domains compared to controls (significant group*time interaction). The gain in QOL was maintained over the follow-up period only for psychological health. QOL decreased in the social relationships and environment domains over the course of treatment and during the follow-up treatment for all participants. There were no differences between the guided and the unguided intervention. Conclusion Selfapy proved to positively affect psychological and physical QOL in a sample of participants suffering from depressive disorders and can therefore be considered an effective and highly scalable therapeutic tool.

Evaluation of the quality of collaboration between the client and the therapist in phobia treatments,Not Digital,"Wrzesien, M; Burkhardt, JM; Botella, C; Alcañiz, M",INTERACTING WITH COMPUTERS,2012,"A growing number of empirical studies evaluate the influence of Mental Health (MH) technology on the clinical effectiveness, the therapeutic relationship (i.e., therapeutic alliance), and usability issues. However, to the authors' knowledge, no studies have yet been performed regarding the influence of technology on the therapeutic process in terms of collaboration. This study evaluates the quality of collaboration between the client and therapist in Augmented Reality Exposure Therapy (ARET) context and the traditional, In Vivo Exposure Therapy (IVET) context with the Therapeutic Collaborative Scale (TCS). Twenty participants received an intensive session of cognitive behavioral therapy in either a technology-mediated therapeutic context or in a traditional therapeutic context. The results indicate that both therapeutic conditions show high collaboration scores. However, the asymmetry of roles between the therapist and the client under both conditions were detected. Also, a greater level of distraction was observed for therapists in ARET, which affected the quality of the therapists' involvement in the therapeutic session. The implications of these results are discussed. (C) 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

Although digital tools may help mitigate this issue, critics have suggested that technological solutions that lack human empathy will prevent a bond or therapeutic alliance from being formed, thereby narrowing these solutions' efficacy. Objective: We aimed to investigate whether users of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based conversational agent would report therapeutic bond levels that are similar to those in literature about other CBT modalities, including face-to-face therapy, group CBT, and other digital interventions that do not use a conversational agent. Methods: A cross-sectional, retrospective study design was used to analyze aggregate, deidentified data from adult users who self-referred to a CBT-based, fully automated conversational agent (Woebot) between November 2019 and August 2020. Working alliance was measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), and depression symptom status was assessed by using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). All measures were administered by the conversational agent in the mobile app. WAI-SR scores were compared to those in scientific literature abstracted from recent reviews. Results: Data from 36,070 Woebot users were included in the analysis. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years, and 57.48% (20,734/36,070) of participants reported that they were female. The mean PHQ-2 score was 3.03 (SD 1.79), and 54.67% (19,719/36,070) of users scored over the cutoff score of 3 for depression screening. Within 5 days of initial app use, the mean WAI-SR score was 3.36 (SD 0.8) and the mean bond subscale score was 3.8 (SD 1.0), which was comparable to those in recent studies from the literature on traditional, outpatient, individual CBT and group CBT (mean bond subscale scores of 4 and 3.8, respectively). PHQ-2 scores at baseline weakly correlated with bond scores (r=-0.04; P<.001); however, users with depression and those without depression had high bond scores of 3.45. Conclusions: Although bonds are often presumed to be the exclusive domain of human therapeutic relationships, our findings challenge the notion that digital therapeutics are incapable of establishing a therapeutic bond with users. Future research might investigate the role of bonds as mediators of clinical outcomes, since boosting the engagement and efficacy of digital therapeutics could have major public health benefits.",10.2196/27868,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,conversational agents; mobile mental health; chatbots; depression; anxiety; digital health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/27868)
Evidence-based digital support during 1 year after an Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Programme for persons with chronic musculoskeletal pain to facilitate a sustainable return to work: a study protocol for a registry-based multicentre randomised controlled trial,Not mental health,"Turesson, C; Liedberg, G; Vixner, L; Lofgren, M; Björk, M",BMJ OPEN,2022,"Introduction Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP) severely affects the individual's quality of life, functioning and ability to work, and comes with significant societal costs for sick leave and productivity loss. After rehabilitation, patients with CMSP often experience lack of support when responsibility for the return-to-work process is taken over by the employer. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital support (Sustainable WorkEr digital support for Persons with chronic Pain and their Employers (SWEPPE)) for promoting a sustainable return-to-work for persons with CMSP and to facilitate the employers' supportive role and responsibilities in the process. Methods and analysis In this registry-based multicentre randomised controlled trial, 360 patients with CMSP will be randomised to either receive the smartphone application SWEPPE (n=180) or to a control group (n=180). The intervention group will use SWEPPE for 1 year and the control group will not receive any intervention for return to work (RTW). Participants will be recruited from approximately 10 specialist and primary care level units connected to the Swedish National Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation providing Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Programmes (IPRP) for CMSP. Eligibility criteria are age 18-65 years and a need for support in RTW or continued support at work for creating a sustainable work situation.

Examining TikTok's Potential for Community-Engaged Digital Knowledge Mobilization With Equity-Seeking Groups,Other,"MacKinnon, KR; Kia, H; Lacombe-Duncan, A",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2021,"Social media is increasingly being leveraged by researchers to engage in public debates and rapidly disseminate research results to health care providers, health care users, policy makers, educators, and the general public. This paper contributes to the growing literature on the use of social media for digital knowledge mobilization, drawing particular attention to TikTok and its unique potential for collaborative knowledge mobilization with underserved communities who experience barriers to health care and health inequities (eg, equity-seeking groups). Setting the TikTok platform apart from other social media are the unique audiovisual video editing tools, together with an impactful algorithm, that make knowledge dissemination and exchange with large global audiences possible. As an example, we will discuss digital knowledge mobilization with trans and nonbinary (trans) communities, a population that experiences barriers to health care and is engaged in significant peer-to-peer health information sharing on the web. To demonstrate, analytics data from 13 selected TikTok videos on the topic of research on gender-affirming medicine (eg, hormonal therapy and surgeries) are presented to illustrate how knowledge is disseminated within the trans community via TikTok. Considerations for researchers planning to use TikTok for digital knowledge mobilization and other related community engagement with equity-seeking groups are also discussed. These include the limitations of TikTok analytics data for measuring knowledge mobilization, population-specific concerns related to community safety on social media, the spread of disinformation, barriers to internet access, and commercialization and intellectual property issues. This paper concludes that TikTok is an innovative social media platform that presents possibilities for achieving transformative, community-engaged knowledge mobilization among researchers, underserved health care users, and their health care providers, all of whom are necessary to achieve better health care and population health outcomes.",10.2196/30315,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,trans; nonbinary; marginalized communities; gender-affirming care; digital health; community-engaged research; knowledge mobilization; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/30315)

Examining the Effectiveness of Gamification in Mental Health Apps for Depression: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,Good,"Six, SG; Byrne, KA; Tibbett, TP; Pericot-Valverde, I",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2021,"Background: Previous research showed that computerized cognitive behavioral therapy can effectively reduce depressive symptoms. Some mental health apps incorporate gamification into their app design, yet it is unclear whether features differ in their effectiveness to reduce depressive symptoms over and above mental health apps without gamification. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether mental health apps with gamification elements differ in their effectiveness to reduce depressive symptoms when compared to those that lack these elements. Methods: A meta-analysis of studies that examined the effect of app-based therapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness, on depressive symptoms was performed. A total of 5597 articles were identified via five databases. After screening, 38 studies (n=8110 participants) remained for data extraction. From these studies, 50 total comparisons between postintervention mental health app intervention groups and control groups were included in the meta-analysis. Results: A random effects model was performed to examine the effect of mental health apps on depressive symptoms compared to controls. The number of gamification elements within the apps was included as a moderator. Results indicated a small to moderate effect size across all mental health apps in which the mental health app intervention effectively reduced depressive symptoms compared to controls (Hedges g=-0.27, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.17; P<.001). The gamification moderator was not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms (beta=-0.03, SE=0.03; P=.38), demonstrating no significant difference in effectiveness between mental health apps with and without gamification features. A separate meta-regression also did not show an effect of gamification elements on intervention adherence (beta=-1.93, SE=2.28; P=.40). YConclusions: The results show that both mental health apps with and without gamification elements were effective in reducing depressive symptoms. There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of mental health apps with gamification elements on depressive symptoms or adherence.

Examining the effectiveness and acceptability of a group-based ACT intervention delivered by videoconference to international university students during the COVID-19 pandemic,Good,"Brandolin, F; Lappalainen, P; Gorinelli, S; Muotka, J; Lappalainen, R",COUNSELLING PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY,2023,"Studies have shown that international students are at increased risk of experiencing poor mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has had further negative impacts on the psychological well-being of students. In this quasi-experimental study, we examined the impact of a brief acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) -based group intervention delivered by videoconference (ACT videoconference; n = 48). We used an equivalent in-person group intervention administrated prior to the pandemic as a reference group (ACT face-to-face; n = 53). In addition, we investigated the exposure - response relationship, dropout attrition, acceptability, and user experiences. International university students participated in five online group meetings using a videoconferencing app during the COVID-19 pandemic and were compared with students participating in five face-to-face group meetings prior to the pandemic. Symptoms (stress, anxiety, depression) and process measures (psychological inflexibility, mindfulness, engaged living) indicated similar positive changes in both groups (e.g. PSS-10, ACT videoconference dw = 0.54; ACT face-to face dw = 0.94; AFQ-Y, ACT videoconference dw = 0.55; ACT face-to-face, dw = 0.84), with a slightly larger effect in the ACT face-to-face group.

Exclusion-Proneness in Borderline Personality Disorder Inpatients Impairs Alliance in Mentalization-Based Group Therapy,Not Multi User,"Euler, S; Wrege, J; Busmann, M; Lindenmeyer, HJ; Sollberger, D; Lang, UE; Gaab, J; Walter, M",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2018,"Interpersonal sensitivity, particularly threat of potential exclusion, is a critical condition in borderline personality disorder (BPD) which impairs patients' social adjustment. Current evidence-based treatments include group components, such as mentalization-based group therapy (MBT-G), in order to improve interpersonal functioning. These treatments additionally focus on the therapeutic alliance since it was discovered to be a robust predictor of treatment outcome. However, alliance is a multidimensional factor of group therapy, which includes the fellow patients, and may thus be negatively affected by the exclusion-proneness of BPD patients. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the predictive value of threat of social exclusion for the therapeutic alliance in MBT-G. In the first part of the study, social exclusion was experimentally induced in 23 BPD inpatients and 28 healthy subjects using the Cyberball paradigm, a virtual ball tossing game. The evoked level of threat was measured with the Need-Threat Scale (NTS) which captures four dimensions of fundamental human needs, i.e., the need for belongingness, for self-esteem, for control, and for a meaningful existence. In the second part of the study, therapeutic alliance was measured on three dimensions, the therapists, the fellow patients and the group as a whole, using the Group-Questionnaire (GQ-D). BPD patients scored higher in their level of threat according to the NTS in both, the inclusion and the exclusion condition. The level of threat after exclusion predicted impairments of the therapeutic alliance in MBT-G. It was associated with more negative relationships, lower positive bonding and a lower positive working alliance with the fellow patients and lower positive bonding to the group as a whole whilst no negative prediction of the alliance to the therapists was found. Consequently, our translational study design has shown that Cyberball is an appropriate tool to use as an approach for clinical questions. We further conclude that exclusion-proneness in BPD is a critical feature with respect to alliance in group treatments. In order to neutralize BPD patients' exclusion bias, therapists may be advised to provide an inclusive stance, especially in initial sessions. It is also recommendable to strengthen patient to patient relations.",10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00824,wos,Psychology,borderline personality disorder; Cyberball; social exclusion; Need Threat Scale; mentalization-based group therapy; therapeutic alliance,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00824)
Exercise- and strategy-based physiotherapy-delivered intervention for preventing repeat falls in people with Parkinson's: the PDSAFE RCT,Not mental health,"Ashburn, A; Pickering, R; McIntosh, E; Hulbert, S; Rochester, L; Roberts, HC; Nieuwboer, A; Kunkel, D; Goodwin, VA; Lamb, SE; Ballinger, C; Seymour, KC",HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT,2019,"Background: People with Parkinson's disease are twice as likely to experience a fall as a healthy older person, often leading to debilitating effects on confidence, activity levels and quality of life. Objective: To estimate the effect of a physiotherapy programme for fall prevention among people with Parkinson's disease. Design: A multicentre, pragmatic, investigator-masked, individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) with prespecified subgroup analyses. Setting: Recruitment from NHS hospitals and clinics and community and social services in eight English regions with home-based interventions. Participants: A total of 474 people with Parkinson's disease (i.e. Hoehn and Yahr scale stages 1-4) were recruited: 238 were assigned to a physiotherapy programme and 236 were assigned to usual care. Random allocation was 50 : 50. Intervention: All participants received routine care; the usual-care group received an information digital versatile disc (DVD) and a single advice session at trial completion. The intervention group had an individually tailored, progressive, home-based fall avoidance strategy training programme with balance and strengthening exercises: PDSAFE. Main outcome measure: The primary outcome was the risk of repeat falling, collected by self-report monthly diaries between 0 and 6 months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes included near-falls, falls efficacy, freezing of gait (FoG), health-related quality of life, and measurements taken using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest), the Chair Stand Test (CST), the Geriatric Depression Scale, the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire. Results: PDSAFE is the largest RCT of falls management among people with Parkinson's disease: 541 patients were screened for eligibility. The average age was 72 years, and 266 out of 474 (56%) participants were men. Of the 474 randomised participants, 238 were randomised to the intervention group and 236 were randomised to the control group. No difference in repeat falling within 6 months of randomisation was found [PDSAFE group to control group odds ratio (OR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.98; p = 0.447]. An analysis of secondary outcomes demonstrated better balance (Mini-BESTest: mean difference 0.95, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.67; p = 0.009), functional strength (CST: p = 0.041) and falls efficacy (Falls Efficacy Scale - International: mean difference 1.6, 95% CI -3.0 to -0.19; p = 0.026) with near-falling significantly reduced with PDSAFE (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; p = 0.001) at 6 months. Prespecified subgroup analysis (i.e. disease severity and FoG) revealed a PDSAFE differing effect; the intervention may be of benefit for people with moderate disease but may increase falling for those in the more severe category, especially those with FoG. Limitations: All participants were assessed at primary outcome; only 73% were assessed at 12 months owing to restricted funding. Conclusions: PDSAFE was not effective in reducing repeat falling across the range of people with Parkinson's disease in the trial. Secondary analysis demonstrated that other functional tasks and self-efficacy improved and demonstrated differential patterns of intervention impact in accordance with disease severity and FoG, which supports previous secondary research findings and merits further primary evaluation.

Conventional therapies have been supplemented with technological advancements like virtual reality (VR) and exergaming, providing engaging, multisensory rehabilitation options. Objective: This study aimed to synthesize evidence on exergaming's role in multiple sclerosis treatment, particularly to evaluate the impact of exergaming on cognitive, motor, and psychological outcomes in patients with multiple sclerosis. Methods: A systematic review and subsequent meta -analysis design were employed. An extensive search was conducted up to June 2023 across five electronic databases - Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE. The data extraction process from the selected studies was conducted independently. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool 1 (ROB1) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) assessment tool. Continuous outcomes were consolidated as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta -analyses were performed using RevMan ver. 5.4. Results: Out of 1,029 studies, 27 were included for meta -analysis. There were no significant differences in cognitive outcomes between the exergaming and the no -intervention group or the Conventional Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation interventions (CPRh) subgroups. However, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) showed a statistically significant difference in favor of exergaming in the no -intervention subgroup (MD = 5.40, 95% CI [0.08, 10.72], p = 0.05). In motor outcomes, exergaming only demonstrated better results in the 6 -minute walking test compared to the no -intervention group (MD = 25.53, 95% CI [6.87, 44.19], p = 0.007). The Berg Balance Scale score in both studied subgroups and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test in the no -intervention group favored exergaming. In terms of psychological outcomes, the Beck Depression Inventory did not reveal any significant differences, while the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) score favored exergaming in the CPRh subgroup. Conclusion: Exergaming shows promise for enhancing cognitive and motor functions, motivation, adherence, and quality of life in MS patients, which is beneficial for nurses.

"Experiences and perceptions of nurses participating in an interprofessional, videoconference-based educational programme on concurrent mental health and substance use disorders: a qualitative study",Other,"Chicoine, G; Côté, J; Pepin, J; Boyer, L; Rouleau, G; Jutras-Aswad, D",BMC NURSING,2022,"Background Individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (i.e., concurrent disorders) have complex healthcare needs, which can be challenging for nurses to manage. Providing optimal care for this subpopulation requires nurses to develop high-level competencies despite limited resources at their disposal and the isolated settings in which many of them work. The Extension for Healthcare Community Outcomes (ECHO (R)) is a promising collaborative learning and capacity building model that uses videoconference technology to support and train healthcare professionals in the management of complex and chronic health conditions. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and perceptions of nurses participating in a Canadian ECHO programme on concurrent disorders about the competencies they developed and used in their clinical practice, and which factors have influenced this process. Methods The study was qualitative, guided by an interpretive description approach. Individual semi-structured interviews were held with ten nurses who had participated in the programme between 2018 and 2020. A thematic analysis was conducted iteratively using an inductive approach to progressive data coding and organization. Results Four themes and eighteen sub-themes were identified. During their participation in ECHO, the nurses perceived as having further developed eight clinical nursing competencies. Nurses viewed ECHO as a unique opportunity to open themselves to their peers' experiences and reflect on their own knowledge. Learning from experts in the field of concurrent disorders helped them to build their confidence in managing complex clinical situations. The nurses' sense of belonging to a community further enhanced their engagement in the programme, and learning was facilitated through the programme's interprofessional environment. Nevertheless, the lack of contextualized educative content linked to local realities, the limited resources in concurrent disorders, and time constraints were experienced as factors limiting competency development. Conclusions ECHO is a promising alternative to conventional, in-person continuing education programmes to improve the development of advanced competencies among nurses providing care to individuals with chronic and complex health conditions. These findings can inform clinicians, educators, researchers, and decision makers who are developing, implementing, evaluating, and escalating future educational interventions in the field of CDs.",10.1186/s12912-022-00943-w,wos,Nursing,Competencies; Competency development; Continuing education; Co-occurring disorders; Interpretive description; Project ECHO; Virtual communities,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12912-022-00943-w)

We developed an internet-based cognitive behavioral intervention for people with HIV and depressive symptoms, which was based on an effective self-help booklet. The Web-based intervention was previously found to be effective. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate potential mediators of the Web-based intervention. Methods: This study was part of a randomized controlled trial, in which the intervention was compared with an attention-only waiting list control condition. Participants were 188 (97 in intervention group and 91 in control group) people with HIV and mild to moderate depressive symptoms recruited in HIV treatment centers in the Netherlands. A total of 22 participants (22/188, 11.7%) in the study were female and 166 (166/188, 88.3%) were male. The average age of the participants was 46.30 years (SD 10.63). The intervention comprised Web-based self-help CBT for 8 weeks, 1 to 2 hours a week, including minimal telephone support from a coach. The participants received Web-based questionnaires at pretest, 3 times during the intervention/or waiting period, and post intervention. The outcome was depressive symptoms. Factors tested as potential mediators were changes in behavioral activation, relaxation, the cognitive coping strategies catastrophizing and positive refocusing, goal re-engagement, and coping self-efficacy. Results: Using multilevel structural equation modeling, changes in behavioral activation (P=.006) and goal re-engagement (P=.009) were found to be significant mediators of the intervention effect. The mediation effect seemed to occur between weeks 3 and 5 for behavioral activation and weeks 1 and 3 for goal re-engagement. Using (bivariate) autoregressive latent trajectory analysis, we found a return effect (from the dependent variable to the mediator) for goal re-engagement but not for behavioral activation, which suggested that the mediation effect of changes in behavioral activation was stronger than that in goal re-engagement. Conclusions: The results suggest that changes in behavioral activation and goal re-engagement may mediate the effect of the Web-based intervention for people with HIV and depressive symptoms. The results may lead to possible mechanisms of change of the intervention and improvement of therapy outcomes.",10.2196/12711,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,HIV; depression; internet; digital health; digital medicine; cognitive behavioral therapy; coaching; randomized controlled trial; mediators,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/12711)
Exploring a Dance/Movement Program on Mental Health and Well-Being in Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence During a Pandemic,Good,"Ozumerzifon, Y; Ross, A; Brinza, T; Gibney, G; Garber, CE",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2022,"AimsThe aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and benefits of a 12-session dance/movement program for intimate partner violence survivors' mental health and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The specific purposes were fourfold: (1) To determine the feasibility of delivering a virtual dance/movement workshop program; (2) to examine the effects of the program on symptoms of PTSD and psychological distress; (3) to determine whether heart rate variability improves; and (4) to describe the individual and shared experiences of a subgroup of participants of the program. MethodsForty-five women ages 23-48 years were randomized to a 12-session virtual creative dance/movement program or a usual care control group, and completed questionnaires about PTSD and mental health symptoms, general health, physical activity, and underwent a brief measurement of heart rate variability. A subset of the intervention group participated in a semi-structured focus group. ResultsThe results of the study showed that the female survivors of intimate partner violence who participated in the virtual workshops felt better, and they experienced improved affect and reduced tension. They found new ways to express themselves, attune to their bodies, learn new self-care habits, and build community as they engaged in the workshops. Over the course of the study, the participants' symptoms of PTSD and psychological distress lessened. There were no changes in heart rate variability. ConclusionsThis complex study was successfully completed during a global pandemic and resulted in improvements in some mental health symptoms and overall well-being. Given the importance of this work with intimate partner violence survivors, further work exploring dance/movement workshops for participants virtually and in-person is needed.",10.3389/fpsyt.2022.887827,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,intimate partner violence; dance; physical activity; trauma; domestic violence; stress; mental health; PTSD,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.887827)
Exploring association of mobile phone access with positive health outcomes and behaviors amongst post-partum mothers in rural Malawi,Population,"Anto-Ocrah, M; Latulipe, RJ; Mark, TE; Adler, D; Zaihra, T; Lanning, JW",BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH,2022,"Background Access to mass media and emerging technologies (e.g., cell phones, the internet, and social media) is a social determinant of health that has been shown to profoundly influence women's health outcomes. In the African region, where women in rural settings with limited access to care are most vulnerable to maternal mortality and other pregnancy-related morbidities, mobile phone access can be an important and life-saving health determinant. Objective The goal of this study was to examine the association between mobile/cellular phone ownership and health behaviors of post-partum mothers in rural Malawi. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we recruited and consented a convenient sample of 174 post-partum mothers of 4- and 5-month-olds who were attending well-child clinics in Gowa, situated in the rural Ntcheu district of Malawi. Using logistic regression models, we hypothesized that compared to non-cell phone owners, mobile phone ownership will be predictive (greater odds) of antenatal visit frequency, exclusive breastfeeding knowledge and practices, health-seeking behaviors, and involvement in motherhood support groups; and protective (lower odds) of infant illnesses, breastfeeding challenges, and post-partum depressive symptoms. Results Mobile phones were highly prevalent in this rural setting, with 45% (n = 79) of post-partum women indicating they owned at least one cell phone. Cell phone owners tended to have higher levels of education (p < 0.012) and wealth (p < 0.001). Interestingly, mobile phone ownership was only associated with exclusive breastfeeding practices; and phone owners had 75% lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding (adj. OR 0.25; 95% CI: 0.07-0.92, p = 0.038) in multivariable models. Though not statistically significant but clinically meaningful, cell phone ownership was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (adj. OR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.39-1.84, p = 0.67) and more social support (adj. OR 1.14; 95% CI: 0.61-2.13, p = 0.70). Conclusions Digital literacy and internet connectivity are social determinants of health, thus delving deeper into mothers' digital experiences to identify and ameliorate their unique barriers to full digital access will be crucial to successful implementation of digital interventions to address post-partum challenges for women in hard-to-reach settings such as ours. Such interventions are of even greater relevance as the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the urgency of reaching vulnerable, marginalized populations.",10.1186/s12884-022-04782-0,wos,Obstetrics & Gynecology,Malawi; Cell; mobile phone technology; Social determinants of health; Breastfeeding; Africa; Covid; Mhealth; Digital health; Information and communication technology (ICT),URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04782-0)

Menopause is a transition for all women, and; therefore needs recognition as it can impact work performance and consequently staff turnover.Background: Women will go through the menopause, but not all women are affected. The menopause transition presents a range of signs and symptoms both physical and psychological which can impact the quality of life and individuals' work/life balance. The nursing workforce is predominantly women that will work through the menopause transition.Objectives: The study explored perspectives on digital health interventions as strategies to support menopausal women and to understand the requirements for designing health interventions for support in the workplace.Design: A qualitative explorative design.Settings: Nurses working in a range of clinical settings in England, Finland, Denmark, New Zealand, Australia and USA.Methods: Nurses (n = 48) participated in focus groups from six different countries from February 2020-June 2022 during the pandemic from a range of acute, primary care and education settings. Nurses were invited to participate to share their experiences. Thematic analysis was used.Results: All participants were able to describe the physical symptoms of menopause, with some cultural and possible hemisphere differences; more noticeable was the psychological burden of menopause and fatigue that is not always recognized. Four themes were identified: Managing symptoms in the workplace; Recognition in the workplace; Menopause interventions; and Expectation versus the invisible reality. These themes revealed information that can be translated for implementation into digital health interventions.Conclusions: Managers of nursing female staff in the menopausal age range need greater awareness, and menopause education should involve everyone.

"Exploring the Acceptability, Feasibility, and Effectiveness of a Digital Parenting Program to Improve Parental Well-being After the Christchurch Earthquakes: Cluster-Randomized Trial",Population,"Donkin, L; Merry, S; Moor, S; Mowat, A; Hetrick, S; Hopkins, S; Seers, K; Frampton, C; D'Aeth, L",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Up to 6 years after the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes, approximately one-third of parents in the Christchurch region reported difficulties managing the continuously high levels of distress their children were experiencing. In response, an app named Kakano was co-designed with parents to help them better support their children's mental health.Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of Kakano, a mobile parenting app to increase parental confidence in supporting children struggling with their mental health.Methods: A cluster-randomized delayed access controlled trial was carried out in the Christchurch region between July 2019 and January 2020. Parents were recruited through schools and block randomized to receive immediate or delayed access to Kakano. Participants were given access to the Kakano app for 4 weeks and encouraged to use it weekly. Web-based pre-and postintervention measurements were undertaken.Results: A total of 231 participants enrolled in the Kakano trial, with 205 (88.7%) participants completing baseline measures and being randomized (101 in the intervention group and 104 in the delayed access control group). Of these, 41 (20%) provided full outcome data, of which 19 (18.2%) were for delayed access and 21 (20.8%) were for the immediate Kakano intervention. Among those retained in the trial, there was a significant difference in the mean change between groups favoring Kakano in the brief parenting assessment (F1,39=7, P=.012) but not in the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (F1,39=2.9, P=.099), parenting self-efficacy (F1,39=0.1, P=.805), family cohesion (F1,39=0.4, P=.538), or parenting sense of confidence (F1,40=0.6, P=.457). Waitlisted participants who completed the app after the waitlist period showed similar trends for the outcome measures with significant changes in the brief assessment of parenting and the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. No relationship between the level of app usage and outcome was found. Although the app was designed with parents, the low rate of completion of the trial was disappointing.Conclusions: Kakano is an app co-designed with parents to help manage their children's mental health. There was a high rate of attrition, as is often seen in digital health interventions. However, for those who did complete the intervention, there was some indication of improved parental well-being and self-assessed parenting.

Exploring the effect of EFL students' self-made digital stories on their vocabulary learning,Other,"Nami, F; Asadnia, F",SYSTEM,2024,"In spite of the growing interest in digital storytelling (DST) in the English as a foreign language (EFL) context, there is a lacuna in research on the role it plays in learning vocabulary. This sequential explanatory mixed-methods study explored the potential of collaborative learner-generated digital stories (DSs) for vocabulary knowledge development and students' attitudes towards DST-based vocabulary learning experiences. The primary data sources included pre/post-treatment vocabulary tests, collective reflection journals, weblog comments, and interviews. Two experimental groups of undergraduate EFL students were engaged in collaborative DST projects and their vocabulary test scores were compared with those of students in two control groups. The quantitative data were analyzed using independent and paired samples t-tests. Constant comparative method was employed to analyze the qualitative data. As the results showed, the students that were involved in learning the new words through collaborative DSs in the experi-mental groups outperformed the students in the control groups. The findings further demon-strated that DST empowers the students to integrate vocabulary learning into immediate daily contexts, experience peer-promoted vocabulary learning, contextualize vocabulary in multimodal stories, personalize the vocabulary knowledge development process, and enhance cognitive -affective engagement with stories to learn new words. The students also stated that DST is not a stand-alone pedagogical approach and recommended using animated, game-based, immersive, synchronous, social media-based, and micro DSs to facilitate vocabulary learning.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of self-reflective practice on cognitive emotion regulation and resilience of mothers of preterm infants in the NICU. Methods & Materials: A total of 90 mothers whose preterm infants were admitted to NICU enrolled in the current non-randomized clinical trial study by convenience sampling (n=45 in each group). The data of the control group were gathered prior to the intervention group. Pre- and post-test data were gathered using the demographic questionnaire, the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the Conner and Davidson Resilience Scale. Self-reflection practice was designed and conducted based on Gibbs' reflective cycle for the intervention group, which applied a blended model (face-to-face and virtual). Statistical analysis was conducted by SPSS-25 and using the repeated measure ANOVA. Results: Using ANCOVA, the results indicated that the self-reflection practice was effective in improving cognitive emotion regulation (F=66.01, P<0.001, Eta=0.60) and resilience (F=89.43, P<0.001, Eta= 0.67) among mothers in the intervention group.

Exploring the experiences of people and family carers from under-represented groups in self-managing Parkinson's disease and their use of digital health to do this,Other,"Nimmons, D; Armstrong, M; Pigott, J; Walters, K; Schrag, A; Ogunleye, D; Dowridge, W; Read, J; Davies, N",DIGITAL HEALTH,2022,"Introduction Digital health is thought to enable people to better manage chronic conditions, such as Parkinson's. However, little is known about how people from under-represented groups with chronic conditions use digital health to self-manage. Objective The objective of our study was to explore the experiences of people and family carers from under-represented groups in self-managing Parkinson's, including their use of digital health to do this. Methods Semi-structured interviews (n = 18, including four dyadic) were conducted remotely, with 16 people with Parkinson's and six family carers in 2020-2021. Participants were purposively sampled from under-represented groups: belong to an ethnic minority, or having significant physical or sensory impairment. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Results Three main themes of importance were developed: 'self-management support', 'digital health use to support self-management' and 'identity, attitudes and characteristics'. Participants received medical, psychological, social and practical self-management support. Some participants used digital health resources, e.g., Parkinson's UK website. Digital literacy was the biggest barrier to using digital health, regardless of background, often dependant on previous occupation and confidence. Few ethnic minority participants thought race or culture alters self-management ability and most believed there was no need for digital health interventions to be tailored to an individual's race or culture. Some felt inclusivity was important in terms of diverse images of people. A range of considerations were identified to optimise digital health, such as assistive equipment for people with sensory impairment. Conclusions Barriers to using digital health for self-management were primarily dependent on personal factors including digital literacy and attitudes but rarely race or culture. We recommend the optimisation of digital health interventions by providing assistive technology at low cost, and visual inclusiveness should be promoted by including images of people from diverse backgrounds.",10.1177/20552076221102261,wos,"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Informatics",NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1177/20552076221102261)

This study examined whether an app-based just-in-time intervention (ImproveYourMood+) decreased depressive symptoms, and whether the following features were related to symptom improvement: micro-intervention content, mood monitoring, and just-in-time prompts to use content. Methods: Participants (n = 235) from the general population who self-identified as wanting to improve their negative mood were randomised to a waitlist control group (n = 55) or one of three intervention groups: MoodTracker (monitoring-only, n = 58), ImproveYourMood (monitoring and content; n = 62), or ImproveYourMood+ (monitoring, content, and prompts; n = 60). The active intervention phase was 3 weeks. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, and negative automatic thoughts were assessed at baseline, immediately postintervention, and one month following post-intervention. Results: Linear mixed modelling revealed greater declines over time in depressive and anxiety symptoms and negative automatic thoughts for the ImproveYourMood group (standardized mean differences [SMDs] ranged from.32 to.40) and improves for the ImproveYourMood+ group for negative automatic thoughts (SMDs >=.37) compared to the waitlist control group. No between-group differences were observed between the MoodTracker and control groups (SMDs =.04-.23). User experience appeared to be superior in more comprehensive/multimodal versions. Limitations: The study employed a naturalistic design, whereby participants self-selected to utilise the program, did not complete eligibility assessments, and did not receive compensation. The study therefore attained considerable drop-out rate (similar to 50% by the follow-up timepoints), potentially reflecting the usage patterns of real-world mental health apps. Conclusions: The findings suggest that micro-interventions can be an effective way to reduce depressive symptoms both in the moment and 1-2 months later.

Study objectives were to determine whether receiving an information booklet about PCa treatment options prior to receiving biopsy results was acceptable to patients, and if receiving this information influenced levels of anxiety, depression, distress, and treatment decisional conflict. Methods Between June 2016 and September 2017, a randomised block design was used to allocate patients from an Australian urology practice into the intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group were provided with written information about treatment options for localised PCa prior to their biopsy. Outcome measures including the Distress Thermometer, Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Decisional Conflict Scale were completed pre-biopsy and 2-3 weeks post-biopsy. Ninety-eight patients referred for an initial prostate biopsy for an elevated PSA test or suspicious digital rectal exam participated in the study (response rate = 78%).

Sixty participants (M-age = 36.9 years; 63.3% women) diagnosed with social anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to individual virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), individual in vivo exposure therapy (iVET), or waiting-list. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that both treatment groups improved from pre-to postassessment on social anxiety symptoms, speech duration, perceived stress, and avoidant personality disorder related beliefs when compared to the waiting-list. Participants receiving iVET, but not VRET, improved on fear of negative evaluation, speech performance, general anxiety, depression, and quality of life relative to those on waiting-list. The iVET condition was further superior to the VRET condition regarding decreases in social anxiety symptoms at post- and follow-up assessments, and avoidant personality disorder related beliefs at follow-up. At follow-up, all improvements were significant for iVET. For VRET, only the effect for perceived stress was significant. VRET containing extensive verbal interaction without any cognitive components can effectively reduce complaints of generalized social anxiety disorder. Future technological and psychological improvements of virtual social interactions might further enhance the efficacy of VRET for social anxiety disorder. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to three groups. Participants in Condition A (n = 8) took part in an online DIT group, with self-help materials, facilitated by a therapist. Participants in Condition B (n = 8) were given access to a closed virtual group space where they could interact with each other and were supplied with the same self-help materials used by participants in Condition A, but without online therapist facilitation. Participants in Condition C (n = 8) received no instructions or facilitation, but had access to an online mental well-being site where they could meet virtually in a large, open, moderated virtual group space to discuss their psychological difficulties. This feasibility study was underpowered to detect significant differences in rates of change between facilitated and unfacilitated provision of material, but decline in symptoms appeared to be superior to control only for the facilitated group when the groups were considered separately.

Facilitating difficult conversations through art: creating an anti-racism digital image library for health professions education,Not Multi User,"Balhara, KS; Yenawine, P; Irvin, N; Eller, L; Habib, L; Tatham, C; Chisolm, M",INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY,2023,"Racism has been recognised as a threat to patient outcomes, public health, and the healthcare workforce, and health professions (HP) educators and learners alike are seeking effective ways to teach anti-racism in HP education. However, facilitating conversations on race and racism in healthcare contexts can be challenging. Integrative arts and humanities approaches can engage learners in the critical dialogue necessary to educational interventions focused on anti-racism. Discussions of works of visual art, for instance, can leverage visual art as an avenue for indirection to balance introspection and revelation with psychological safety. Structured pedagogical frameworks that emphasise the perspectives and experiences of participants, such as the Visual Thinking Strategies approach, can lead to open-ended and collaborative discussions where participants can safely explore their assumptions in a space that encourages productive discomfort. Visual arts-based programs on anti-racism in HP are limited, though, in part because no collection of images exists to support HP educators in this endeavour.

A descriptive and interpretative study was carried out using the qualitative research paradigm with the use of the analytical technique of discourse analysis, extracting the data through the completion of focus groups. Participants' speech was digitally audio-recorded in digital format. In order to complete the codification of the participants' speech content, we relied on the qualitative data analysis (using the QRS NVivo 10 computer software). Thirty-six participants diagnosed with bipolar disorder took part in our study. In the participants' speech concerning the main barriers to pharmacological treatment, three key topics were identified. Perceived facilitators were summarized in four factors. The main facilitators regarding the use of pharmacological treatment in individuals with BD were the ones related with the perceived need for treatment in the acute phase, the recognition of the illness, the shared clinical decision, and the causal biological attribution in the chronic phase. In terms of perceived barriers, social control was identified in both phases, adverse effects in the acute phase, and the absence of effective treatment in the chronic state.",10.3390/ijerph19137633,wos,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",bipolar disorder; acceptability; adherence; core beliefs; group intervention,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19137633)
Family caregiver support groups: spiritual reflections' impact on stress management,Not Digital,"Damianakis, T; Wilson, K; Marziali, E",AGING & MENTAL HEALTH,2018,"Objectives: Caregiving for people with neurodegenerative disease (e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD); frontotemporal dementia (FTD)) is provided primarily by the family care system. Caregiving is taxing and much of the caregiving research is guided by a stress/adaptation theoretical perspective. Within this theoretical model, the role of spirituality in rendering meaning to the caregiver role remains unexplored. We conducted a qualitative analysis of expressions of spirituality and its meaningfulness during the caregiving journey within the context of an online video conferencing support group intervention program.Methods: Eighteen AD and six FTD caregivers participated in the Caring for Others evidence-based program consisting of 10 weekly virtual online support group sessions facilitated by experienced gerontological social workers.Results: Content analysis of the video-recorded group interactions yielded recurrent themes of caregivers' spiritual reflections and their associations with managing caregiver stress responses.Conclusion: The findings inform professional observations of the importance of spiritual beliefs in understanding how caregivers ascribe both positive and negative meanings to critical life events and their management.",10.1080/13607863.2016.1231169,wos,Geriatrics & Gerontology; Psychiatry,Caregiving; dementia; E-health; meaning making; spirituality,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2016.1231169)
"Family treatment courts and the COVID-19 pandemic: Barriers and facilitators to program implementation, client engagement, and recovery*",Not mental health,"Dagenhardt, DMR; Liu, XY; Richards, J; Mersky, J",JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE USE & ADDICTION TREATMENT,2024,"Introduction: Family Treatment Courts (FTCs) serve child welfare-involved parents with substance use issues who are working toward recovery and reunification with their children. Research has linked FTCs to successful outcomes such as treatment access and completion and family reunification, but there has been less attention to factors that hinder and facilitate program implementation and client engagement. Moreover, little is known about how the shift to virtual services during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted FTC programs and the families they serve. Methods: This study examined interview data gathered from staff in six FTCs located in different regions of the country to investigate the impact of the pandemic on programs and the clients they serve. Interviews conducted with clients from one FTC in the Midwest reinforce the data.Results: FTC programs and professionals adjusted to the pandemic by attempting to replicate face-to-face services in an online environment. Virtual services were vital for sustaining FTCs and mitigating barriers to client engagement during the pandemic. At the same time, FTCs were compelled to navigate new barriers to online program implementation as well as acute challenges that clients faced such as greater isolation and reduced treatment access.Conclusions: We discuss implications from these findings with an eye toward maximizing FTC implementation and impact through the intentional use of both in-person programming and online technology after the pandemic.",10.1016/j.josat.2023.209278,wos,Psychology; Substance Abuse,Family treatment court; Recovery; Virtual programming; Pandemic; Engagement; Service delivery,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.josat.2023.209278)

Focusing on the psychological dimension of this pathology (phobic reaction to walking), we looked at how virtual reality associated with serious games can be used to treat this pathology. Methods: Participants with fear of falling were randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a waiting list. The therapy consisted of 12 weekly sessions of virtual reality exposure therapy associated with serious games. Results: Sixteen participants were included. The mean age of the treatment group was 72 years and that of the control group was 69 years. Participants' scores on the fear of falling measure improved after treatment with virtual reality associated with serious games, leading to a significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: Virtual reality exposure therapy associated with serious games can be used in the treatment of fear of falling. The two techniques are complementary (top-down and bottom-up processes).

Feasibility and Acceptability of a Digital Patient-Reported Outcome Tool in Routine Outpatient Diabetes Care: Mixed Methods Formative Pilot Study,Not mental health,"Skovlund, SE; Troelsen, LH; Noergaard, LM; Pietraszek, A; Jakobsen, PE; Ejskjaer, N",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2021,"Background: Improvements in the digital capabilities of health systems provide new opportunities for the integration of patient-reported outcome (PRO) solutions in routine care, which can facilitate the delivery of person-centered diabetes care. We undertook this study as part of our development of a new digital PRO diabetes questionnaire and clinical dialog support tool for use by people with diabetes and their health care professionals (HCPs) to improve person-centered diabetes care quality and outcomes. Objective: This study evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived benefits and impacts of using a digital PRO diabetes tool, DiaProfil, in routine outpatient diabetes care. Methods: Overall, 12 people with diabetes scheduled for routine medical diabetes visits at the outpatient clinic were recruited. Purposive sampling was used to optimize heterogeneity regarding age, gender, duration, type of diabetes, treatment modality, and disease severity. Participants filled out a PRO diabetes questionnaire 2 to 5 days before their visit. During the visit, HCPs used a digital PRO tool to review PRO data with the person with diabetes for collaborative care planning. Participants completed evaluation forms before and after the visit and were interviewed for 30 to 45 minutes after the visit. HCPs completed the evaluation questionnaires after each visit. All visits were audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis. Data were analyzed using quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods analyses. Results: People with diabetes found the PRO diabetes questionnaire to be relevant, acceptable, and feasible to complete from home. People with diabetes and HCPs found the digital PRO tool to be feasible and acceptable for use during the diabetes visit and would like to continue using it. HCPs were able to use the tool in a person-centered manner, as intended. For several people with diabetes, completion of the questionnaire facilitated positive reflection and better preparation for the visit. The use of the PRO tool primarily improved the quality of the dialog by improving the identification and focus on the issues most important to the person with diabetes. People with diabetes did not report any negative aspects of the PRO tool, whereas HCPs highlighted that it was demanding when the person with diabetes had many PRO issues that required attention within the predefined time allocated for a visit. Conclusions: The Danish PRO diabetes questionnaire and the digital tool, DiaProfil, are feasible and acceptable solutions for routine diabetes visits, and this tool may generate important benefits related to advancement of person-centered care. Further research is now required to corroborate and expand these formative insights on a larger scale and in diverse health care settings.

Feasibility and Acceptability of a Web-Based Treatment with Telephone Support for Postpartum Women With Anxiety: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Ashford, MT; Olander, EK; Rowe, H; Fisher, JRW; Ayers, S",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2018,"Background: Postpartum anxiety can have adverse effects on the mother and child if left untreated. Time constraints and stigma are common barriers to postpartum treatment. Web-based treatments offer potential flexibility and anonymity. What Am I Worried About (WaWa) is a self-guided treatment based on cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness principles for women experiencing postpartum anxiety. WaWa was developed in Australia and consists of 9 modules with optional weekly telephone support. WaWa was adapted to a Web-based version for use in England (Internet-based What Am I Worried About, iWaWa). Objective: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility (engagement and usability) and acceptability (usefulness, satisfaction, and helpfulness) of iWaWa among English postpartum women with anxiety. Methods: Postpartum (<12 months) women with mild-to-severe anxiety were recruited anonymously via social media during an 8-week period. Participants were randomized to the iWaWa treatment (8 weeks) or wait-list control group. Treatment and study feasibility and acceptability were assessed after the treatment, and anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks postrandomization, and 12 weeks postrandomization (treatment group only) using Web-based questionnaires. Semistructured telephone interviews were carried out after the treatment period for a more in-depth exploration of treatment acceptability and feasibility. Results: A total of 89 eligible women were recruited through social media and randomized into the treatment (n=46) or wait-list control group (n=43). Women were predominantly Caucasian, well-educated, married, on maternity leave, first-time mothers and reported moderate levels of anxiety. Dropout rates were high, especially in the treatment group (treatment: 82%, 38/46; wait-list control: 51%, 22/43). A total of 26 women started iWaWa with only 2 women completing all 9 modules. Quantitative and qualitative data suggest iWaWa was experienced as generally useful and helpful. Participants enjoyed iWaWa's accessibility, anonymity, and weekly reminders, as well as the introduction to the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness. However, iWaWa was also experienced as not user-friendly enough, too long, and not smartphone-friendly. Parts of the content were experienced as not always relevant and appropriate. Participants felt that iWaWa could be improved by having it in a smartphone app format and by making the content more concise and inclusive of different parenting styles. Conclusions: Despite interest in iWaWa, the results suggest that both the study and iWaWa were not feasible in the current format. However, this first trial provides useful evidence about treatment format and content preferences that can inform iWaWa's future development, as well as research and development of Web-based postpartum anxiety treatments, in general, to optimize adherence.",10.2196/mental.9106,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,anxiety; mental health; postpartum period; treatment; Internet; randomized controlled trial,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/mental.9106)
Feasibility and Effectiveness of Assessing Subhealth Using a Mobile Health Management App (MibyeongBogam) in Early Middle-Aged Koreans: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Baek, Y; Jeong, K; Lee, S; Kim, H; Seo, BN; Jin, HJ",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2021,"Background: Mobile health (mHealth) is a major source of health management systems. Moreover, the demand for mHealth, which is in need of change due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is increasing worldwide. Accordingly, interest in health care in everyday life and the importance of mHealth are growing. Objective: We developed the MibyeongBogam (MBBG) app that evaluates the user's subhealth status via a smartphone and provides a health management method based on that user's subhealth status for use in everyday life. Subhealth is defined as a state in which the capacity to recover to a healthy state is diminished, but without the presence of clinical disease. The objective of this study was to compare the awareness and status of subhealth after the use of the MBBG app between intervention and control groups, and to evaluate the app's practicality. Methods: This study was a prospective, open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted at two hospitals in Korea with 150 healthy people in their 30s and 40s, at a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants visited the hospital three times as follows: preintervention, intermediate visit 6 weeks after the intervention, and final visit 12 weeks after the intervention. Key endpoints were measured at the first visit before the intervention and at 12 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcome was the awareness of subhealth, and the secondary outcomes were subhealth status, health-promoting behaviors, and motivation to engage in healthy behaviors. Results: The primary outcome, subhealth awareness, tended to slightly increase for both groups after the uncompensated intervention, but there was no significant difference in the score between the two groups (intervention group: mean 23.69, SD 0.25 vs control group: mean 23.1, SD 0.25; P=.09). In the case of secondary outcomes, only some variables of the subhealth status showed significant differences between the two groups after the intervention, and the intervention group showed an improvement in the total scores of subhealth (P=.03), sleep disturbance (P=.02), depression (P=.003), anger (P=.01), and anxiety symptoms (P=.009) compared with the control group. Conclusions: In this study, the MBBG app showed potential for improving the health, especially with regard to sleep disturbance and depression, of individuals without particular health problems. However, the effects of the app on subhealth awareness and health-promoting behaviors were not clearly evaluated. Therefore, further studies to assess improvements in health after the use of personalized health management programs provided by the MBBG app are needed. The MBBG app may be useful for members of the general public, who are not diagnosed with a disease but are unable to lead an optimal daily life due to discomfort, to seek strategies that can improve their health.

The platform combines standard serious games and cognitive stimulation leveraging virtual and augmented reality technologies. A double-arm, evaluator-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted with 21 elderly participants in the MCI spectrum, with 11 in the intervention group (INT) and 10 in the control group (CTL). Feasibility was assessed in terms of adherence, effective learning, and perceived usefulness. The INT attended 24 training sessions, 60 minutes long, twice a week, whereas the CTL engaged in normal daily activities and usual care. Results showed that the INT had a statistically significant change in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, stages List B Recall, Short-term delayed Recall, and Long-term delayed Recall of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Trail Making Test-A and B test scores, Digit Span Test (DST) Forward Span, and Functional Activities Questionnaire score. A trend level difference was also found for the RAVLT Recognition and the DST Backward Span. No significant differences were found for the CTL in any of the metrics. The completion rate of the INT was 91%, and the attendance rate was 100% for participants who completed the follow-up segment of the study. The engagement level was high, and effective learning was observed between the participants. The perceived usability and usefulness of the game platform was assessed as high.

Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a digital mental health platform for the workplace, which incorporates evidence-based practices such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. A total of 3 brief, unguided interventions designed to address stress, anxiety, and resilience, respectively, are evaluated. The primary aim is to determine the feasibility of the study methods and interventions in preparation for a definitive randomized controlled trial. Methods: The study used a fully remote, parallel, multi-arm, external pilot randomized controlled trial, with 3 intervention arms and a no-intervention control group. Participants were working adults representative of the general UK population with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity who were recruited from a web-based participant platform. Primary outcomes included objective and self-report measures of feasibility, acceptability, engagement, transferability, relevance, and negative effects. Secondary outcomes included 4 self-report measures of mental health and well-being, completed at baseline (time point 0 [t0]), postintervention (time point 1 [t1]), and the 1-month follow-up (time point 2 [t2]).

Feasibility and preliminary efficacy of perioperative interventions in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting: the randomized controlled I-COPE trial,Not Multi User,"Sadlonova, M; Nagel, J; Becker, S; Neumann, S; Staab, J; Meyer, T; Celano, CM; Amonoo, HL; Fangauf, SV; Herrmann-Lingen, C; Kutschka, I; Friedrich, M",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY,2022,"OBJECTIVES: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are exposed to multiple treatment-related stressors, which can impact coping and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The objective of this trial was to analyse the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a multi-component intervention that combines psychological support and reduction of hospital-specific stressors on HRQoL, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, self-efficacy, and plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and -8 levels in CABG patients. METHODS: This three-arm, randomized controlled, single-centre pilot trial assessed the Intervention for CABG to Optimize Patient Experience in 88 patients undergoing elective CABG. Standard medical care (SMC, n = 29) was compared with 2 intervention groups: (i) psychological interventions to optimize treatment expectations (IA group, n = 30) and (ii) multi-component intervention (IB group, n = 29) with psychological interventions plus an additional treatment package (light therapy, noise reduction, music, and if desired, 360 degrees images delivered via virtual reality). RESULTS: The implementation of psychological interventions in routine medical treatment was feasible (91.5% of participants completed all intervention sessions). Both interventions were associated with significantly shorter hospital stay compared to SMC (IA/IB 9.8/9.3 days vs SMC 12.5 days). Self-efficacy expectations at post-surgery were significantly higher compared to SMC both in the IA group (P = 0.011) and marginally in the IB group (P = 0.051). However, there were no treatment effects of the interventions on HRQoL and plasma levels of IL-6 or IL-8 after CABG.

Feasibility and user-experience of a virtual environment for social connection and education after stroke: A pilot study,Good,"Beauchamp, JES; Wang, MX; Novelo, LGL; Cox, C; Meyer, T; Fagundes, C; Savitz, SI; Sharrief, A; Dishman, D; Johnson, C",JOURNAL OF STROKE & CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES,2024,"Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility and usability of stroke survivor participation in an 8-week virtual environment intervention that provides opportunities for social support exchanges, social network interactions, and recovery education. Materials and methods: A single-group, pre- and post-test measure design was used. Descriptive statistics were used to examine enrollment and retention rates, proportion of questionnaires completed, and virtual environment process data (e.g., number of log-ins) and usability scores. Changes in pre- and post-intervention questionnaire (e.g., usability, social support, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and self-efficacy) scores were explored using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and paired t-test. Results: Fifteen (65 %) of the eligible stroke survivors enrolled (60 % white, 27 % black), 12 (80 %) had an ischemic stroke, ages ranged from 33 to 74 years (mean 44 years), and mean months since stroke was 33 +/- 23. Retention and questionnaire completion rates were both 93 % (n = 14). Survivors logged into the virtual environment a total of 122 times, logged an average of 49 min/log-in, and 12 (80 %) attended support groups and social activities. Median usability score indicated lower than average usability. Improvement trends in social support, loneliness, and depressive symptoms were found, but significant changes in mean questionnaire scores were not found. Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that using a virtual environment to foster social support exchanges, social network interactions, and recovery education after stroke is feasible. Similar to other chronic disease populations, stroke survivor adoption of a virtual environment likely requires ongoing technical assistance, repetition of instructions, and opportunities for practice to reinforce engagement.

Unlike other mutual support groups for addiction, trained facilitators lead all Self-Management and Recovery Training (SMART Recovery) groups, thereby providing an opportunity to implement ROM as a routine component of SMART Recovery groups. Objective: This study protocol aims to describe a stage 1 pilot study designed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, purpose-built mobile health (mHealth) ROM and feedback app (Smart Track) in SMART Recovery groups coordinated by SMART Recovery Australia (SRAU) The secondary objectives are to describe Smart Track usage patterns, explore psychometric properties of the ROM items (ie, internal reliability and convergent and divergent validity), and provide preliminary evidence for participant reported outcomes (such as alcohol and other drug use, self-reported recovery, and mental health). Methods: Participants (n=100) from the SMART Recovery groups across New South Wales, Australia, will be recruited to a nonrandomized, prospective, single-arm trial of the Smart Track app. There are 4 modes of data collection: (1) ROM data collected from group participants via the Smart Track app, (2) data analytics summarizing user interactions with Smart Track, (3) quantitative interview and survey data of group participants (baseline, 2-week follow-up, and 2-month follow-up), and (4) qualitative interviews with group participants (n=20) and facilitators (n=10).

Routine outcome monitoring (ROM) and feedback are yet to be implemented in these settings. SMART Recovery mutual support groups focus on self-empowerment and use evidence-based techniques (eg, motivational and behavioral strategies). Trained facilitators lead all SMART Recovery groups, providing an opportunity to implement ROM. Objective: The aim of this stage 1 pilot study is to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a novel, purpose-built mobile health ROM and feedback app (SMART Track) in mutual support groups coordinated by SMART Recovery Australia (SRAU) over 8 weeks. Methods: SMART Track was developed during phase 1 of this study using participatory design methods and an iterative development process. During phase 2, 72 SRAU group participants were recruited to a nonrandomized, prospective, single-arm trial of the SMART Track app. Four modes of data collection were used: ROM data directly entered by participants into the app; app data analytics captured by Amplitude Analytics (number of visits, number of unique users, visit duration, time of visit, and user retention); baseline, 2-, and 8-week follow-up assessments conducted through telephone; and qualitative telephone interviews with a convenience sample of study participants (20/72, 28%) and facilitators (n=8). Results: Of the 72 study participants, 68 (94%) created a SMART Track account, 64 (88%) used SMART Track at least once, and 42 (58%) used the app for more than 5 weeks. During week 1, 83% (60/72) of participants entered ROM data for one or more outcomes, decreasing to 31% (22/72) by the end of 8 weeks. The two main screens designed to provide personal feedback data (Urges screen and Overall Progress screen) were the most frequently visited sections of the app. Qualitative feedback from participants and facilitators supported the acceptability of SMART Track and the need for improved integration into the SRAU groups. Participants reported significant reductions between the baseline and 8- week scores on the Severity of Dependence Scale (mean difference 1.93, SD 3.02; 95% CI 1.12-2.73) and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-10 (mean difference 3.96, SD 8.31; 95% CI 1.75-6.17), but no change on the Substance Use Recovery Evaluator (mean difference 0.11, SD 7.97; 95% CI -2.02 to 2.24) was reported. Conclusions: Findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of SMART Track. Given that sustained engagement with mobile health apps is notoriously difficult to achieve, our findings are promising.

Feasibility of a Virtual Group-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention for Adolescents With Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction,Good,"Carmody, JK; Kramer, RL; Distel, LML; Davidson, RD; Snyder, JM; Villa, M; Nemec, GE; Hale, AE",CLINICAL PRACTICE IN PEDIATRIC PSYCHOLOGY,2023,"Objective: Psychological intervention is an essential treatment component of disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs), but engagement in evidence-based intervention is far from routine. A group-based treatment delivered via telehealth may expand access to evidence-based care for adolescents with DGBIs. The current study describes the development and initial feasibility and acceptability of the Gastroenterology psychology skills for adolescents (GPS-A), a five-session cognitive behavioral group intervention that teaches adolescents evidence-based skills to manage a range of DGBI symptoms. Method: Participants were 33 adolescents with a range of DGBI diagnoses who completed the intervention group and provided quantitative and qualitative feedback. Participant-reported outcomes (somatic symptoms, functional disability, quality of life [QoL]) were collected pre- and postintervention and at 1-month follow-up. Results: Fifty-one percent of patients contacted (30% of all potentially eligible patients) agreed to participate in the group intervention. Retention was high, with 100% of participants completing five sessions. Participants identified skills, community and interpersonal connections, and validation of their gastrointestinal condition and experience as the most helpful intervention components. There was a significant positive difference in overall and emotional QoL from preintervention to 1-month follow-up, though no significant differences were found in somatic symptoms or functional disability. Conclusions: Unlike previously developed cognitive behavioral therapy interventions, GPS-A was both specific to patients with DGBI symptoms and flexible enough to incorporate a range of disorders (e.g., Irritable Bowel Syndrome, functional dyspepsia, and functional abdominal pain). Future directions include testing preliminary effectiveness in a larger sample and expanding diversity of the sample (gender, race/ethnicity).",10.1037/cpp0000501,wos,Psychology,disorders of gut-brain interaction; adolescent; cognitive behavioral therapy; acceptance and commitment therapy; group intervention,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1037/cpp0000501)
Feasibility of a virtual reality-based approach to improve behavioral weight management outcomes,Not Multi User,"Phelan, S; Peruvemba, S; Levinson, D; Stulberg, N; Lacy, A; Legato, M; Werner, JP",PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES,2021,"Background: Behavioral weight loss interventions promote clinically significant weight loss over 12 months, but weight regain remains problematic and a substantial proportion of participants do not achieve long-term weight loss maintenance. Novel methods are needed that instill habit strength for sustaining weight control behaviors long term. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to provide opportunities within behavioral treatment for patients to practice desired weight control behaviors in the frequency and magnitude necessary to build durable habits. A pilot randomized trial was done to test the feasibility integrating virtual reality (VR) into standard behavioral weight loss treatment. Methods: Participants were 15 adults (43 years; 46.7% Hispanic), with overweight or obesity who were randomly assigned to a 4-week Standard Behavioral Weight Loss plus Non-Weight-Related VR app (i.e., Control Group) or Standard Behavioral Weight Loss plus Weight-Related VR app (i.e., Intervention Group). The Intervention's VR tool was designed to enable practice of behavioral skills taught in weekly group meetings, including managing social and home environmental cues for eating and activity. Results: Participants were recruited over 3 months, and retention at the final assessment visit was high (86.6%). The VR footage and resulting app were rated as highly realistic (6.7 on a 10-point scale), and the VR program overall was rated as highly satisfactory (3.6 on a 4-point scale). Adverse effects of eye strain and motion sickness were minimal (similar to 2 on a 7-point scale). As expected, the intervention and control groups both lost weight and unadjusted means (SD) averaged 3.4% (2.7) and 2.3% (3.6), respectively, over the 4 weeks. Overall, participants reported preferring a VR approach above traditional weight loss programs (rating of 5 on a 7-point scale). Conclusions: Future research is needed to develop and test the feasibility of using VR for other weight control skills with a larger sample size and longer evaluation period to determine if VR can improve standard behavioral weight loss outcomes by intensifying practice opportunities and building habit strength for weight loss maintenance.",10.1186/s40814-021-00865-5,wos,Research & Experimental Medicine,Virtual reality; Weight loss; Obesity; Lifestyle intervention; Behavioral treatment,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40814-021-00865-5)
Feasibility of early digital health rehabilitation after cardiac surgery in the elderly: a qualitative study,Other,"Toft, BS; Rodkjaer, LO; Sorensen, L; Saugbjerg, MR; Bekker, HL; Modrau, IS",BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,2024,"BackgroundIncreasing numbers of elderly patients experience prolonged decreased functional capacity and impaired quality of life after seemingly successful cardiac surgery. After discharge from hospital, these patients experience a substantial gap in care until centre-based cardiac rehabilitation commences. They may benefit from immediate coaching by means of mobile health technology to overcome psychological and physiological barriers to physical activity. The aim of this study was to explore the usability, acceptability, and relevance of a mobile health application designed to support remote exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation of elderly patients early after cardiac surgery from the perspective of patients, their relatives, and physiotherapists.MethodsWe adapted a home-based mobile health application for use by elderly patients early after cardiac surgery. Semi-structured dyadic interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of patients (n = 9), their spouses (n = 5), and physiotherapists (n = 2) following two weeks of the intervention. The transcribed interviews were analysed thematically.ResultsThree themes were identified: 1) creating an individual fit by tailoring the intervention; 2) prioritizing communication and collaboration; and 3) interacting with the mobile health application. Overall, the findings indicate that the mobile health intervention has the potential to promote engagement, responsibility, and motivation among elderly patients to exercise early after surgery. However, the intervention can also be a burden on patients and their relatives when roles and responsibilities are unclear.ConclusionThe mobile health intervention showed potential to bridge the intervention gap after cardiac surgery, as well as in fostering engagement, responsibility, and motivation for physical activity among elderly individuals. Nevertheless, our findings emphasize the necessity of tailoring the intervention to accommodate individual vulnerabilities and capabilities. The intervention may be improved by addressing a number of organizational and communicational issues. Adaptions should be made according to the barriers and facilitators identified in this study prior to testing the effectiveness of the intervention on a larger scale.

However, no virtual reality pain therapy software existed that met the needs of cancer patients with neuropathic pain. We created a bespoke virtual reality-delivered pain therapy software programme to help cancer patients manage neuropathic pain incorporating guided visualisation and progressive muscle relaxation techniques, whilst minimising the risk of cybersickness in this vulnerable patient population. This randomised controlled pilot study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, recruitment rates and risk of cybersickness of this pain therapy software programme. Clinical outcomes including opioid consumption, pain severity, pain interference and global quality of life scores were secondary aims. Of 87 eligible cancer patients with neuropathic pain, 39 were recruited (47%), allocated to either the intervention (20 patients, virtual reality pain therapy software programme) or control (19 patients, viewing virtual reality videos). Four patients withdrew before the 3-month follow-up (all in the control group). Pre-existing dizziness (Spearman rho 0.37, p = 0.02) and pre-existing nausea (Spearman rho 0.81, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with risk of cybersickness in both groups. Patients in the intervention group reported less cybersickness, as well as tolerated and completed all therapy sessions. At 1- and 3-month follow-up, there were trends in the intervention group towards reductions in: oral morphine equivalent daily dose opioid consumption (-8 mg and -4 mg; vs. control: 0 mg and +15 mg respectively); modified Brief Pain Inventory pain severity (-0.4, -0.8; vs. control +0.4, -0.3); and pain interference (-0.9, -1.8; vs. control -0.2, -0.3) scores. The global quality of life subscale from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 was not significantly changed between groups at 1 and 3 months (intervention: -5, -8; vs. control: +3, +4). This newly created virtual reality-delivered pain therapy software programme was shown to be feasible and acceptable to cancer patients with neuropathic pain.

"Feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of web-based and mobile PTSD Coach: a systematic review and meta-analysis",Good,"Bröcker, E; Suliman, S; Olff, M; Seedat, S",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY,2023,"Background: Timely and effective interventions can alleviate or prevent the development of clinical symptomatology in trauma-exposed individuals. However, due to limited access to these interventions, and/or stigma around accessing mental health services, there is an unmet need. Internet-and mobile-based interventions may help to address this need. Aims: This review aims to (i) synthesise the evidence on feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the 'PTSD Coach' intervention (both web-based and mobile applications) in trauma-exposed individuals; (ii) evaluate the quality of this research; and (iii) identify challenges and recommendations related to 'PTSD Coach' intervention delivery. Method: Systematic database searches were conducted (PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, PLoS, Web of Science, PTSDpubs, Scopus, and clinical trial databases). Review inclusion was based on predefined inclusion criteria, and study quality was assessed with the mixed methods appraisal and the risk-of-bias tools for randomised trials. Where feasible, meta-analytical pooling of intervention effects on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was conducted. Results: Seventeen manuscripts reporting on 16 primary studies were included with the majority evaluating a self-managed PTSD Coach mobile application intervention. Most studies were conducted in higher-income countries and females were over-represented. For both platforms, satisfaction and perceived helpfulness were generally high but type of smart device operating system was identified as an influence. The pooled effect size in symptom severity in the intervention group compared to the comparison group was not significant (standardised mean difference = - 0.19) (95% CI - 0.41 to - 0.03, p = .09). Heterogeneity was not significant (p = .14; I2 = 40%). No study was excluded based on quality assessment. Conclusion: Findings support the feasibility and acceptability of 'PTSD Coach' in trauma-exposed individuals. However, evidence on the effectiveness on PTSS remains limited.

At Macquarie University's Anxiety Research Unit we have developed Cool Teens, a computer-based, self-help program for this audience. The aim of this study was to examine adolescents' presentation ratings, multimedia preferences, and attitudes to a prototype version of the Cool Teens CD-ROM. Nine adolescents who had previously been treated for an anxiety disorder and 13 non-clinical teens used the prototype and completed a feedback questionnaire. Participants rated all multimedia components positively, but showed a preference for live video in some sections. They reported the CD-ROM was easy to use and visually appealing. The adolescents who had previously been through group treatment all reported they would use a program such as Cool Teens either to prepare or to practice following group sessions. Three of these nine participants reported a preference to use a CD-ROM instead of attending group therapy.

Telepsychological services such as app-based interventions have been proposed as viable alternatives; however, research on their effectiveness is insufficient. This study tested the effectiveness of an app-based intervention for college students on comprehensive indicators of mental health (depression, anxiety, stress, positive affect, and satisfaction with life) in a real-world setting. A total of 352 Korean undergraduates were initially enrolled and randomly allocated to either an intervention (four-week app-based intervention) or control (waitlist) group. Finally, the data of 185 students (intervention group, n = 91; control group, n = 94) were analyzed (attrition rate, 43%). The intervention group demonstrated improved mental health for all outcomes compared with the control group. When symptom severity was considered, participants with moderate-severe depression or anxiety symptoms at baseline displayed a greater reduction in symptoms than participants with mild symptoms.

Finding kindness: A randomized controlled trial of an online self-compassion intervention for weight management (SC4WM),Not Multi User,"Brenton-Peters, JM; Consedine, NS; Cavadino, A; Roy, R; Ginsberg, KH; Serlachius, A",BRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY,2024,"Introduction: Weight loss is hard to achieve and even harder to maintain. Engaging in effortful behavioural change to manage body weight can sometimes result in feelings of guilt and shame. Self-compassion, the tendency to find kindness for oneself in times of struggle, may facilitate coping with the unique challenges of weight management. This study assessed whether a remotely delivered self-compassion intervention improved weight management outcomes when delivered as a supplement to an existing digital behavioural weight management programme, Weight Watchers (WW). Method: Using a mixed-method study design, 249 adults seeking to manage weight were randomized to either the WW programme or WW supplemented with the self-compassion for weight management intervention (SC4WM). Participants completed measures of self-compassion, eating behaviour, physical activity, body weight and emotional well-being along with potential moderators, including weight self- stigma, eating restraint, psychological coping and perceived stress at baseline, post-intervention (4 weeks) and follow-up (12 weeks). Results: There was no evidence that the SC4WM intervention had a significantly different effect than WW alone. Other than body weight, all outcomes improved over time in both groups. Self-compassion was slightly higher overall in the SC4WM group (p =.05), with this group reporting higher self-kindness at 4 weeks (p =.014) and lower self-judgement at 12 weeks (p =.023) compared to the control group. Conclusions: Although the SC4WM intervention group did show a small increase in self-kindness and reduction in self-judgement, weight management outcomes were not improved over and above the existing WW programme.

Fostering resilience and well-being in emerging adults with adverse childhood experiences: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the FACE self-help app,Not Multi User,"Brodbeck, J; Boetschi, SIR; Vetsch, N; Stallmann, L; Loechner, J; Berger, T; Schmidt, SJ; Marmet, S",BMC PSYCHOLOGY,2024,"BackgroundAdverse childhood experiences (ACE) are linked to an increased risk of psychological disorders and lower psychosocial functioning throughout life. This study aims to evaluate the FACE self-help app, designed to promote resilience and well-being in emerging adults with a history of ACE. The app is based on cognitive-behavioural principles and consists of two thematic components: (1) self- and emotion regulation (SER) and (2) social skills and biases in social information processing (SSIP).MethodsThe efficacy of the app will be tested through a single-centre, two-arm randomized controlled trial, comparing an active intervention group against a waiting list control group. The active group is divided into two subgroups, in which the two components are delivered in a different order to investigate differential effects in a crossover design. Up to 250 emerging adults aged 18 to 25 years with a history of ACE from a general population cohort study will be recruited. The primary objective is to test the efficacy of the app in improving resilience (primary outcome) and well-being (co-primary outcome) compared to a waiting list control group and to examine the stability of these effects. The secondary objectives include testing the efficacy of the app in improving the secondary outcomes, i.e., self-efficacy in managing emotions, problem solving, fear of evaluation, social avoidance, and self-esteem; examining the differential effects of the two components; and assessing the effect of the app on real-life data on resilience, affective states, distress in social interactions and coping strategies. Furthermore, the study will investigate potential moderators (e.g. ACE severity) and mediators of intervention outcomes (e.g. self-efficacy in managing emotions).DiscussionThe results will provide insights into the efficacy of the self-help intervention as well as mediators and moderators of outcomes. Furthermore, results will extend the existing knowledge by testing the differential effects of the SER and SSIP component on the outcomes.

Framing Mental Health Within Digital Games: An Exploratory Case Study of Hellblade,Other,"Fordham, J; Ball, C",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2019,"Background: Researchers and therapists have increasingly turned to digital games for new forms of treatments and interventions for people suffering from a variety of mental health issues. Yet, the depiction of mental illness within digital games typically promotes stigmatized versions of those with mental health concerns. Recently, more games have attempted to implement more realistic and respectful depictions of mental health conditions. Objective: This paper presents an exploratory analysis of a contemporary game that has the potential to change the way researchers, practitioners, and game designers approach topics of mental health within the context of gaming. Methods: A case study of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice was conducted using frame analysis to show how key design choices for this game present the potential for new ways of approaching games and mental health. Results: A case study of Hellblade's development shows how research-informed collaborative design with mental health practitioners, scientists, and individuals with mental health problems can lead to a realistic depiction of mental illness in games. Furthermore, the use of frame analysis demonstrates how to harness narrative, mechanics, and technology to create embodied experiences of mental health, which has the potential to promote empathetic understanding. Conclusions: This paper highlights an exemplary case of collaborative commercial game design for entertainment purposes in relation to mental health. Understanding the success of Hellblade's depiction of psychosis can improve serious games research and design. Further research must continue to provide deeper analysis of not only games that depict mental illness, but also the design process behind them.",10.2196/12432,wos,Psychiatry,video games; electronic gaming; psychosis; stigma,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/12432)
From the identification of biopsychosocial risk factors to an increase in pain-related self-efficacy (IDRIS)-The online-based conveyance of an explanatory model for chronic back pain: Study protocol of a cohort multiple randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Engelmann, P; Löwe, B; Hüsing, P",INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH,2022,"Background: Back pain has a high global prevalence and carries a substantial risk for chronification. Biopsychosocial factors are assumed to be critical in the transition from acute to chronic back pain. Digital interventions are a promising tool to educate patients about their complaints. Thus, providing patients with an explanatory model regarding their individual risk factors in the early stage of their complaints via the internet might thus be a valuable approach in treatment. Objectives: The objectives of the present online study are to investigate the influence of a personalized psychoeducational intervention on self-efficacy and functioning and to examine biopsychosocial risk factors for symptom chronification. The intervention is based on a current model summarizing the empirical knowledge on relevant factors for persistent somatic symptoms, which has not been studied in back pain patients yet. Methods: An observational cohort of patients with acute and subacute back pain (N = 564) will be asked about biopsychosocial risk factors via online survey at baseline, 4-week, and 12-week follow-up. Within this cohort, a randomly selected group of 132 participants (intervention group) with psychological burden (MCS-12 score of the SF-12 <= 50) and relevant somatic symptom intensity and interference (mean sum score of two numeric rating scales >= 5) and no prior psychotherapeutic treatment will be offered a personalized explanatory model in the form of an animated psychoeducational video. The video will be personalized in terms of participants' individual symptom profile and will be made accessible to watch online for 7 days. Participants will be compared to a control group receiving no treatment regarding change in pain-specific self-efficacy after 1 month as primary outcome, and change in functioning after 1 and 3 months, respectively, as secondary outcomes. Acceptance and usefulness of the intervention will be evaluated using the number of video views and a numeric rating scale. Discussion: This is the first investigation of a personalized, video-animated online psychoeducation based on patients' individual risk factors for the chronification of back pain and the first systematic evaluation of the risk factors included in a comprehensive aetiological model on persistent somatic symptoms in back pain patients. This way, this study contributes to the understanding of cross-disorder psychopathological factors and a stronger consideration of biopsychosocial factors in the treatment of persistent somatic symptoms. If proven effective, the internet-based intervention will make an important contribution to the early treatment of back pain.

Future Patient Telerehabilitation for Patients With Heart Failure: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Dinesen, B; Dittmann, L; Gade, JD; Jorgensen, CK; Hollingdal, M; Leth, S; Melholt, C; Spindler, H; Refsgaard, J",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2019,"Background: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for 13%-15% of all deaths. Cardiac rehabilitation has poor compliance and adherence. Telerehabilitation has been introduced to increase patients' participation, access, and adherence with the help of digital technologies. The target group is patients with heart failure. A telerehabilitation program called Future Patient has been developed and consists of three phases: (1) titration of medicine (0-3 months), (2) implementation of the telerehabilitation protocols (3 months), and (3) follow-up with rehabilitation in everyday life (6 months). Patients in the Future Patient program measure their blood pressure, pulse, weight, number of steps taken, sleep, and respiration and answer questions online regarding their well-being. All data are transmitted and accessed in the HeartPortal by patients and health care professionals. Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe the research design, outcome measures, and data collection techniques in the clinical test of the Future Patient Telerehabilitation Program for patients with heart failure. Methods: A randomized controlled study will be performed. The intervention group will follow the Future Patient Telerehabilitation program, and the control group will follow the traditional cardiac rehabilitation program. The primary outcome is quality of life measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are development of clinical data; illness perception; motivation; anxiety and depression; health and electronic health literacy; qualitative exploration of patients', spouses', and health care professionals' experiences of participating in the telerehabilitation program; and a health economy evaluation of the program.

GLUCOCORTICOIDS ENHANCE IN VIVO EXPOSURE- BASED THERAPY OF SPIDER PHOBIA,Other,"Soravia, LM; Heinrichs, M; Winzeler, L; Fisler, M; Schmitt, W; Horn, H; Dierks, T; Strik, W; Hofmann, SG; de Quervain, DJF",DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY,2014,"BackgroundPreclinical and clinical studies indicate that the administration of glucocorticoids may promote fear extinction processes. In particular, it has been shown that glucocorticoids enhance virtual reality based exposure therapy of fear of heights. Here, we investigate whether glucocorticoids enhance the outcome of in vivo exposure-based group therapy of spider phobia. MethodsIn a double blind, block-randomized, placebo-controlled, between-subject study design, 22 patients with specific phobia of spiders were treated with two sessions of in vivo exposure-based group therapy. Cortisol (20 mg) or placebo was orally administered 1 hr before each therapy session. Patients returned for a follow-up assessment one month after therapy. ResultsExposure-based group therapy led to a significant decrease in phobic symptoms as assessed with the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) from pretreatment to immediate posttreatment and to follow-up. The administration of cortisol to exposure therapy resulted in increased salivary cortisol concentrations and a significantly greater reduction in fear of spiders (FSQ) as compared to placebo at follow-up, but not immediately posttreatment. Furthermore, cortisol-treated patients reported significantly less anxiety during standardized exposure to living spiders at follow-up than placebo-treated subjects. Notably, groups did not differ in phobia-unrelated state-anxiety before and after the exposure sessions and at follow-up.

"General Practice and the Community: Research on health service, quality improvements and training. Selected abstracts from the EGPRN Meeting in Vigo, Spain, 17-20 October 2019 Abstracts",Other,[Anonymous],EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE,2020,"Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64 years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations. Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150 minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant. Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6% were women. No significant differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5 points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic. Background: Tourism represents 45% gross domestic product in Balearic Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication, poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10 semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study (DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS: 1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7 years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7). HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2% (IC 95% 65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9% (IC 95% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands; 55.3% (IC 95% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6% and 35.1% self-reported regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker than women from the same social class do. Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51%), repetitive and having a severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost. Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection. Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge, improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least 20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months. In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults: Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There was a 63.5% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion: Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV in primary care. Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented. Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results: First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000 unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population. Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics, drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge. Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort included 561 patients, women were 56%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03) years and 31.5% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were 54%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV, saturation of oxygen lower than 90% or an increase in the dyspnoea at the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart failure decompensation. Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial: qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district (Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data. Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31 CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention (intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished (adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate, compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and 11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We identified the constructs that explain the variation in the effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services. Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut), Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes: Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5%) were lost to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was -3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to reduce BZD prescription in primary care. Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP) frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP, proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of 2733 (11%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7% for 14 intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED. Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93%, in 6% of the cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention. More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll. Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical, psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy) through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial, conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona. Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188, PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10 hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity. Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369 enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0%) provided data at the three months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2%) at 12 months. Mean age of study subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2% were women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at work. Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need. This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice. The stability of policies for community participation in primary healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of exclusion whereby so-called 'hard to reach' groups are not adequately involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice. This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community participation in primary healthcare, for all. Background: Community participation is essential for effective implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete collaboration and communication between communities and other parties involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods: Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers, collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers, champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members, patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion: Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal, synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating findings into appropriate actions. Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial, implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones. Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension, socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population, albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate and culturally adapt decision aids. What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care, Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms, the value is the perception that people have about clinical effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response, we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model: 1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5. Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6. Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality of community life, political systems require economic, housing, education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health. 2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their actions to the social reality of each territory. Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland (Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results: Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old increased by 70% vs. a 2% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region. Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19% in Borgholm vs. 9% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital care episodes decreased 7% in Borgholm vs. 13% increase for the rest of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8% in Borgholm vs. 21% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75 years old decreased 4% in Borgholm vs. a 10% increase for the rest of Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural Swedish jurisdiction. Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a critical role for early identification and care of patients with dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from 20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450 (3.5%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over 65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3%) followed by vascular dementia 27.11%. The average age of respondents in the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50% patients under the age of 79 years, 65.6% were female and 68.4% were with elementary school. In the entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3%) said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor was hypertension (85.1%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic attacks (29.3%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4% of patients had high levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8%) acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77 (17.1%) memantine, while 247 (54.9%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4%) reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the majority of these patients (more than 50%) the reason for not receiving therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6%). Conclusion: This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare needs people with dementia. Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills is certain. Research question: 'What is the emotional experience of second and third-year medical students during their first clinical internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12 students in their second or third year of medical training at the University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often ignored and was not taken into account in the development of professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher. Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion: Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive internships and tutoring); ;",10.1080/13814788.2020.1719994,wos,General & Internal Medicine,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/13814788.2020.1719994)
Genomic and Clinical Effects Associated with a Relaxation Response Mind-Body Intervention in Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Inflammatory Bowel Disease,Other,"Kuo, B; Bhasin, M; Jacquart, J; Scult, MA; Slipp, L; Riklin, EIK; Lepoutre, V; Comosa, N; Norton, BA; Dassatti, A; Rosenblum, J; Thurler, AH; Surjanhata, BC; Hasheminejad, NN; Kagan, L; Slawsby, E; Rao, SR; Macklin, EA; Fricchione, GL; Benson, H; Libermann, TA; Korzenik, J; Denninger, JW",PLOS ONE,2015,"Introduction Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) can profoundly affect quality of life and are influenced by stress and resiliency. The impact of mind-body interventions (MBIs) on IBS and IBD patients has not previously been examined. Methods Nineteen IBS and 29 IBD patients were enrolled in a 9-week relaxation response based mind-body group intervention (RR-MBI), focusing on elicitation of the RR and cognitive skill building. Symptom questionnaires and inflammatory markers were assessed pre- and post-intervention, and at short-term follow-up. Peripheral blood transcriptome analysis was performed to identify genomic correlates of the RR-MBI. Results Pain Catastrophizing Scale scores improved significantly post-intervention for IBD and at short-term follow-up for IBS and IBD. Trait Anxiety scores, IBS Quality of Life, IBS Symptom Severity Index, and IBD Questionnaire scores improved significantly post-intervention and at short-term follow-up for IBS and IBD, respectively. RR-MBI altered expression of more genes in IBD (1059 genes) than in IBS (119 genes). In IBD, reduced expression of RR-MBI response genes was most significantly linked to inflammatory response, cell growth, proliferation, and oxidative stress-related pathways. In IBS, cell cycle regulation and DNA damage related gene sets were significantly upregulated after RR-MBI. Interactive network analysis of RR-affected pathways identified TNF, AKT and NF-kappa B as top focus molecules in IBS, while in IBD kinases (e.g. MAPK, P38 MAPK), inflammation (e.g. VEGF-C, NF-kappa B) and cell cycle and proliferation (e.g. UBC, APP) related genes emerged as top focus molecules. Conclusions In this uncontrolled pilot study, participation in an RR-MBI was associated with improvements in disease-specific measures, trait anxiety, and pain catastrophizing in IBS and IBD patients. Moreover, observed gene expression changes suggest that NF-kappa B is a target focus molecule in both IBS and IBD- and that its regulation may contribute to counteracting the harmful effects of stress in both diseases.

Group cognitive behavioural therapy with virtual reality exposure versus group cognitive behavioural therapy with in vivo exposure for social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia: a protocol for a randomised clinical trial,Other,"Arnfred, B; Bang, P; Hjorthoj, C; Christensen, CW; Moeller, KS; Hvenegaard, M; Agerskov, L; Gausboel, UK; Soe, D; Wiborg, P; Smith, CIS; Rosenberg, N; Nordentoft, M",BMJ OPEN,2022,"Introduction Anxiety disorders have a high lifetime prevalence, early-onset and long duration or chronicity. Exposure therapy is considered one of the most effective elements in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for anxiety, but in vivo exposure can be challenging to access and control, and is sometimes rejected by patients because they consider it too aversive. Virtual reality allows flexible and controlled exposure to challenging situations in an immersive and protected environment. Aim The SoREAL-trial aims to investigate the effect of group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-in vivo) versus group CBT with virtual reality exposure (CBT-in virtuo) for patients diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and/or agoraphobia, in mixed groups. Methods and analysis The design is an investigator-initiated randomised, assessor-blinded, parallel-group and superiority-designed clinical trial. Three hundred two patients diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and/or agoraphobia will be included from the regional mental health centres of Copenhagen and North Sealand and the Northern Region of Denmark. All patients will be offered a manual-based 14-week cognitive behavioural group treatment programme, including eight sessions with exposure therapy. Therapy groups will be centrally randomised with concealed allocation sequence to either CBT-in virtuo or CBT-in vivo. Patients will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment and 1-year follow-up by treatment blinded researchers and research assistants. The primary outcome will be diagnosis-specific symptoms measured with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for patients with social anxiety disorder and the Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia for patients with agoraphobia. Secondary outcome measures will include depression symptoms, social functioning and patient satisfaction. Exploratory outcomes will be substance and alcohol use, working alliance and quality of life. Ethics and dissemination The trial has been approved by the research ethics committee in the Capital Region of Denmark. All results, positive, negative as well as inconclusive, will be published as quickly as possible and still in concordance with Danish law on the protection of confidentially and personal information.

Health related virtual communities and electronic support groups: systematic review of the effects of online peer to peer interactions,Good,"Eysenbach, G; Powell, J; Englesakis, M; Rizo, C; Stern, A",BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL,2004,"Objective To compile and evaluate the evidence on the effects on health and social outcomes of computer based peer to peer communities and electronic self support groups, used by people to discuss health related issues remotely. Design and data sources Analysis of studies identified from Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, Electronics and Communications Abstracts, Computer and Information Systems Abstracts, ERIC, LISA, ProQuest Digital Dissertations, Web of Science. Selection of studies We searched for before and after studies, interrupted time series, cohort studies, or studies with control groups; evaluating health or social outcomes of virtual peer to peer communities, either as stand alone interventions or in the context of more complex systems with peer to peer components. Main outcome measures Peer to peer interventions and co-interventions studied, general characteristics of studies, outcome measures used, and study results. Results 45 publications describing 38 distinct studies met our inclusion criteria: 20 randomised trials, three meta-analyses of n of 1 trials, three non-randomised controlled trials, one cohort study, and 11 before and after studies. Only six of these evaluated pure peer to peer communities, and one had a factorial design with a peer to peer only arm, whereas 31 studies evaluated complex interventions, which often included psychoeducational programmes or one to one communication with healthcare professionals, making it impossible to attribute intervention effects to the peer to peer community component. The outcomes measured most often were depression and social support; most studies did not show an effect. We found no evidence to support concerns over virtual communities harming people. Conclusions No robust evidence exists on the effects of consumer led peer to peer communities, partly because most peer to peer communities have been evaluated only in conjunction with more complex interventions or involvement with health professionals.

This study formed part of MentALLY, a research project funded by the European Commission, which aimed to gather qualitative empirical evidence to support the provision of European mental healthcare that provides effective treatment to all adults who need it. Methods Seven focus groups were conducted with 49 health professionals (HPs), including psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, general practitioners, and psychiatric nurses who worked in health services in Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The focus group discussions centered on the barriers and facilitators to providing quality care to people with mild, medium, and severe mental health problems. Analyses included deductively and inductively driven coding procedures. Cross-country consensus was obtained by summarizing findings in the form of a fact sheet which was shared for triangulation by all the MentALLY partners. Results The results converged into two overarching themes: (1) Minding the treatment gap: the availability and accessibility of Mental Health Services (MHS). The mhcGAP gap identified is composed of different elements that constitute the barriers to care, including bridging divides in care provision, obstacles in facilitating access via referrals and creating a collaborative 'chain of care'. (2) Making therapeutic practice relevant by providing a broad-spectrum of integrated and comprehensive services that value person-centered care comprised of authenticity, flexibility and congruence. Conclusions The mhcGAP is comprised of the following barriers: a lack of funding, insufficient capacity of human resources, inaccessibility to comprehensive services and a lack of availability of relevant treatments. The facilitators to the provision of MHC include using collaborative models of primary, secondary and prevention-oriented mental healthcare. Teamwork in providing care was considered to be a more effective and efficient use of resources. HPs believe that the use of e-mental health and emerging digital technologies can enhance care provision. Facilitating access to a relevant continuum of community-based care that is responsive coordinated and in line with people's needs throughout their lives is an essential aspect of optimal care provision.",10.1186/s13033-020-00350-1,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,Health professionals; Mental healthcare gap; Europe; Optimal mental healthcare,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00350-1)

Undergraduate (N = 143) and graduate (N = 51) students reported their psychotherapy treatment history and completed self-report measures of emotional health before and approximately 1-month following the intervention. Across both samples, psychotherapy treatment history did not moderate changes in depression, anxiety, or emotional avoidance following the intervention. However, participants who were currently receiving psychotherapy began the workshop with lower coping self-efficacy than peers with no prior psychotherapy and saw larger gains in coping self-efficacy at follow-up.

High-frequency multimodal training with a focus on Tai Chi in people with Parkinson's disease: a pilot study,Not Multi User,"Toloraia, K; Gschwandtner, U; Fuhr, P",FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE,2024,"Background and objectives Cognitive decline is an important and common complication in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) since it significantly reduces the quality of life. A breakthrough in treating and preventing cognitive decline in PD remains to be achieved. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of high-frequency and intensive multimodal training in improving motor and cognitive function.Methods Twenty-eight patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and were neurologically examined. The patients of the intervention group (n = 15) underwent 2 weekly sessions of Tai Chi therapy over 4 weeks and participated in an individually tailored training program consisting of two modules (smartphone-based speech training and cognitive training). A matched control group consisted of n = 13 patients with PD who received computer-assisted cognitive training. The data were analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA.Results Four weeks of high-frequency training showed significant effects on verbal and figural episodic memory and visuospatial function in the intervention group . Compared to the control group, the cognitive performance of the intervention group improved significantly in visuospatial function and figural episodic memory. A significant improvement was also shown in the intervention group in the Tinetti Mobility Test and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The significant effects in the Tinetti mobility test remained after the 6 months follow-up.

Home ovulation tests and stress in women trying to conceive: a randomized controlled trial,Not mental health,"Tiplady, S; Jones, G; Campbell, M; Johnson, S; Ledger, W",HUMAN REPRODUCTION,2013,"STUDY QUESTION: Does the use of a digital home ovulation test have any effect on the level of stress in women seeking to conceive? SUMMARY ANSWER: No difference was found in levels of stress between women using digital ovulation tests to time intercourse compared with women who were trying to conceive without any additional aids: in addition, their use did not negatively impact time to conception in users but may provide additional benefits, including an increased understanding of the menstrual cycle, reassurance and confidence in focusing conception attempts to the correct time in the cycle. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: It has been suggested that timing of intercourse in such a way that it coincides with ovulation by using ovulation tests can lead to emotional distress; however, no study has been conducted to investigate this hypothesis specifically, until now. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION: The study was performed over two complete menstrual cycles as a prospective, randomized, controlled trial including quantitative and qualitative methods. The intervention (test) group were given digital ovulation tests to time intercourse to the most fertile time of the cycle and the control group were provided with the current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for increasing the chances of conception (intercourse every 2-3 days) and asked not to use any additional methods to time when ovulation occurs. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING AND METHODS: A total of 210 women who were seeking to conceive were recruited from the general UK population. A total of 115 women were randomized to the test group and 95 to the control group through block randomization. The positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to measure subjective stress levels, the Short-Form 12 health survey was used as a measure of general health and well-being and urine samples were measured for biochemical markers of stress including urinary cortisol. Qualitative data were collected in the form of a telephone interview upon study completion. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There was no evidence for a difference either in total stress as measured using the PSS or in total positive or negative affect using the PANAS questionnaire between the test and control groups at any time point for the duration of the study. During cycle 1, for example, on Day 6, the difference in total stress score (test-control) was -0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) -2.47 to 1.24] and on the day of the LH surge, it was 0.53 (95% CI -1.38 to 2.44). In addition, no correlation was observed between time trying to conceive and levels of stress, or between age and levels of stress, and no evidence was found to show that stress affected whether or not a pregnancy was achieved. There is also no evidence that the biochemistry measurements are related to whether a pregnancy was achieved or of a difference in biochemistry between the treatment groups. The use of digital ovulation tests did not negatively affect time to conception and with an adequately sized study, could potentially show improvement. To ensure that the results of this study were not affected by chance, we used a number of different methods for measuring stress, each of which had been independently validated. LIMITATIONS AND REASONS FOR CAUTION: Randomization occurred before the start of the study because of the need to provide the ovulation tests in readiness for Day 6 of the first cycle. As a consequence, a number of women fell pregnant during this period (22 and 13 in the test and control groups, respectively). A further 15 women were either lost to follow-up or withdrew consent prior to study start. Pregnancy rate was higher overall in the test group, so to ensure that there were sufficient data from women who failed to become pregnant in the test group, we implemented an additional biased recruitment. This second cohort may have been different from the first, although no significant differences were observed between the two phases of recruitment for any of the information collected upon admission to the study. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Women who seek medical advice while trying to conceive should not be discouraged by health care professionals from using digital ovulation tests in order to time intercourse. The cohort of women recruited to this study initially had no evidence of infertility and were looking to conceive in a non-medical setting. A separate study to assess the impact of home ovulation tests in a subfertile population would be of interest and complementary to the present study.",10.1093/humrep/des372,wos,Obstetrics & Gynecology; Reproductive Biology,stress; ovulation tests; cortisol; questionnaire; timed intercourse,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1093/humrep/des372)

Method This study is a randomized controlled trial in which the control group will receive standard follow-up care following discharge after surgery and the intervention group will receive standard follow-up care in addition to the mobile application. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with unplanned hospital visits within 30 days of discharge. The secondary outcomes are patient-reported outcomes on validated scales evaluating their quality of recovery following discharge. A sample size of 670 subjects is planned. For the primary outcome, the control and intervention groups will be compared using a generalized linear model to account for clustering of patients within centres. For the secondary outcomes, the overall scores on the Quality of Recovery 15 and Patient Activation Measure will be analysed using a linear regression model. Results It is expected that the results of this study will show that the mobile app will lead to significant improvements in unplanned hospital visits as well as improved quality of recovery for patients. Conclusion If the trial is successful, the mobile app can be easily adopted more widely into clinical practice to support patients at home following surgery.",10.1111/codi.16312,"pubmed, wos",Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery,colorectal surgery; mobile application; postoperative recovery,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1111/codi.16312)

"Home-Based Treatment for Chronic Pain Combining Neuromodulation, Computer-Assisted Training, and Telemonitoring in Patients With Breast Cancer: Protocol for a Rehabilitative Study",Other,"Conti, L; Marzorati, C; Grasso, R; Ferrucci, R; Priori, A; Mameli, F; Ruggiero, F; Pravettoni, G",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2023,"Background: Chronic pain is a disabling symptom frequently reported in patients with breast cancer with a prevalence ranging from 25% to 60%, representing a major health issue. It has negative consequences on health status, causing psychological distress and affecting quality of life. Furthermore, the clinical management of chronic pain is often inadequate, and many patients do not benefit from the administration of pharmacological treatments. Alternative therapeutic options have been implemented to improve the psychophysical well-being of patients, including neuromodulation and complementary interventions. Objective: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a home care strategy combining computerized rehabilitation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and remote telemonitoring via a web-based platform in patients with breast cancer suffering for chronic pain. Methods: A web-based structured survey aimed at monitoring chronic pain and its effect on psychological functions will be delivered to patients with breast cancer through social media and email. In total, 42 patients with breast cancer affected by chronic pain will be recruited during the medical screening visit. The patients will be randomly divided into 3 treatment groups that will carry out either tDCS only, exercise therapy only, or a combination of both over a 3-week period. All the treatments will be delivered at the patients' home through the use of a system including a tablet, wearable inertial sensors, and a tDCS programmable medical device. Using web-based questionnaires, the perception of pain (based on the pain self-efficacy questionnaire, visual analogue scale, pain catastrophizing scale, and brief pain inventory) and psychological variables (based on the hospital and anxiety depression scale and 12-item short form survey) will be assessed at the beginning of treatment, 1 week after the start of treatment, at the end of treatment, 1 month after the start of treatment, and 3 months after the start of treatment. The system's usability (based on the mobile app rating scale and system usability scale) and its involvement in the decision-making process (based on the 9-item shared decision-making questionnaire) will be also evaluated. Finally, at the end of the treatment, a digital focus group will be conducted with the 42 patients to explore their unexpressed needs and preferences concerning treatment. Results: The study project is scheduled to start in June 2023, and it is expected to be completed by August 2025. Conclusions: We expect that the combination of tDCS and telemedicine programs will reduce pain perceived by patients with breast cancer and improve their mental well-being more effectively than single interventions. Furthermore, we assume that this home-based approach will also improve patients' participation in routine clinical care, reducing disparities in accessing health care processes. This integrated home care strategy could be useful for patients with breast cancer who cannot find relief from chronic pain with pharmacological treatments or for those who have limited access to care due to poor mobility or geographical barriers, thus increasing the patients' empowerment and reducing health care costs.",10.2023/1/e49508,wos,"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",telemedicine; chronic pain; breast cancer; tDCS; transcranial direct current stimulation; home care treatment; home care; care; training; pain; cancer; quality of life; rehabilitation; telemonitoring; web platform; exercise; therapy,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2023/1/e49508)

Honoring our teachings: children's storybooks as indigenous public health practice,Not Digital,"Maudrie, TL; Grubin, F; Conrad, M; Baez, JV; Ullrich, JS; Allison-Burbank, J; Martin, L; Austin, C; Joyner, J; Ronyak, M; Masten, K; Ingalls, A; Haroz, EE; O'Keefe, VM",FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,2024,"Introduction American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) communities continue to flourish and innovate in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Storytelling is an important tradition for AIAN communities that can function as an intervention modality. To support the needs of AIAN children and caregivers, we (a collaborative workgroup of Indigenous health researchers) developed a culturally grounded storybook that provides pandemic-related public health guidance and mental health coping strategies woven with Inter-Tribal values and teachings.Methods A collaborative workgroup, representing diverse tribal affiliations, met via four virtual meetings in early 2021 to discuss evolving COVID-19 pandemic public health guidance, community experiences and responses to emerging challenges, and how to ground the story in shared AIAN cultural strengths. We developed and distributed a brief survey for caregivers to evaluate the resulting book.Results The workgroup iteratively reviewed versions of the storyline until reaching a consensus on the final text. An AI artist from the workgroup created illustrations to accompany the text. The resulting book, titled Our Smallest Warriors, Our Strongest Medicine: Honoring Our Teachings during COVID-19 contains 46 pages of text and full-color illustrations. An online toolkit including coloring pages, traditional language activities, and caregiver resources accompanies the book. We printed and distributed 50,024 physical copies of the book and a free online version remains available. An online survey completed by N = 34 caregivers who read the book with their child(ren) showed strong satisfaction with the book and interest in future books.Discussion The development of this storybook provides insights for creative dissemination of future public health initiatives, especially those geared toward AIAN communities. The positive reception and widespread interest in the storybook illustrate how braiding AIAN cultural teachings with public health guidance can be an effective way to disseminate health information. This storybook highlights the importance of storytelling as an immersive learning experience through which caregivers and children connect to family, community, culture, and public health guidance.

Hospitalized older adults' experiences of virtual reality-based group exercise therapy with cycle ergometers: An early feasibility study,Not mental health,"Hoeg, ER; Andersen, NB; Malmkjaer, N; Vaaben, AH; Uth, J",COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR REPORTS,2023,"Sedentary behavior among hospitalized older adults is a well-described challenge that can increase the risk of loss of function and mortality. Therefore, it is important to encourage physical activity (PA) during hospitalization. Exertion Games (exergames) have repeatedly been suggested as a tool to encourage and sustain motivation in rehabilitation programs. This article presents early findings from a convergent parallel mixed methods study that explored whether social presence and PA could be combined through the novel use of immersive virtual reality technology in a feasible group exercise constellation. Inpatients (n=10, 50% female, 80.3 & PLUSMN;8.2 years) were invited to participate in a bi-weekly VR group session. Most participants (62%) responded that it was a good experience to a large/great extent, which they would like to use repeatedly (76%). The technology was easy for untrained healthcare professionals and had minimal adverse events for the participants. However, a major finding illustrates that the enclosing immersiveness of the headset hindered conversation during exercise sessions. The exclusion of sight likely had a negative effect on forming relations between the participants, which conversely caused the participants to experience a lack of cohesion and relatedness with the other participants. VR-mediated group therapy may be a promising solution to existing physiotherapy practices since it may incorporate basic psychological needs. However, to optimize for social interaction, future systems will need to afford a higher degree of social presence, e.g., through avatar embodiment in a shared virtual environment, to support older adults' autonomous motivation for PA through social interaction and novel technologies.",10.1016/j.chbr.2023.100301,wos,Psychology,Virtual reality; Motivation; Rehabilitation; Self-determination theory; Social presence; Older adults,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chbr.2023.100301)
How collaborative mental health care for competitive and high-performance athletes is implemented: A novel interdisciplinary case study,Not Multi User,"Van Slingerland, KJ; DesClouds, P; Durand-Bush, N; Boudreault, V; Abraham, A",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2022,"IntroductionCollaborative care is considered a best practice in mental health care delivery and has recently been applied in high-performance sport to address athletes' mental health needs. However, how the collaborative process unfolds in practice in the sport setting has not yet been well documented. The purpose of this illustrative case study was to investigate a novel interdisciplinary approach used within the Canadian Centre for Mental Health and Sport (CCMHS) to provide mental health care to clients. Focusing on 'how' the approach was implemented, the aim of the study was to provide insight into the collaboration that occurred between mental performance and mental health practitioners to provide care to a high-performance athlete over an 11-month period, as well as factors facilitating and impeding the team's collaboration. The case involved three practitioners and a 16-year-old female athlete experiencing chronic pain, low mood, and elevated anxiety. MethodsIn the first phase of the data collection process, each practitioner engaged in guided reflective journaling to describe the case and reflect on their practice and outcomes. During the second phase, practitioners co-created a case timeline to describe the collaborative process using clinical documents. Lastly, practitioners participated in collaborative reflection to collectively reflect more broadly on collaboration practice occurring within the CCMHS and Canadian sport system. ResultsThe data depict a complex care process in which the necessity and intensity of collaboration was primarily driven by the client's symptoms and needs. A content analysis showed that collaboration was facilitated by the CCMHS' secure online platform and tools, as well as individual practitioner and team characteristics. Collaboration was, however, hindered by logistical challenges, overlapping scopes of practice, and client characteristics. DiscussionOverall, there were more perceived benefits than drawbacks to providing collaborative care. While flexibility was required during the process, deliberate and systematic planning helped to ensure success. Factors such as interdependence of collaborative practice, complementarity of practice within care teams, compensation for collaboration, in-person versus virtual delivery, and intricacies of care coordination should be further examined in the future to optimize collaborative mental health care in sport.",10.3389/fpsyg.2022.994430,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,mental health; mental illness; sport psychology; anxiety; treatment; case study,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.994430)
How robust are studies of currently permanently included digital health applications (DiGA)? Methodological quality of studies demonstrating positive health care effects of DiGA,Other,"Kolominsky-Rabas, PL; Tauscher, M; Gerlach, R; Perleth, M; Dietzel, N",ZEITSCHRIFT FUR EVIDENZ FORTBILDUNG UND QUALITAET IM GESUNDHEITSWESEN,2022,"Introduction: Since September 2020 digital health applications (DiGA) can be prescribed by physicians and psychotherapists and are reimbursed within the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) system for the first time worldwide. For full reimbursement, the manufacturers have to provide evidence based on scientific studies that the DiGA can provide 'positive health care effects'. This study aims to analyze and evaluate the methodological quality of efficacy studies of DiGA in the categories 'Nervensystem' and 'Psyche' of the DiGA register that are permanently accepted.Methods: The methodological quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for ran- domized trials (RoB 2). The risk of bias was assessed for the primary endpoint of each study according to an intention-to-treat analysis.Results: Six DiGA were assessed for their methodological quality. Randomized controlled trials were conducted for all 6 DiGA that showed a high risk of bias, which was, in particular, due to a lack of blinding of the studies. In addition, drop-outs were significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group in most studies. For most of the DiGA no published study protocol was available in advance so an analysis of a potential selective choice of the evaluation methodology was not possible.Discussion: For reasons of transparency, verifiability, and comprehensibility of the study results, registration in a study registry and, more importantly, the publication of study protocols should be man- datory before the start of the studies. In addition, studies should be blinded by comparing the DiGA with a 'sham application' to reduce the high risk of bias. Differences in the drop-out rates of the investigated stu- dies could indicate a lack of efficacy of the treatment in the intervention group, (technical) problems in the application of the DiGA, or a lack of motivation of the participants. Conclusion: The interim results 18 months after the introduction of DiGA in the German SHI system show that the studies on the evidence of the benefits of DiGA have a high potential for bias in certain areas. However, it should be positively emphasized that the manufacturers submitted randomized con- trolled trials to prove the medical benefit of the DiGAs investigated.",10.1016/j.zefq.2022.09.008,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services,Digital health applications; DiGA; Methodological quality; Health technology assessment; Risk of bias,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2022.09.008)
How's your Work Ability? Experience of Abilities and Workplace Problems in Patients with mental Illness,Other,"Muschalla, B",ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PSYCHIATRIE PSYCHOLOGIE UND PSYCHOTHERAPIE,2020,"Aim: Chronic mental disorders are not only present with symptoms, but also negative consequences on and life participation. This is especially relevant in the context of work. Diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders, which are often long-term disorders, must therefore be based on a bio-psycho-social understanding of illness according to the ICF (WHO, 2001). Differentiated description of capacities needs specific measurements.An established instrument for the description of 13 psychomental capacities, which is often used for work ability description and judgement, is the Mini-ICF-APP (Linden et al., 2009, 2015). Method: In parallel to the Mini-ICF-APP, a self-rating version has been developed, the Mini-ICF-APP-S. This article reports data from 1134 patients with chronic mental disorders. Patients with workplace problems, patients without workplace problems and patients without workplace are compared concerning their self-reported capacity profiles. Results: Patients 'without workplace and patients with workplace problems have the most serious social-medical problems. The stronger the workplace problem, the lower do the patients report their capacities. Patients without workplace problem had partly better results in a cognitive ability test as compared to patients with workplace problem or without workplace. All three patient groups were with similar frequencies in a psychotherapeutic treatment. In their capacity profiles, the most often impaired capacities were proactivity, endurance, assertiveness, and flexibility. Dyadic relationships of capacity to adjust to rules or routines were seldomly perceived as impaired. Discussion: The variance of rating in the capacity profiles shows that patients described their capacity profiles differentiatedly (rather than giving the same scoring in several dimensions). Conclusion: The Mini-ICF-APP can be used economically in diagnostics, therapy planning and social-medicine decision making (work ability decisions). By focusing on capacities (instead of symptoms), clinicians and occupational physicians may introduce the topic work ability to their patients. Speaking about capacities offers a concrete, behavior-oriented, and potentially resource-oriented view on work-related health problems and findings solutions.",10.1024/1661-4747/a000411,wos,Psychology,ICF; capacities; mental disorder; social-medicine; work ability,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1024/1661-4747/a000411)

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ICT-based InCoPE-App, which was used to assess physical and cognitive performance and deliver individualized exercise for IWD, with regard to 1) user experience of nursing assistants, and 2) trends toward the effectiveness of the intervention on physical and cognitive performance of IWD. An 18-week individualized multidomain intervention (2 x 60 min/session) was delivered to an intervention group (IG; n = 10, mean age 88.4 +/- 5.6, 70% female) by nursing assistants (n = 10, mean age 56.1 +/- 10.4, 90% female) using the InCoPE-App. A control group (CG; n = 3, mean age 87.3 +/- 3.5, 100% female) received conventional treatment. User experience was assessed among nursing assistants by different questionnaires, i.e., PSSUQ and ISONORM 9241/110-S for usability, and AttrakDiff2 for pragmatic (PQ), hedonic quality-identity and stimulation (HQI and HQS), and attractiveness (ATT). Trends toward the effectiveness of the intervention were assessed using MMSE (global cognitive function), FICSIT-4 (balance), 6MWT and TUG (mobility), and m30CST (function of lower limbs). Usability of the InCoPE-App was rated as high by nursing assistants (mean +/- SD; overall PSSUQ 2.11 +/- 0.75; overall ISONORM 9241/110-S 1.90 +/- 0.88; ATT 1.86 +/- 1.01; PQ 1.79 +/- 1.03; HQI 1.8 +/- 0.79; and HQS 1.37 +/- 0.69).

This is a subset analysis of fatigue data and associated clinical variables collected as part of the European Palliative Care Research Collaborative Computerized Symptom Assessment (CSA) study. The overall aim of CSA was to determine the prevalence of common symptoms in a mixed advanced cancer group using an electronic data collection system. Objectives. This analysis was conducted to identify factors independently associated with fatigue. Methods. Only patient records containing complete data for all three measured blood parameters in the CSA study (C-reactive protein [CRP], hemoglobin, and albumin) were included in our subset analysis (n = 720). Participants with locoregional or metastatic disease of all tumor types were included (with or without concurrent palliative anticancer treatment). A large number of symptoms were recorded using a predesigned computer program and widely used symptom measurement scales. Fatigue was measured using a well-validated three-item fatigue scale taken from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire. A logistic regression model was developed using a cutoff score based on the available normative data to define the presence or the absence of severe fatigue. Results. Cases of fatigue were independently associated with chemotherapy treatment and experiencing other symptoms such as pain and depression. There was a moderate association with hemoglobin level. However, there was no link to cachexia, albumin, or CRP. Conclusion. Severe fatigue is linked with treatment history and hemoglobin levels rather than CRP, mood, and other common symptoms in a mixed advanced cancer group. J Pain Symptom Manage 2012; 43: 226-235.

Identifying Design Opportunities for Adaptive mHealth Interventions That Target General Well-Being: Interview Study With Informal Care Partners,Other,"Yan, XH; Newman, MW; Park, SY; Sander, A; Choi, SW; Miner, J; Wu, ZK; Carlozzi, N",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can deliver personalized behavioral support to users in daily contexts. These interventions have been increasingly adopted to support individuals who require low-cost and low-burden support. Prior research has demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of an mHealth intervention app (CareQOL) designed for use with informal care partners. To further optimize the intervention delivery, we need to investigate how care partners, many of whom lack the time for self-care, react and act in response to different behavioral messages. Objective: The goal of this study was to understand the factors that impact care partners' decision-making and actions in response to different behavioral messages. Insights from this study will help optimize future tailored and personalized behavioral interventions. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with participants who had recently completed a 3-month randomized controlled feasibility trial of the CareQOL mHealth intervention app. Of the 36 participants from the treatment group of the randomized controlled trial, 23 (64%) participated in these interviews. To prepare for each interview, the team first selected representative behavioral messages (eg, targeting different health dimensions) and presented them to participants during the interview to probe their influence on participants' thoughts and actions. The time of delivery, self-reported perceptions of the day, and user ratings of a message were presented to the participants during the interviews to assist with recall.Results: The interview data showed that after receiving a message, participants took various actions in response to different messages. Participants performed suggested behaviors or adjusted them either immediately or in a delayed manner (eg, sometimes up to a month later). We identified 4 factors that shape the variations in user actions in response to different behavioral messages: uncertainties about the workload required to perform suggested behaviors, concerns about one's ability to routinize suggested behaviors, in-the-moment willingness and ability to plan for suggested behaviors, and overall capability to engage with the intervention.Conclusions: Our study showed that care partners use mHealth behavioral messages differently regarding the immediacy of actions and the adaptation to suggested behaviors. Multiple factors influence people's perceptions and decisions regarding when and how to take actions. Future systems should consider these factors to tailor behavioral support for individuals and design system features to support the delay or adaptation of the suggested behaviors. The findings also suggest extending the assessment of user adherence by considering the variations in user actions on behavioral support (ie, performing suggested or adjusted behaviors immediately or in a delayed manner).",10.2196/47813,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,mHealth intervention; mobile health; behavior change; qualitative study; user adherence; behavioral messages; general well-being,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/47813)

Results End-user (n = 38) and professional (n = 38) stakeholders including patients, dietitians, credentialed diabetes educators, nurses, medical doctors, research scientists, and exercise physiologists participated in the Delphi study. Fifty-two critical intervention characteristics were identified. Future interventions should address diet, physical activity, mental health (e.g. stress, diabetes-related distress), and functional health literacy, while advancing behaviour change support. Programs should be delivered digitally or used multiple delivery modes, target a range of population subgroups including children, and be based on collaborative efforts between national and local and government and non-government funded organisations.

This precludes the possibility of monitoring, evaluating, and reacting to the actions of individual students as they progress through the game. To do that, however, one must know what to look for because superficial measures of success are unlikely to identify unproductive behaviors such as gaming the system. (Baker in Philipp Comput J, 2011; Downs et al. in Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, USA, 2010) The research reported here advances the ultimate goal of creating educational games that can provide real time, meaningful feedback on the progress of their users, enabling teachers or the game itself to intervene in a timely manner. We present the results of an in-depth analysis of students' actions in Geniventure, an interactive digital game designed to teach genetics to middle and high school students. Geniventure offers a sequence of challenges of increasing difficulty and records students' actions as they progress. We analyzed the resulting log files, taking into account not only whether a student achieved a certain goal, but also the quality of the student's performance on each attempt. Using this information, we quantified students' performance and correlated it to their learning gain as estimated by scores on identical multiple-choice tests administered before and after exposure to Geniventure. This analysis was performed in classes taught by teachers who had participated in professional development as part of a research project. A two-tailed paired-sample t-test of mean pre-test and post-test scores in these classes indicates a significant positive difference with a large effect size. Multivariate regression analysis of log data finds no correlation between students' post-test scores and their performance on practice challenges that invite experimentation, but a highly significant positive correlation with performance on assessment challenges, presented immediately following the practice challenges, that required students to invoke relevant mental models. We repeated this analysis with similar results using a second group of classes led by teachers who implemented Geniventure on their own after the conclusion of, and with no support from, the research project.",10.1007/s10758-022-09617-7,wos,Education & Educational Research,Modeling; Science education; Logging; Assessment,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10758-022-09617-7)

Guided imagery offers promise to reduce stress and promote lifestyle behavior change to reduce disease risk in obese adolescents. Our objectives were: 1) To pilot test a new 12-wk lifestyle intervention using a randomized trial design in obese Latino adolescents, in order to determine the effects of the mind-body modality of Interactive Guided Imagery(SM) (IGI), over and above those of a didactic lifestyle education, on insulin resistance, eating and physical activity behaviors, stress and stress biomarkers; and 2) To explore the role of intervention-related changes in stress and stress biomarkers on changes in metabolic outcomes, particularly insulin resistance. Methods: Obese (BMI > 95th percentile), Latino adolescents (n = 35, age 14-17) were randomized to receive either 12 weekly sessions of a lifestyle education plus guided imagery program (GI), or lifestyle education plus a digital storytelling computer program (DS). Between-group differences in behavioral, biological, and psychological outcomes were assessed using unpaired T-tests and ANCOVA in the 29 subjects who completed the intervention. Results: The GI group demonstrated significant reductions in leisure sedentary behavior (p < .05) and increases in moderate physical activity (p < .05) compared to DS group, and a trend toward reduced caloric intake in GI vs DS (p = .09). Salivary cortisol was acutely reduced by stress-reduction guided imagery (p < .01). There were no group differences in adiposity, insulin resistance, perceived stress, or stress biomarkers across the 12-week intervention, though decrease in serum cortisol over the course of the intervention was associated with improved insulin sensitivity (p = .03) independent of intervention group and other relevant co-variates.

Immediate and Long-Term Effects of an 8-Week Digital Mental Health Intervention on Adults With Poorly Managed Type 2 Diabetes: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Boucher, E; Moskowitz, JT; Kackloudis, GM; Stafford, JL; Kwok, I; Parks, AC",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2020,"Background: Diabetes is a leading cause of years of life lost and accounts for approximately one-fourth of health care dollars spent in the United States. Many of these costs are related to poor medication adherence and lack of self-care behaviors and are thus preventable. Depression, which is more prevalent among people with diabetes than in the general population, predicts poorer management of one's diabetes, whereas positive affect predicts engaging in more positive health behaviors. Consequently, interventions that improve depression and positive affect may also improve diabetes-related outcomes among people with diabetes. Although preliminary research on the impact of such interventions among people with diabetes is promising, these studies focused primarily on in-person interventions, have had small samples, and lack long-term follow-up. Objective: This study aims to examine the short- and long-term effects of a digital therapeutic platform focused on mental health among adults with poorly managed type 2 diabetes and elevated levels of depression. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial in which adults with a type 2 diabetes diagnosis, elevated hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) levels (>= 7), and moderate to severe depressive symptoms will be randomly assigned to a positive emotion regulation skills intervention group or a sham digital intervention with only psychoeducational content. The study will take place over 14 months, including the 8-week intervention (or control) delivered via a digital therapeutic platform (Happify Health) and follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months postintervention. Throughout the intervention and for 1 week at each postintervention follow-up, participants will complete daily assessments of diabetes-related distress, diabetes regimen adherence, and mood. Our primary outcome, HbA(1c), will be self-reported every 3 months throughout the study. Secondary and exploratory outcomes will be assessed at baseline; at 8 weeks; and at 3, 6, and 12 months postintervention. Results: Recruitment is expected to begin in June 2020. Participants will begin the study as they are recruited and will finish in waves. The final wave of data collection from the 8-week intervention is expected for winter 2020, with the completion of the 12-month follow-up in winter 2021. Conclusions: Although previous research suggests that in-person psychological interventions have promising effects on both psychological and physical outcomes among adults with diabetes, digital interventions can be advantageous because they are easily scalable and reduce many barriers that prevent people from seeking treatment. This trial will provide important information about the effects of a digital mental health intervention among adults with type 2 diabetes, assessing both short- and long-term effects of this intervention on HbA1c, depressive symptoms, and other diabetes-specific outcomes. If successful, this may introduce a scalable intervention that would help reduce some of the preventable costs associated with diabetes.",10.2196/18578,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",online intervention; diabetes mellitus; type 2; mental health; randomized clinical trial; positive psychology; HbA1c,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/18578)

Several studies have assessed the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based interventions for symptoms of anxiety and depression; however, they do not relate to patients with heart disease. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of VR therapy on the mental state of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Thirty-four CAD patients with elevated anxiety or depression symptoms were recruited. After randomization, 17 participants were assigned to the intervention group, and 17 to the control group. Both groups underwent standard CR for outpatients. In the intervention group, eight VR therapy sessions were applied. In the control group, eight sessions of Schultz' Autogenic Training were applied. To assess patient mental states, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) were used, before and after 4 weeks of CR. In the intervention group, a significant decrease in HADS score was observed (19.46 pretreatment vs. 15.73 post-treatment, p = 0.003), HADS-Anxiety subscale decreased by 16.0 percent (p = 0.01) and HADS-Depression by 23.0 percent (p = 0.003). Similarly, a significant decrease in PSQ was recorded at 12.8 percent (64.73 vs. 56.47, p = 0.03). In the control group, HADS and PSQ data did not change. VR therapy significantly reduced the severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress levels in CAD patients undergoing CR.

Their distress may potentially affect their adherence to the childhood immunization schedule and the acceptance of other recommended vaccines by physicians. Objective: The study primarily aimed to assess the feasibility of using immersive virtual reality (VR) during immunization in children in primary care. The secondary aim was to determine the effectiveness of immersive VR in alleviating pain and anxiety among children, reduction of anxiety of their parents and attending nurses during immunization compared to usual care without VR. Methods: A pilot open-label randomized control trial was conducted at a public primary care clinic in Singapore. Thirty children, aged 4-10 years were randomized to an intervention group (n = 15) using VR and a control group (n = 15) without VR during immunization. Feasibility was assessed by the response rate to the use of VR. The Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) and the Children's Fear Scale (CFS) were used to determine their pain and anxiety, respectively. The anxiety level of their accompanying parents and attending nurses were evaluated using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) prior and post-immunization of these children. The FPS-R and CFS scores, and anxiety assessment for parents and nurses were assessed using Mann-Whitney U test. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess the difference in the nurses' experience of using the VR application. Results: One child refused to use the VR equipment, constituting a rejection rate of 6.7% (1/15) but no adverse event occurred in the intervention arm. The overall response rate of 88% (30/34) when the parents were approached to participate in the study, indicating feasibility of using VR in childhood immunization. In the intervention group compared to the control group, the change in scores for CFS (median -1, IQR -2 to 0; P = 0.04), parental VAS (median -4, IQR -5 to -1; P = 0.04) were significantly decreased.

Despite regular text-based training, a baseline survey of randomly selected healthcare providers revealed deficiencies in their knowledge, confidence, comfort, and care skills regarding tracheostomy. This prospective pre-post study compared the effectiveness of regular text- and VR-based intervention modules in training healthcare providers' self-efficacy in tracheostomy care skills. Methods: Between January 2018 and January 2020, 60 healthcare providers, including physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, were enrolled. For the intervention, a newly developed head-mounted display (HMD) and web VR materials were implemented in training and clinical services. Subsequently, in-hospital healthcare providers were trained using either text or head-mounted display virtual reality (HMD-VR) materials in the regular and intervention modules, respectively. For tracheostomy care skills, preceptors directly audited the performance of trainees and provided feedback. Results: At baseline, the degree of trainees' agreement with the self-efficacy-related statements, including the aspects of familiarity, confidence, and anxiety about tracheostomy-related knowledge and care skills, were not different between the control and intervention groups. At follow-up stage, compared with the regular group, a higher percentage of intervention group' trainees reported that they are strongly agree or somewhat agree that the HMD-VR simulation increases their self-efficacy, including the aspects of familiarity and confidence, and reduced their anxiety about tracheostomy-related knowledge and care skills. After implementation, a higher degree of trainees' average satisfaction with VR-based training and VR materials was observed in the intervention group than in the regular group. Most reported that VR materials enabled accurate messaging and decreased anxiety. The increasing trend of the average written test and hands-on tracheostomy care skills scores among the intervention group trainees was significant compared to those in the regular group. The benefits of HMD-VR simulations and web-VR material-based clinical services for in-hospital healthcare providers and patient families persisted until 3 to 4 weeks later.

Compared to conventional physiotherapy, activity-promoting video games are often more motivating and engaging for patients with physical impairments. This effect could be enhanced by immersive virtual reality (VR) applications that visually, aurally and haptically simulate a virtual environment and provide a more interactive experience. The use of VR-based fitness games in the early postoperative phase could contribute to improved mobilisation and have beneficial psychological effects. Currently, there is no data on the use of VR-based fitness games in the early postoperative period after colorectal surgery. MethodsThis pilot trial features a single-centre, randomised, two-arm study design with a 1:1 allocation. Patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery for colorectal cancer or liver metastases of colorectal cancer will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group. Patients randomised to the intervention group will perform immersive virtual reality-based fitness exercises during their postoperative hospital stay. Feasibility and clinical outcomes will be assessed. DiscussionEarly mobilisation after surgery is crucial for reducing many postoperative complications. VR-based interventions are easy to use and often inexpensive, especially compared to interventions that require more medical staff and equipment.

Harnessing digital technology is one of the potential ways to leapfrog many known barriers for capacity building. Aim and Context: The ongoing Virtual Knowledge Network (VKN)-National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)-Extension of Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) (VKN-NIMHANS-ECHO: hub and spokes model) model for skilled capacity building is a collaborative effort between NIMHANS and the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Centre, USA. This article aims to summarize the methodology of two randomized controlled trials funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the VKN-NIMHANS-ECHO model of training as compared to training as usual (TAU). Methods: Both RCTs were conducted in Karnataka, a southern Indian state in which the DMHP operates in all districts. We compared the impact of the following two models of capacity building for the DMHP workforce (a) the VKN-NIMHANS-ECHO model and (b) the traditional method. We use the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement to describe the methods of these two trials. Trial 1 is to evaluate the Effectiveness of addition of Virtual-NIMHANS-ECHO tele-mentoring model for skilled capacity building in providing quality care in alcohol use disorders by the existing staff of DMHP districts of Karnataka. Hub for trial 1 was set up at NIMHANS and the spokes were psychiatrists and other mental health professionals headquartered in the district level office. Trial 2 assesses the implementation and evaluation of the NIMHANS-ECHO blended training program for the DMHP workforce in a rural south-Indian district of Karnataka state. The hub for trial 2 was set up in the district headquarter of Ramanagaram. Hub specialists are DMHP psychiatrists, whereas spokes are the non-doctor workforce (including auxiliary nurse midwives [ANMs] and accredited social health activists [ASHA] workers) medical officers of primary health centers. The location of the HubHub differs in these two studies. Both trials are funded by the ICMR, Government of India Discussion: Both these trials, though conceptually similar, have some operational differences which have been highlighted.

Impact of Virtual Reality-Based Group Activities on Activity Level and Well-Being Among Older Adults in Nursing Homes: Longitudinal Exploratory Study,Good,"Li Y, Wilke C, Shiyanov I, Muschalla B.",JMIR Serious Games,2024,"Background
In addition to illness, inactivity is a risk factor for high mortality in nursing homes. Using innovative technology, such as virtual reality (VR), for meaningful group activities could provide new opportunities for solving this problem. VR interventions have already been approved as a promising method for enhancing the health of older adults.

Objective
In this study, we examined whether VR-based group activities can have a positive impact on activity level and group interaction among older adults living in nursing homes.

Methods
We conducted a longitudinal study and provided VR interventions as a group activity once a week for 4 consecutive weeks in nursing homes. Participants were recruited based on the experience of the nursing staff members and the natural decisions of the older adults. Within a virtual cottage, designed according to the needs of the target group, older adults were able to perform daily tasks that they were no longer able to do in real life, such as gardening and making pizza. Overall, 2 psychologists measured the psychosocial capacities, activities of daily life, and well-being before and after the interventions using standardized instruments.

Results
The results focus on a total of 84 older adults from 14 nursing homes who completed at least 3 VR interventions. The results indicate that several psychosocial capacities among the older adults improved, including adherence to regulations (P<.001; η²=0.122), flexibility (P<.001; η²=0.109), and group integration (P<.001; η²=0.141). Problems related to competence also showed a slight decrease (P=.04; η²=0.039). In addition, the VR intervention promoted their proactivity (P<.001; η²=0.104) and mobility (P=.04; η²=0.039). During the VR group intervention, older adults’ well-being could be maintained at a high level. The results highlight the beneficial effects of VR intervention as a meaningful activity in nursing homes, showcasing the potential of VR applications in this setting.

Conclusions
This study provides a novel and naturalistic perspective, offering new insights into the use of VR in nursing homes. The VR intervention was well accepted and fulfilled the aim of enhancing capacity and well-being. It could be a meaningful group activity in nursing homes to improve social group interaction. To provide stronger evidence, randomized controlled trials are necessary.",10.2196/50796,pubmed,NA,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/50796)
Impact of a Mobile App on Paramedics' Perceived and Physiologic Stress Response During Simulated Prehospital Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: Study Nested Within a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Lacour, M; Bloudeau, L; Combescure, C; Haddad, K; Hugon, F; Suppan, L; Rodieux, F; Lovis, C; Gervaix, A; Ehrler, F; Manzano, S; Siebert, JN",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2021,"Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) are stressful, high-stake events that are associated with low survival rates. Acute stress experienced in this situation is associated with lower cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance in calculating drug dosages by emergency medical services. Children are particularly vulnerable to such errors. To date, no app has been validated to specifically support emergency drug preparation by paramedics through reducing the stress level of this procedure and medication errors. Objective: This study aims to determine the effectiveness of an evidence-based mobile app compared with that of the conventional preparation methods in reducing acute stress in paramedics at the psychological and physiological levels while safely preparing emergency drugs during simulated pediatric OHCA scenarios. Methods: In a parent, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of 14 emergency medical services, perceived and physiologic stress of advanced paramedics with drug preparation autonomy was assessed during a 20-minute, standardized, fully video-recorded, and highly realistic pediatric OHCA scenario in an 18-month-old child. The primary outcome was participants' self-reported psychological stress perceived during sequential preparations of 4 intravenous emergency drugs (epinephrine, midazolam, 10% dextrose, and sodium bicarbonate) with the support of the PedAMINES (Pediatric Accurate Medication in Emergency Situations) app designed to help pediatric drug preparation (intervention) or conventional methods (control). The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Visual Analog Scale questionnaires were used to measure perceived stress. The secondary outcome was physiologic stress, measured by a single continuous measurement of the participants' heart rate with optical photoplethysmography. Results: From September 3, 2019, to January 21, 2020, 150 advanced paramedics underwent randomization. A total of 74 participants were assigned to the mobile app (intervention group), and 76 did not use the app (control group). A total of 600 drug doses were prepared. Higher State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-perceived stress increase from baseline was observed during the scenario using the conventional methods (mean 35.4, SD 8.2 to mean 49.8, SD 13.2; a 41.3%, 35.0 increase) than when using the app (mean 36.1, SD 8.1 to mean 39.0, SD 8.4; a 12.3%, 29.0 increase). This revealed a 30.1% (95% CI 20.5%-39.8%; P<.001) lower relative change in stress response in participants who used the app. On the Visual Analog Scale questionnaire, participants in the control group reported a higher increase in stress at the peak of the scenario (mean 7.1, SD 1.8 vs mean 6.4, SD 1.9; difference: -0.8, 95% CI -1.3 to -0.2; P=.005). Increase in heart rate during the scenario and over the 4 drugs was not different between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Compared with the conventional method, dedicated mobile apps can reduce acute perceived stress during the preparation of emergency drugs in the prehospital setting during critical situations. These findings can help advance the development and evaluation of mobile apps for OHCA management and should be encouraged.",10.2196/31748,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,cardiopulmonary resuscitation; drugs; emergency medical services; medication errors; mobile health; mobile apps; out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; paramedics; pediatrics; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; stress,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/31748)

Successful methods required to achieve improvements in PA following pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), however, are rarely reported. Therefore, we will conduct this trial to evaluate the effectiveness of using a COPD management program delivered to the patient via the KAIA COPD app, a mobile medical application, after the completion of PR. Methods: This is the protocol for a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicentered trial that will be carried out at inpatient PR hospital centers in Germany and Switzerland. The interventions will involve the use of the KAIA COPD app program (Arm 1) or an active comparator, i.e., usual care (Arm 2). Patients completing an in-hospital PR program and consenting to participate in the study will be screened with the inclusion and exclusion criteria and enrolled in the study. After fulfilling the screening requirements, the patients will be randomized into one of the two arms with parallel group assignment in a 1:1 ratio. The training program will be delivered to the participants grouped in Arm 1 via the KAIA COPD app and to participants grouped in Arm 2 via the regular recommendations or standard of care by the PI. In total, 104 participants will be included in the trial. The treatment period will last for 24 weeks. Electronic versions of questionnaires will be used to collect patient-reported assessments remotely. The primary outcome measure is the change in physical activity of the intervention group in comparison to the control group, measured over 1 week as the mean steps per day with a Polar A 370 activity tracker, from baseline (end of PR) to the 6-month follow-up. The secondary outcome measures are functional exercise capacity, health status, sleep quality, exacerbation rate, and depression and anxiety symptoms assessed at several intervals. Discussion: This study seeks to prove the effects of the KAIA COPD mobile application in COPD patients after PR. The app offers educational, exercise training plus activity monitoring and motivational programs that can be easily implemented in the patient's home setting, enabling patients to maintain the effects that are typically elicited in the short term after pulmonary rehabilitation for the long term.",10.1186/s13063-020-04538-1,"pubmed, wos",Research & Experimental Medicine,Physical activity; Smartphone application; KAIA COPD; COPD; Digital therapeutics; Maintenance; Medical mobile application,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-020-04538-1)

Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRE) uses multisensory virtual environments to increase emotional engagement during exposure therapy, and average treatment outcomes are comparable to traditional exposure therapy. However, individual factors (e.g., depression) can predict differential responses to VRE. Studies have yet to investigate whether VRE would be more effective in treating patients with dissociation compared to traditional PE. This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial explores whether dissociation predicts treatment outcomes to exposure therapy among active-duty soldiers (N = 108) diagnosed with PTSD. We also examine whether individuals reporting dissociative symptoms demonstrated differential treatment responses to VRE and PE. Results indicated a significant two-way interaction between dissociation and time in treatment, such that dissociation blunted the negative relationship between time and PTSD symptoms. Dissociation was not associated with treatment session attendance or drop out. Results also revealed no significant effect of treatment group (PE or VRE) on the relationship between dissociation and PTSD symptoms.

Research indicates that treatments for child disruptive behavior where parents are the primary agents of change are most impactful. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an effective parent management training program currently implemented in therapeutic settings within the Netherlands. Ongoing research into improving the effectiveness of PCIT is being done within these settings. To further promote the key elements of PCIT, this study focuses on creating the opportunity for parents to practice positive parenting skills more outside of the clinical setting by adding virtual reality (VR) as an additional homework element. PCIT has shown to make impactful long-term improvements in parental warmth, responsiveness, and the parent-child relationship. Through VR, parents practice the taught parenting skills out loud in the comfort of their own homes in VR scenarios. We expect that VR addition will innovatively increase the effectiveness of PCIT. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the added value of VR to PCIT by using a multiple baseline single-case experimental design (SCED). We expect to find that PCIT-VR will ameliorate positive parenting skills. By implementing the VR element, we secondarily expected that meeting the skill criteria will be achieved sooner, treatment completion rates will increase, and the parent-child relationship will be better, whereas parental stress and child disruptive behavior will decrease. Methods: A total of 15 children (aged 2-7 years) with disruptive behavior and their parents will be followed throughout the PCIT-VR treatment. Using a multiple baseline SCED with 3 phases, 15 families will fill out questionnaires weekly, in addition to having pre- and posttreatment and follow-up measurements to monitor their positive parenting skills, child disruptive behavior, parenting stress, and VR progress. Moreover, quantitative information and qualitative interviews will be analyzed visually and statistically and summarized to provide a complete picture of experiences. Results: As of February 2021, 6 families have been enrolled in the study at the moment of submission. Data collection is projected to be completed in 2023. Quantitative and qualitative results are planned to be published in peer-reviewed journals, as well as being presented at national and international conferences. Conclusions: The SCED-with its phased design, randomization, and the opportunity to replicate and assess both individual and group treatment effects-and adaptability of the VR technology are the strengths of the study. The risks of increased type I errors, maturation effects, or technological failure will be mitigated with the right statistical support.

Implementations of Virtual Reality for Anxiety-Related Disorders: Systematic Review,Good,"Oing T, Prescott J.",JMIR Serious Games,2018,"Background: Although traditional forms of therapy for anxiety-related disorders (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT) have been effective, there have been long-standing issues with these therapies that largely center around the costs and risks associated with the components comprising the therapeutic process. To treat certain types of specific phobias, sessions may need to be held in public, therefore risking patient confidentiality and the occurrence of uncontrollable circumstances (eg, weather and bystander behavior) or additional expenses such as travel to reach a destination. To address these issues, past studies have implemented virtual reality (VR) technologies for virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) to provide an immersive, interactive experience that can be conducted privately and inexpensively. The versatility of VR allows various environments and scenarios to be generated while giving therapists control over variables that would otherwise be impossible in a natural setting. Although the outcomes from these studies have been generally positive despite the limitations of legacy VR systems, it is necessary to review these studies to identify how modern VR systems can and should improve to treat disorders in which anxiety is a key symptom, including specific phobias, posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and paranoid ideations.

Objective: The aim of this review was to establish the efficacy of VR-based treatment for anxiety-related disorders as well as to outline how modern VR systems need to address the shortcomings of legacy VR systems.

Methods: A systematic search was conducted for any VR-related, peer-reviewed articles focused on the treatment or assessment of anxiety-based disorders published before August 31, 2017, within the ProQuest Central, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES databases. References from these articles were also evaluated.

Results: A total of 49 studies met the inclusion criteria from an initial pool of 2419 studies. These studies were a mix of case studies focused solely on VRET, experimental studies comparing the efficacy of VRET with various forms of CBT (eg, in vivo exposure, imaginal exposure, and exposure group therapy), and studies evaluating the usefulness of VR technology as a diagnostic tool for paranoid ideations. The majority of studies reported positive findings in favor of VRET despite the VR technology's limitations.

Conclusions: Although past studies have demonstrated promising and emerging efficacy for the use of VR as a treatment and diagnostic tool for anxiety-related disorders, it is clear that VR technology as a whole needs to improve to provide a completely immersive and interactive experience that is capable of blurring the lines between the real and virtual world.",10.2196/10965,pubmed,NA,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/10965)
Implementing Digital Trainings within Medical Rehabilitations: Improvement of Mental Health and Synergetic Outcomes with Healthcare Service,Population,"Keller, FM; Dahmen, A; Derksen, C; Kötting, L; Lippke, S",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,2021,"The need for new technologies in healthcare services has been stressed. However, little is known about the effectiveness of digital interventions integrated in psychosomatic rehabilitation processes. Data from 724 patients from psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics were analyzed with regard to the effectiveness of digital trainings indicated by a change in symptoms related to depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness from pre- to post-rehabilitation. Rehabilitation satisfaction was examined in association with reaching rehabilitation goals and satisfaction with communication. A mixed repeated measures analyses of covariance, analyses of covariance, and hierarchical stepwise regression analyses were performed. Results indicated a superior effectiveness for the intervention group receiving all offered digital treatments in addition to the regular face-to-face rehabilitation program with regard to symptoms of depression (F (2674) = 3.93, p < 0.05, eta(2)(p) = 0.01), anxiety (F (2678) = 3.68, p < 0.05, eta(2)(p) = 0.01) post-rehabilitation, with large effect sizes for both depression (d = 1.28) and anxiety (d = 1.08). In addition, rehabilitation satisfaction was positively associated with reaching rehabilitation goals and perceived communication with healthcare workers. Digital interventions appeared effective in supporting mental health of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients' post-rehabilitation.

It is surprising to see that related to public health but also psychological factors and sequelae of the pandemic, a broad knowledge was already available based upon former pandemics and disasters long before the outbreak of COVID-19. This knowledge has been used very sparsely, if at all, for health political decisions. In view of the social significance of the pandemic and its social impact, findings from group psychology and group dynamics seem to be specifically important for a better understanding of behavior within the population as well as the conceptualization of public health interventions. An increase in psychological disorders was described related to the pandemic. For the treatment of these disorders, a range of psychotherapeutic approaches including evidence-based group psychotherapy are available.

Improvements in Adolescents' Disordered Eating Behaviors in a Collaborative Care Digital Mental Health Intervention: Retrospective Observational Study,Good,"Huffman, LG; Lawrence-Sidebottom, D; Beam, AB; Parikh, A; Guerra, R; Roots, M; Huberty, J",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2024,"Background: Young people today are exhibiting increasing rates of disordered eating behaviors, as well as eating disorders (EDs), alongside other mental and behavioral problems such as anxiety and depression. However, limited access to mental health care means that EDs, disordered eating behaviors, and comorbid mental health problems are often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) offer accessible and scalable alternatives to traditional treatment modalities, but their effectiveness has not been well established among adolescents with EDs and disordered eating behaviors. Objective: This study uses data from a collaborative care pediatric DMHI to determine whether participation in a DMHI is associated with a reduction in adolescents' disordered eating behaviors. Methods: Adolescent members in care with Bend Health Inc completed the SCOFF questionnaire at baseline (before the start of care) and approximately every month during care to assess disordered eating behaviors. They also completed assessments of mental health symptoms at baseline. Member characteristics, mental health symptoms, and disordered eating behaviors of adolescents with elevated SCOFF scores at baseline (before the start of care) were compared to those of adolescents with nonelevated SCOFF scores at baseline. Members participated in web -based coaching or therapy sessions throughout the duration of mental health care. Results: Compared to adolescents with nonelevated SCOFF scores (n=520), adolescents with elevated SCOFF scores (n=169) were predominantly female and exhibited higher rates of elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms. SCOFF scores decreased over time in care with the DMHI for 61.4% (n=70) of adolescents with elevated SCOFF scores, and each additional month of participation was associated with greater improvements in disordered eating behaviors (F1,233=72.82; P<.001).

The program, Adventures aboard the S.S. GRIN, translates a proven in-person intervention into a nine-episode interactive online adventure game that provides opportunity for knowledge acquisition and skill practice. Materials and Methods: Participants (children aged 7-11 years with social skills challenges) were randomly assigned to immediate treatment group (n=33) or waitlist control group (n=36). Children in the immediate treatment condition completed the game at home over the course of 9 weeks. Before playing the game and again within 1 week of game completion, children completed surveys about social literacy, social anxiety, bullying, social self-efficacy, and social satisfaction. Results: Children who played Adventures improved significantly more from pretest to posttest than children who did not play the game in social literacy, social anxiety, bullying victimization, and social satisfaction. Conclusion: Online interactive games can be effective in improving mental health for children who struggle with social skills. For children who can access them, serious games have the potential to increase the reach of effective programs by overcoming the logistical and implementation barriers (such as cost, travel, and accessibility) that limit traditionally delivered mental health interventions.",10.1089/g4h.2015.0108,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation",Intervention; Mental health; Serious games; Social skills,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1089/g4h.2015.0108)
Improving Children's Sleep Habits Using an Interactive Smartphone App: Community-Based Intervention Study,Not Multi User,"Yoshizaki, A; Murata, E; Yamamoto, T; Fujisawa, TX; Hanaie, R; Hirata, I; Matsumoto, S; Mohri, I; Taniike, M",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2023,"Background: Sleep problems are quite common among young children and are often a challenge for parents and a hinderance to children's development. Although behavioral therapy has proven effective in reducing sleep problems in children, a lack of access to professionals who can provide effective support is a major barrier for many caregivers. Therefore, pediatric sleep experts have begun developing apps and web-based services for caregivers. Despite the substantial influence of cultural and familial factors on children's sleep, little effort has gone into developing cultural or family-tailored interventions.Objective: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of the interactive smartphone app Nenne Navi, which provides culturally and family-tailored suggestions for improving sleep habits in young Japanese children through community-based long-term trials. The study also aimed to investigate the association between app-driven improvements in sleep and mental development in children. Methods: This study adopted a community-based approach to recruit individuals from the Higashi-Osaka city (Japan) who met >= 1 of the following eligibility criteria for sleep problems: sleeping after 10 PM, getting <9 hours of nighttime sleep, and experiencing frequent nighttime awakenings. A total of 87 Japanese caregivers with young children (mean 19.50, SD 0.70 months) were recruited and assigned to the app use group (intervention group) or the video-only group (control group). Both groups received educational video content regarding sleep health literacy. The caregivers in the intervention group used the app, which provides family-tailored suggestions, once per month for 1 year.Results: A total of 92% (33/36) of the caregivers in the app use group completed 1 year of the intervention. The participants' overall evaluation of the app was positive. The wake-up time was advanced (base mean 8:06 AM; post mean 7:48 AM; F1,65=6.769; P=.01 and sleep onset latency was decreased (base mean 34.45 minutes; post mean 20.05 minutes; F1,65=23.219; P<.001) significantly in the app use group at the 13th month compared with the video-only group. Moreover, multiple regression analysis showed that decreased social jetlag (beta=-0.302; P=.03) and increased sleep onset latency SD (beta=.426; P=.02) in children predicted a significant enhancement in the development of social relationships with adults. At 6 months after the completion of the app use, all the caregivers reported continuation of the new lifestyle.Conclusions: The present findings suggest that the app Nenne Navi has high continuity in community use and can improve sleep habits in young Japanese children and that interventions for sleep habits of young children may lead to the enhancement of",10.2196/40836,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,infant sleep; app; mHealth; mobile health; behavioral intervention; sleep health; social implementation; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/40836)
Improving Integrated Mental Health Care Through an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse-Led Program: Challenges and Successes,Population,"Emerson, MR; Huber, M; Mathews, TL; Kupzyk, K; Walsh, M; Walker, J",PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS,2023,"Integrated and collaborative care delivery models have demonstrated efficacy for the management of psychiatric conditions in the primary care environment, yet organizations struggle with implementation of integrated efforts in clinical practice. Delivering care with a population focus versus face-to-face encounters with individual patients requires financial investment and adjustment in care delivery. We discuss the early implementation process of an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN)-led integrated behavioral health care program, including the challenges, barriers, and successes in the first 9 months of the program (January-September 2021), for an academic institution in the Midwest. A total of 161 Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and 162 Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) rating scales were completed on 86 patients. The mean PHQ-9 score at the initial visit was 11.3 (moderate depression); after 5 visits, it decreased significantly to 8.6 (mild depression) (P < .001). The mean GAD-7 score at the initial visit was 10.9 (moderate anxiety); after 5 visits, it decreased significantly to 7.6 (mild anxiety) (P < .001). A survey completed by 14 primary care physicians 9 months after program launch revealed improvements in satisfaction with collaboration but, most notably, in perception of access to and overall satisfaction with behavioral health consultation/patient care services. Program challenges included adapting the environment to enhance leadership roles for the program and adjusting to virtual availability of psychiatric support. A case example highlights the value of integrated care along with improved depression and anxiety-related outcomes.

Improving Patient-Centered Care for Young People in General Practice With a Codesigned Screening App: Mixed Methods Study,Not Multi User,"Webb, MJ; Wadley, G; Sanci, LA",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2017,"Background: Despite experiencing a high prevalence and co-occurrence of mental health disorders and health-compromising behaviors, young people tend not to seek professional help for these concerns. However, they do regularly attend primary care, making primary care providers ideally situated to identify and discuss mental health and lifestyle issues as part of young people's routine health care. Objective: The aim was to investigate whether using a codesigned health and lifestyle-screening app, Check Up GP, in general practice influenced young people's assessment of the quality of their care (measures of patient-centered care and youth friendliness), and their disclosure of sensitive issues. In addition, this study aimed to explore young people's acceptance and experience of using a screening app during regular health care. Methods: This was a mixed methods implementation study of Check Up GP with young people aged 14 to 25 years attending a general practice clinic in urban Melbourne, Australia. A 1-month treatment-as-usual group was compared to a 2-month intervention group in which young people and their general practitioners (GPs) used Check Up GP. Young people in both groups completed an exit survey immediately after their consultation about disclosure, patient-centered and youth-friendly care, and judgment. In addition, participants in the intervention group were surveyed about app acceptability and usability and their willingness to use it again. Semistructured interviews with participants in the intervention group expanded on themes covered in the survey. Results: The exit survey was completed by 30 young people in the treatment-as-usual group and 85 young people in the intervention group. Young people using Check Up GP reported greater disclosure of health issues (P<.001), and rated their GP higher in patient-centered care: communication and partnership (P=.01), personal relationship (P=.01), health promotion (P=.03), and interest in effect on life (P<.001). No differences were found on core indicators of youth-friendly care: trust, level of comfort, expectations met, and time to ask questions. In all, 86% (73/85) of young people felt the app was a good idea and only 1% (1/85) thought it a bad idea. Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with 14 participants found that Check Up GP created scope to address unmet health needs and increased sense of preparedness, with use moderated by honesty, motivation, app content and functionality, and app administration. Conclusions: Integrating a health and lifestyle-screening app into face-to-face care can enrich young people's experience of seeing their GP, create scope to identify and address unmet health needs, and increase patient-centered care. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of using a health and lifestyle-screening app in a diverse range of clinic types and settings, and with a diverse range of GPs and youth.",10.2196/mhealth.7816,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,adolescent; needs assessment; general practice; primary prevention; health behavior; health information technology; patient-centered care,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/mhealth.7816)
Improving adherence to rehabilitation for heart failure patients through immersive virtual reality (VIRTUAL-HF): A protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Not mental health,"Micheluzzi, V; Casu, G; Sanna, GD; Canu, A; Iovino, P; Caggianelli, G; Vellone, E",CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS,2024,"Background: To improve symptoms and reduce poor outcomes related to heart failure (HF), international guidelines recommend cardiac rehabilitation (CR), particularly for those with a reduced ejection fraction. Unfortunately, patient adherence to rehabilitation programs remains suboptimal, with dropouts ranging from 15.4 to 63.3%. An innovative and promising intervention that could improve adherence to rehabilitation is virtual reality (VR).

The aim of this study was to investigate whether a document called a question prompt list, containing suggested questions that a patient may like to ask their doctor, improved communication.Methods A prospective RCT was conducted from October 2021 to October 2022 at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide, Australia. Patients 16 years or older, seeing a general surgeon for a pre-surgical consultation, not requiring a translator, were randomized to receive a question prompt list (intervention) or standard care without a question prompt list (control). The primary outcomes were number of questions asked, talk time, and mutual eye gaze. Secondary outcomes were patient recall of information, anxiety, and consultation duration. Randomization was achieved using a computer program, with allocation concealment by opaque sequentially numbered envelopes. Patients were blinded to study group; surgeons were aware of study group, but blinded to outcomes.Results Patients (59) were randomly allocated to receive the question prompt list (31) or to the control group (28). A patient from the intervention group withdrew before consultation, resulting in 58 patients being included in the analysis. In the question prompt list consultations, 24 per cent more questions were asked (incidence rate ratio = 1.25, 95 per cent c.i. 1.10 to 1.42; P = 0.001). The intervention group recalled 9 per cent more items than the control group (incidence rate ratio = 1.09, 95 per cent c.i. 1.02 to 1.17; P = 0.012).

Improving customer well-being through two-way online social support,Good,"Zheng, QY; Yao, T; Fan, XC",JOURNAL OF SERVICE THEORY AND PRACTICE,2016,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the dynamics of online health care communities and the impact of two-way online social support on customers' well-being and patients' quality of life, at different social exclusion levels. Design/methodology/approach - An online survey in China's Anti-Hepatitis B Online Community includes 326 respondents. A combined hierarchical regression analysis and structural equation model test the hypotheses. Findings - Both receiving and giving online social support, as reciprocal altruism behaviors, enhance patients' well-being. Receiving online social support influences psychological well-being most; giving has the largest impact on existential domains. Social exclusion boosts the benefits of giving online social support but attenuates the benefits of receiving it. Research limitations/implications - This research focusses on the effects of online social support among socially excluded patients. Extensions could rely on objective instead of subjective measures and alternative methodologies to test the underlying processes. Additional insights could derive from a bidirectional perspective. Practical implications - Medical treatment institutions should leverage customer resources; health care providers should prioritize patients who feel socially excluded as effective online support providers. Health care community administrators can use several means to convince patients to contribute to communities. Originality/value - Social support in online health care communities is a collaborative service that uses customers as service resources. This study explains the collaborative service and how customers feel about their bidirectional roles. It also extends reciprocal altruism research to a health information technology realm by systematically exploring how giving, vs receiving, online social support affects customers' well-being.",10.1108/JSTP-09-2014-0188,wos,Business & Economics,Social support; Quality of life; Online health care communities; Reciprocal altruism; Social exclusion,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1108/JSTP-09-2014-0188)

The intervention was designed for breast cancer patients in the early survivorship period meeting criteria for clinical levels of psychological symptoms. MethodsPatients were randomly assigned to the immediate intervention arm (n = 61; intervention received immediately) or to the delayed intervention arm (n = 59; intervention received 5 months later). Psychological symptoms, including anxiety, depressive symptoms, emotional distress, fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), worry, and intrusive thoughts were assessed through questionnaires. Emotion regulation was assessed in a dynamic emotion regulation task and in everyday life. Assessments were completed at baseline (T1), 5 months (T2) and 10 months (T3) later. ResultsTreated patients reported lower levels of worry and intrusive thoughts. They improved their ability to down-regulate the intensity of their negative emotions when exposed to cancer-related triggers in the dynamic emotion regulation task. They reported fewer and less intense negative emotions and more positive emotions in their everyday life. Benefits were maintained 5 months later, except for positive emotions in everyday life. ConclusionsThe results showed that focusing on emotion regulation is a relevant approach in the treatment of psychological symptoms for breast cancer patients in the early survivorship period meeting criteria for clinical levels of psychological symptoms.

Improving quality of antipsychotic polypharmacy: a pilot study,Not Digital,"Hoilund, H; Galea, DP; Ringen, PA",NORDIC JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY,2020,"Background: Concurrent prescription of more than one type of antipsychotic for the same patient - antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP) - is associated with increased incidence of side effects, uncertain therapeutic benefit and general guidelines advise against it. Nevertheless, APP is common and there is little evidence about possible interventions to improve practice. Aims: To investigate the prevalence and documentation quality of APP in specialized psychiatric care and assess the feasibility and effect of a simple intervention to improve clinical practice. Methods: We examined the prevalence and the quality of documentation of APP in medical records from a large inpatient treatment department before and 6 months after an intervention, which consisted of giving feedback to doctors on their prescription practices as well as teaching about current guidelines. Prescription and documentation before and after intervention were compared between intervention and control wards. Results: One hundred and twenty-one medical records were examined at baseline. 43% of these had APP, of these 27% was satisfactory documented. After the intervention, the proportion with APP was reduced from 42% to 29% in the intervention group. There was a statistically significant interaction effect of the intervention group and the after-intervention condition on this reduction. The percentage with satisfactory documentation of APP was increased after the intervention in both groups, but we found no corresponding interaction effect. Conclusion: APP is prevalent in inpatient treatment of patients with mainly psychotic disorders but documentation of this is insufficient.

Improving sleep after stroke: A randomised controlled trial of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia,Not Multi User,"Fleming, MK; Smejka, T; Macey, E; Luengo-Fernandez, R; Henry, AL; Robinson, B; Kyle, SD; Espie, CA; Johansen-Berg, H",JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH,2024,"Stroke is frequently accompanied by long-term sleep disruption. We therefore aimed to assess the efficacy of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia to improve sleep after stroke. A parallel group randomised controlled trial was conducted remotely in participant's homes/online. Randomisation was online with minimisation of between-group differences in age and baseline Sleep Condition Indicator-8 score. In total, 86 community-dwelling stroke survivors consented, of whom 84 completed baseline assessments (39 female, mean 5.5 years post-stroke, mean 59 years old), and were randomised to digital cognitive behavioural therapy or control (sleep hygiene information). Follow-up was at post-intervention (mean 75 days after baseline) and 8 weeks later. The primary outcome was self-reported insomnia symptoms, as per the Sleep Condition Indicator-8 (range 0-32, lower numbers indicate more severe insomnia, reliable change 7 points) at post-intervention. There were significant improvements in Sleep Condition Indicator-8 for digital cognitive behavioural therapy compared with control (intention-to-treat, digital cognitive behavioural therapy n = 48, control n = 36, 5 imputed datasets, effect of group p <= 0.02,eta(2)(p) = 0.07-0.12 [medium size effect], pooled mean difference = -3.35). Additionally, secondary outcomes showed shorter self-reported sleep-onset latencies and better mood for the digital cognitive behavioural therapy group, but no significant differences for self-efficacy, quality of life or actigraphy-derived sleep parameters. Cost-effectiveness analysis found that digital cognitive behavioural therapy dominates over control (non-significant cost savings and higher quality-adjusted life years). No related serious adverse events were reported to the researchers. Overall, digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia effectively improves sleep after stroke.

However, disrupted sleep is highly prevalent after stroke and is often associated with poor motor recovery and quality of life. Previous research has shown that digital cognitive behavioural therapy (dCBT) for insomnia can be effective at improving sleep quality after stroke. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the potential for sleep improvement using a dCBT programme, to improve rehabilitation outcomes after stroke. Methods and analysisWe will conduct a parallel-arm randomised controlled trial of dCBT (Sleepio) versus treatment as usual among individuals following stroke affecting the upper limb. Up to 100 participants will be randomly allocated (2:1) into either the intervention (6-8week dCBT) or control (continued treatment as usual) group. The primary outcome of the study will be change in insomnia symptoms pre to post intervention compared with treatment as usual. Secondary outcomes include improvement in overnight motor memory consolidation and sleep measures between intervention groups, correlations between changes in sleep behaviour and overnight motor memory consolidation in the dCBT group and changes in symptoms of depression and fatigue between the dCBT and control groups. Analysis of covariance models and correlations will be used to analyse data from the primary and secondary outcomes.

Improving social functioning in people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders via mobile experimental interventions: Results from the CLIMB pilot trial,Good,"Dabit, S; Quraishi, S; Jordan, J; Biagianti, B",SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH-COGNITION,2021,"Background: Patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSD) demonstrate poor social functioning. While group-based approaches show long-term improvements, access to treatments is limited. Digital platforms hold promise to overcome barriers to treatment delivery and improve outcomes. Objective: In a parallel arm, double-blind RCT, we tested CLIMB, a clinician-assisted, adjunct to treatment that includes computerized social cognition training (SCT), ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), group teletherapy, and moderated messaging. CLIMB was compared to an active control that includes computerized general cognitive training (GCT), unstructured support groups, and unmoderated messaging. Methods: The primary outcome was social functioning. Secondary outcomes were negative symptoms and quality of life (QoL). Given the sample size, Propensity Score Models were used to ensure balanced baseline covariates. Mixed-effects models examined change over time. Results: 24 participants completed the study (12 per arm). No significant between-group differences emerged in engagement. CLIMB participants engaged in a median of 8 sessions (IQR = 2), 2.8 h of SCT (IQR = 7.5), and 2710 EMAs; control participants engaged in a median of 9 sessions (IQR = 3) and 2.2 h of GCT (IQR = 7.9). As a group, participants showed significant improvements in social functioning (p = .046), with no between-group differences. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated greater improvements in QoL (p = .025) for the active control. Conclusions: Delivering group-based mobile interventions to individuals with SSD is feasible. EMAs allow clinicians to maintain inter-session engagement, build participant self-awareness, and tailor treatment delivery. In this treatment model, whether SCT or GCT is more effective remains unclear. Further research will evaluate group-based mobile interventions to improve outcomes in SSD.",10.1016/j.scog.2021.100211,wos,Psychiatry; Psychology,"Psychosis; Social cognition; Cognitive training, mobile health",URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scog.2021.100211)
Improving spatial ability using a Web-based Virtual Environment (WbVE),Other,"Rafi, A; Anuar, K; Samad, A; Hayati, M; Mahadzir, M",AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION,2005,"Spatial ability is one of the cognitive means used in problem solving activities particularly when manipulating and processing visuo-spatial information. With the increasing use of network communication, conventional teaching and learning has shifted towards the development of network environments, online learning, real-time interaction and high quality multi-user collaboration. This paper presents our experiment using a Web-based Virtual Environment (WbVE) that has improved a group of pre-service teachers' spatial ability understanding for teaching Engineering Drawing for secondary school subjects. The experiment is carried out in Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI) comprising of 98 pre-service teachers taking the Computer Aided-Design (CAD) course. Selected subjects were pre-tested at the beginning of the semester with spatial tests focusing on mental rotation and spatial visualization to provide the baseline measurement. A desktop WbVE, which was employed and tested in the CAD laboratories to improve their spatial ability for five weeks of instructional treatment, will be demonstrated. Post-testing of spatial tests revealed significantly the overall spatial ability improvements as measured by the test scores. This paper concludes with a discussion on the impact of WbVE spatial learning that will be used as a precedent in the development of the VE teaching and learning prototypes for secondary school in Malaysia.

Treatments for clinically localized prostate carcinoma are accompanied by sexual, urinary, and bowel dysfunction and other sequelae that can result in significant distress and reduced well being. Methods capable of improving quality of life are needed that call be integrated into clinical practice. To address this need, a nurse-driven, cancer care intervention was developed and tested. METHODS. Within 6 weeks after completing treatment, 99 patients, along with their partners, were enrolled into a prospective, controlled trial and were randomized to receive the cancer care intervention or to receive standard care. Participants in the intervention arm met once each month for 6 months with an oncology nurse intervenor, who helped patients identify their quality-of-life needs using an interactive computer program. The intervener then provided education and support tailored to participants' needs. Primary Outcome variables included 1) disease-specific quality of life, including sexual, urinary, and bowel Outcomes and cancer worry; 2) depression; 3) dyadic adjustment; and 4) general quality of life. Outcomes data were collected prior to randomization and again at 4 months, 7 months, and 12 months posttreatment. RESULTS. Patients in the intervention arm experienced long-term improvements in quality-of-life outcomes related to sexual functioning and cancer worry compared with patients who received standard care. Baseline depression moderated the impact of the intervention on several other quality-of-life outcomes. CONCLUSIONS. The findings of the current study indicated that a computer-assisted, nurse-driven intervention was capable of providing durable improvements in the quality of life of men who underwent treatment for clinically localized prostate carcinoma.",10.1002/cncr.21231,"pubmed, wos",Oncology,quality of life; prostate carcinoma; psychosocial oncology; randomized controlled trial,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1002/cncr.21231)
In session extinction and outcome in Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for PTSD,Not Multi User,"Rauch, SAM; Koola, C; Post, L; Yasinski, C; Norrholm, SD; Black, K; Rothbaum, BO",BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY,2018,"Recent research emphasizes emotional engagement and between-session extinction, but no longer within-session extinction, as the primary mechanisms underlying exposure therapy for the treatment of PTSD. No previous studies have examined change in subjective units of distress (SUDS) in virtual reality exposure (VRE) for PTSD despite its potential facilitation of engagement (see McLay et al., 2012; Reger & Gahm, 2008). Using in session data from Rothbaum et al. (2014) we examined patterns of within- and between-session SUDS change in veterans receiving VRE for PTSD augmented by D-cycloserine, alprazolam, or placebo. The number of treatment sessions significantly predicted SUDS rating (t = 7.74, p < 0.001). Time in session continued to serve as a significant predictor of SUDS (t = 13.44, p < 0.001). Specifically, engagement increased within session and then reduction (extinction/habituation) was apparent across sessions. Treatment group was a predictor of SUDS rating within treatment sessions (t = 2.26, p < 0.05) but not across sessions, such that participants receiving medication experienced greater increases in SUDS within-session than those receiving placebo. Responder status was a predictor of SUDS reduction across treatment sessions (t = 4.43, p < 0.001) but did not produce an overall or within-session effect on SUDS. Thus, medications impact within-session SUDS changes but do not impact between-session reductions in SUDS- the change most consistently and closely related to magnitude of therapeutic change and responder status.",10.1016/j.brat.2018.07.003,wos,Psychology,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2018.07.003)

Many adolescents reported increased anxiety and depression as well as decreased psychological wellbeing due to the pandemic. Consequently, there is a need for psychological support that exceeds the strained resources available to schools to support young people during times of crisis and societal pressure.Objective: The present study aimed to explore the effects of an online-delivered ACT intervention to promote adolescent psychological flexibility and self-compassion and decrease psychological distress during the second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020.Methods: A total of 348 adolescents aged 15-16 were randomly divided into three equal groups: 1) the iACT student coach + virtual coach group, n = 116; 2) the iACT virtual coach group, n = 116; and 3) the control group with no intervention, n = 116). Among these adolescents, 234 participated in a pre-measurement (iACT, n = 154; control, n = 80; intent-to-treat) and completed measures of psychological flexibility, self-compassion, anxiety, and depression.Results: An investigation of all the adolescents who participated in the pre-measurement (intent-to-treat analysis, n = 234) revealed no significant differences between the three groups with regard to psychological flexibility, self-compassion, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, upon combining the two intervention groups and examining the adolescents who completed at least 30% of the Youth Compass program (per-protocol analysis, n = 137), small but significant differences between the iACT intervention and control groups were found regarding the psychological flexibility subscale valued action, self-compassion, and anxiety in favor of the intervention group.Conclusions: Active use of an ACT-based online intervention under adverse circumstances may decrease symp-toms of anxiety and increase psychological flexibility skills in adolescents.",10.1016/j.jcbs.2022.12.001,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,ACT; Adolescents; Web-based intervention; Psychological flexibility; Self-compassion; Anxiety,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2022.12.001)

Increasing engagement with an occupational digital stress management program through the use of an online facilitated discussion group: Results of a pilot randomised controlled trial,Good,"Carolan S, Harris PR, Greenwood K, Cavanagh K.",Internet Interv,2017,"Introduction: Rates of work-related stress, depression and anxiety are high, resulting in reduced work performance and absenteeism. There is evidence that digital mental health interventions delivered in the workplace are an effective way of treating these conditions, but intervention engagement and adherence remain a challenge. Providing guidance can lead to greater engagement and adherence; an online facilitated discussion group may be one way of providing that guidance in a time efficient way. This study compares engagement with a minimally guided digital mental health program (WorkGuru) delivered in the workplace with a discussion group (DG) and without a discussion group (MSG), and with a wait list control (WLC); it was conducted as a pilot phase of a definitive trial.

Methods: Eighty four individuals with elevated levels of stress from six organisations were recruited to the study and randomised to one of two active conditions (DG or MSG) or a WLC. The program WorkGuru is a CBT based, eight-week stress management intervention that is delivered with minimal guidance from a coach. Data was collected at baseline, post-intervention and at 16-week follow-up via online questionnaires. The primary outcome measure was number of logins. Secondary measures included further engagement measures, and measures of depression, anxiety, stress, comfort and enthusiasm. Quality measures including satisfaction and system usability were also collected.

Results: A greater number of logins was observed for the DG compared with the MSG; this was a medium between group effect size (d = 0.51; 95% CI: - 0.04, 1.05). Small to medium effect size differences were found at T2 in favour of the active conditions compared with the control on the DASS subscales depression, anxiety and stress, and the IWP subscales enthusiasm and comfort. This was largely maintained at T3. Satisfaction with the intervention was high with individuals in the MSG reporting greater satisfaction than individuals in the DG.

Conclusions: This study shows that access to an online facilitated discussion group increases engagement with a minimally supported occupational digital mental health intervention (as defined by the number of logins), but that this doesn't necessarily result in improved psychological outcomes or increased satisfaction when compared to access to the intervention without the group. Access to the web-based program was associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress and an increase in comfort and enthusiasm post intervention; these changes were largely maintained at follow-up.",10.1016/j.invent.2017.08.001,pubmed,NA,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2017.08.001)

Mobile phone applications (apps) can support change in health behaviors. We developed STARFISH, a mobile phone app-based intervention, which incorporates evidence-based behavior change techniques (feedback, self-monitoring and social support), in which users' physical activity is visualized by fish swimming. Objective: To evaluate the potential effectiveness of STARFISH in stroke survivors. Method: Twenty-three people with stroke (12 women; age: 56.0 +/- 10.0 years, time since stroke: 4.2 +/- 4.0 years) from support groups in Glasgow completed the study. Participants were sequentially allocated in a 2: 1 ratio to intervention (n = 15) or control (n = 8) groups.

Influence of a computer intervention on the psychological status of chronically ill rural women - Preliminary results,Good,"Hill, W; Weinert, C; Cudney, S",NURSING RESEARCH,2006,"Background: Adaptation to chronic illness is a lifelong process presenting numerous psychological challenges. It has been shown to be influenced by participating in support groups. Rural women with chronic illness face additional burdens as access to information, healthcare resources, and sources of support are often limited. Developing virtual support groups and testing the effects on psychosocial indicators associated with adaptation to chronic illness may help remove barriers to adaptation. Objective: To examine the effects of a computer-delivered intervention on measures of psychosocial health in chronically ill rural women including social support, self-esteem, empowerment, self-efficacy, depression, loneliness, and stress. Methods: An experimental design was used to test a computer-delivered intervention and examine differences in psychosocial health between women who participated in the intervention (n = 44) and women in a control group (n = 56). Results: Differences between women who participated in the intervention and controls were found for self-esteem, F(1,98) = 5.97, p=.016; social support, F(1,98) = 4.43, p=.038; and empowerment, F(1,98) = 6.06, p =.016. A comparison of means for depression, loneliness, self-efficacy, and stress suggests that differences for other psychosocial variables are possible. Discussion: The computer-based intervention tested appears to result in improved self-esteem, social support, and empowerment among rural women with chronic illness.

Information and communication technology-based interventions for suicide prevention implemented in clinical settings: a scoping review,Not Multi User,"Shin, HD; Durocher, K; Sequeira, L; Zaheer, J; Torous, J; Strudwick, G",BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,2023,"BackgroundA large number of information and communication technology (ICT) based interventions exist for suicide prevention. However, not much is known about which of these ICTs are implemented in clinical settings and their implementation characteristics. In response, this scoping review aimed to systematically explore the breadth of evidence on ICT-based interventions for suicide prevention implemented in clinical settings and then to identify and characterize implementation barriers and facilitators, as well as evaluation outcomes, and measures.MethodsWe conducted this review following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. A search strategy was applied to the following six databases between August 17-20, 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts. We also supplemented our search with Google searches and hand-searching reference lists of relevant reviews. To be included in this review, studies must include ICT-based interventions for any spectrum of suicide-related thoughts and behaviours including non-suicidal self-injury. Additionally, these ICTs must be implemented in clinical settings, such as emergency department and in-patient units. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist to prepare this full report.ResultsThis review included a total of 75 citations, describing 70 studies and 66 ICT-based interventions for suicide prevention implemented in clinical settings. The majority of ICTs were computerized interventions and/or applications (n = 55). These ICTs were commonly used as indicated strategies (n = 49) targeting patients who were actively presenting with suicide risk. The three most common suicide prevention intervention categories identified were post-discharge follow-up (n = 27), screening and/or assessment (n = 22), and safety planning (n = 20). A paucity of reported information was identified related to implementation strategies, barriers and facilitators. The most reported implementation strategies included training, education, and collaborative initiatives. Barriers and facilitators of implementation included the need for resource supports, knowledge, skills, motivation as well as engagement with clinicians with research teams. Studies included outcomes at patient, clinician, and health system levels, and implementation outcomes included acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, and penetration.ConclusionThis review presents several trends of the ICT-based interventions for suicide prevention implemented in clinical settings and identifies a need for future research to strengthen the evidence base for improving implementation. More effort is required to better understand and support the implementation and sustainability of ICTs in clinical settings.

Innovation in Technology-Aided Psychotherapy Through Human Factors/Ergonomics: Toward a Collaborative Approach,Good,"DeLucia, PR; Harold, SA; Tang, YY",JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY PSYCHOTHERAPY,2013,"Technologies are being used increasingly to aid psychotherapy and are becoming an integral part of mental health treatment. Although prior studies compared technology- aided psychotherapy (TAP) to traditional treatments, there are insufficient studies of the impact that specific design parameters and use of the technologies may have on the client and therapist, and treatment outcomes. This requires an understanding of human-technology interaction, which is the focus of the field of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HF/E). The goal of this article is to raise awareness of the importance of the human-technology interaction in TAP, and to foster collaborations between psychotherapists and HF/E professionals. Toward these aims, this article examines the implications of findings in HF/E for the use of technologies (videoconferencing, text-based communication, and virtual environments) in psychotherapy. It is suggested that the manner in which technologies are designed and used may have important effects on the therapeutic alliance and treatment outcomes, and in some cases (side effects of virtual reality) the health and safety of the client. Future research should examine effects of specific design factors on treatment including variables such as the visibility of gestures and degree of eye contact during videoconferencing, response delays during text-messaging, and presence and adverse effects when using virtual environments. Studies that compare TAP to traditional methods should report as much detail as possible about the human-technology interaction.

An accessible, insurance-reimbursable model for implementation in patient-centered medical homes within US healthcare systems has promise for patients with multi-morbid conditions. Clarifying both the dose needed to impact anxiety, depression and self-management, and the design requirements for accessible primary care implementation, is essential. Methods We tested feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of Mindfulness Training for Primary Care (MTPC), an 8-week, referral-based, insurance-reimbursable mindfulness program integrated within primary care, compared with a Low-Dose Comparator (LDC), consisting of a 60-minute mindfulness introduction plus referral to community and digital resources. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and 8 weeks. MTPC is trauma-informed, incorporates mindfulness-oriented behavior change skills, and is designed to target anxiety, depression, stress, and chronic illness self-management. Participants scheduled a PCP visit to co-create a self-management action plan during week 6. Results Primary care providers (PCP) referred 344 patients over 14 months. Eighty-one participants with DSM-V anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, trauma- and stress-related disorders participated in this pilot randomized-controlled comparative effectiveness trial [MTPC (n=54); LDC (n=27)]. These data suggest that MTPC was more effective than LDC for reducing anxiety (p=0.01), enhancing mindfulness (p=0.02) and self-compassion (p=0.001), and for catalyzing self-management behavior change through action plan initiation (OR=4.34, p=0.03). Conclusions MTPC was successfully integrated into a health system, was billed to insurance, and was acceptable to a diverse primary care population. Replication with a larger study and further accessibility adaptations are needed to confirm and expand these pilot results.

Yet, only 50% of Australian adults meet the aerobic physical activity guidelines and 9-19% meet the resistance-based physical activity guidelines. The aim of this study is to enhance community-based aerobic and resistance-based physical activity through the use of publicly available outdoor exercise equipment, social support and smartphone technology. Research design and methods: The ecofit intervention will be evaluated using a two-arm randomized controlled trial. A total of 240 adults (aged 18-80) will be recruited and randomly allocated to either the ecofit intervention or a 'wait-list' control group. Both groups will have access to the two types of outdoor park exercise equipment, but the intervention group will be given access to the purpose-built ecofit app and a 90-min introductory group training session. To promote social support, participants can enrol in a group of up to four individuals and access the ecofit Facebook group. The ecofit app include workout plans that can be tailored to different locations, difficulty levels and workout-types (i.e., resistance-only or combined resistance and aerobic workouts). Outcome assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3- (primary-end point) and 9-months follow-up. The primary outcomes are upper and lower body muscular fitness. The secondary outcomes include physical activity, body composition, aerobic fitness, body mass index, self-report resistance-based physical activity, and mental health outcomes. The cost-effectiveness of the study will also be evaluated. Discussion: ecofit is an innovative, multi-component physical activity intervention that integrates smartphone technology, social support and the outdoor built environment to promote community-based aerobic and resistance-based physical.

Recently, it was demonstrated that ICU-specific virtual reality (ICU-VR) is a feasible and acceptable intervention with potential mental health benefits. However, its effect on mental health and ICU aftercare in COVID-19 ICU survivors is unknown. Objective: This study aimed to explore the effects of ICU-VR on mental health and on patients' perceived quality of, satisfaction with, and rating of ICU aftercare among COVID-19 ICU survivors. Methods: This was a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized to either the ICU-VR (intervention) or the control group. All patients were invited to an COVID-19 post-ICU follow-up clinic 3 months after hospital discharge, during which patients in the intervention group received ICU-VR. One month and 3 months later (4 and 6 months after hospital discharge), mental health, quality of life, perceived quality, satisfaction with, and rating of ICU aftercare were scored using questionnaires. Results: Eighty-nine patients (median age 58 years; 63 males, 70%) were included. The prevalence and severity of psychological distress were limited throughout follow-up, and no differences in psychological distress or quality of life were observed between the groups. ICU-VR improved satisfaction with (mean score 8.7, SD 1.6 vs 7.6, SD 1.6 [ICU-VR vs control]; t64=-2.82, P=.006) and overall rating of ICU aftercare (mean overall rating of aftercare 8.9, SD 0.9 vs 7.8, SD 1.7 [ICU-VR vs control]; t64=-3.25; P=.002) compared to controls. ICU-VR added to the quality of ICU aftercare according to 81% of the patients, and all patients would recommend ICU-VR to other ICU survivors. Conclusions: ICU-VR is a feasible and acceptable innovative method to improve satisfaction with and rating of ICU aftercare and adds to its perceived quality. We observed a low prevalence of psychological distress after ICU treatment for COVID-19, and ICU-VR did not improve psychological recovery or quality of life. Future research is needed to confirm our results in other critical illness survivors to potentially facilitate ICU-VR's widespread availability and application during follow-up.",10.1186/s13063-021-05271-z,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,SARS-CoV-2; intensive care; post-intensive care syndrome; virtual reality; quality of life; satisfaction; COVID-19,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-021-05271-z)

Distance-learning students are particularly burdened and have limited access to conventional university health services. Interventions for stress are sought after in distance learners and may help increase treatment coverage. Internet-based interventions have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating depression, but it remains unclear if interventions directed at academic stress also have this potential. Aim: The trial presented here investigates the effectiveness of an Internet- and App-based stress intervention in distance-learning students with elevated levels of depression. Methods: A sample of N = 200 students of a large German distance university with elevated levels of depression [Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale (CES-D) >= 16] will be randomly assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress management intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG) receiving an Internet-based psychoeducational program for academic stress. The IG consists of eight Internet-based sessions promoting stress management skills using cognitive-behavioral and problem-solving techniques. A mobile App will be employed to facilitate training transfer. Self-report data will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1; 7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up (T2). Potential moderators will be assessed at baseline. The primary outcome is depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and academic outcomes. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat principle along with sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings. Additional health economic analyses will be conducted.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether an Internet-assisted intervention using whole-population screening that targets the most symptomatic 4-year-old children is effective at 6 and 12 months after the start of treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 2-parallel-group randomized clinical trial was performed from October 1, 2011, through November 30, 2013, at a primary health care clinic in Southwest Finland. Data analysis was performed from August 6, 2015, to December 11, 2015. Of a screened population of 4656 children, 730 met the screening criteria indicating a high level of disruptive behavioral problems. A total of 464 parents of 4-year-old children were randomized into the Strongest Families Smart Website (SFSW) intervention group (n = 232) or an education control (EC) group (n = 232). INTERVENTIONS The SFSW intervention, an 11-session Internet-assisted parent training program that included weekly telephone coaching. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child Behavior Checklist version for preschool children (CBCL/1.5-5) externalizing scale (primary outcome), other CBCL/1.5-5 scales and subscores, Parenting Scale, Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits, and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. All data were analyzed by intention to treat and per protocol. The assessments were made before randomization and 6 and 12 months after randomization. RESULTS Of the children randomized, 287 (61.9%) were male and 79 (17.1%) lived in other than a family with 2 biological parents. At 12-month follow-up, improvement in the SFSW intervention group was significantly greater compared with the control group on the following measures: CBCL/1.5-5 externalizing scale (effect size, 0.34; P < .001), internalizing scale (effect size, 0.35; P < .001), and total scores (effect size, 0.37; P < .001); 5 of 7 syndrome scales, including aggression (effect size, 0.36; P <.001), sleep (effect size, 0.24; P = .002), withdrawal (effect size, 0.25; P = .005), anxiety (effect size, 0.26; P = .003), and emotional problems (effect size, 0.31; P = .001); Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits callousness scores (effect size, 0.19; P = .03); and self-reported parenting skills (effect size, 0.53; P < .001).

Internet-Based Intervention Compared to Brief Intervention for Smoking Cessation in Brazil: Pilot Study,Not mental health,"Machado, NM; Gomide, HP; Bernardino, HS; Ronzani, TM",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Smoking is still the leading cause of preventable death. Governments and health care providers should make available more accessible resources to help tobacco users stop. Objective: This study describes a pilot longitudinal study that evaluated the efficacy of an internet-based intervention compared to the brief intervention for smoking cessation among Brazilians. Methods: Eligible participants were recruited and randomly allocated to one of the two interventions. Measures were drawn by comparing cessation rates, motivation scores, and sought treatment between groups, assessed 1 and 3 months after the intervention. Inferential analysis was performed to compare the participants' characteristics, and the intention to treat was calculated. Results: A total of 49 smokers were enrolled in this study (n=25, 51% in the brief intervention group; n=24, 49% in the internet-based intervention group). Mean age was 44.5 (SD 13.3) years; most were male (n=29, 59.2%), had elementary school (n=22, 44.9%), smoked 14.5 cigarettes per day on average (SD 8.6), and had a mean score of 4.65 for nicotine dependence and 5.7 for motivation to quit. Moreover, 35 (71%) participants answered follow-up 1, and 19 (39%) answered follow-up 2. The results showed similar rates of cessation and reduction for both intervention groups. Conclusions: The internet-based intervention was slightly more effective for smoking cessation, while the brief intervention was more effective in reducing the number of cigarettes smoked per day. This difference was small and had no statistical significance even after adjusting for intention-to-treat analysis.

Internet-delivered psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) have been developed to increase accessibility and address common help-seeking barriers, especially during pandemic period.The objective of this trial is to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of iCBT on reducing depressive symptoms among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic with the overall goal of preventing depression recurrence in the first 12 months postpartum. Methods: A multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted where 300 pregnant women early in their third trimester will be screened for depression symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during a routine obstetrical visit. Eligible and consenting women with a score greater than 9 will be randomly allocated (1:1) to either intervention group or control group. ICBT involving the completion of 7 weekly online modules will be delivered via a well-designed perinatal mental healthcare app. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of iCBT on reducing depression symptoms among pregnant Chinese women starting from their third trimester. The secondary objectives are to examine the effect of iCBT on anxiety, sleep quality, social support, parenting stress, co-parenting relationship, and infant development. Discussion: This multi-center randomized controlled trial has been planned in accordance with best practices in behavioral trial design. The internet-based intervention addressed the needs of pregnant women during a major pandemic where face-to-face therapy is not preferable.

Digital interventions have emerged as a solution to overcome this hindered access to evidence-based family interventions.Objective The present pilot study evaluates the feasibility and potential efficacy of the first German moderated online psychoeducation and support programme (ePSP) for relatives of people with early psychosis, with the additional purpose to improve accessibility and reduce waiting times.Methods A pre-post study was performed. A brief recruitment period was pre-established (10 weeks) to test potential improvement of regular therapy waiting times in Germany. A total of 25 relatives of people with early psychosis were recruited and received the 12-week moderated online intervention. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at post intervention. Acceptance of the intervention and the user's experience were also evaluated at post intervention.Results Recruitment, retention rates and qualitative data support the feasibility and acceptability of the ePSP. Significant positive effects of the interventions were found on key therapeutic targets, including both primary outcomes (i.e., perceived stress and beliefs about the illness). Twenty-one participants also completed the open-ended questions of the user experience questionnaire, which yielded three main themes: most important modules, difficulties in using the programme and ways to improve ePSP.Discussion These results provide preliminary efficacy estimates for a fully powered RCT to investigate superiority (or equipoise) effects of the ePSP in comparison to the routine face-to-face family therapy groups. This future RCT will also allow further exploration of ePSP to improve access to psychological therapy for relatives of young people with psychosis, also in relation to the new ground-breaking Digital Healthcare Act in Germany.",10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1248526,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,early psychosis; family intervention; digital mental health; digitalisation; psychotherapy access,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1248526)

While successful state-of-the art cognitive behavioral interventions exist, there is still a lack of available experts for treatment at home, where most symptoms manifest. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) could overcome these restrictions; however, studies about iCBT in children with OCD are rare and mostly target computerized self-help resources and only email contact with the therapist. Therefore, we intended to build up and to evaluate an iCBT approach for children with OCD, replacing successful elements of traditional in-office face-to-face CBT, with face-to-face teleconferences, online materials, and apps. Methods: With the help of a pilot feasibility study, we developed the iCBT consisting of 14 teleconference sessions with the child and parents. The sessions are supported by an app assessing daily and weekly symptoms and treatment course completed by children and parents. Additionally, we obtain heart rate and activity scores from the child via wristbands during several days and exposure sessions. Using a waiting list randomized control trial design, we aim to treat and analyze 20 children with OCD immediately after a diagnostic session whereas the control group of another set of 20 OCD patients will be treated after waiting period of 16 weeks. We will recruit 30 patients in each group to take account for potential dropouts. Outcomes for the treatment group are evaluated before randomization (baseline, t0), 16 weeks (end of treatment, t1), 32 weeks (follow-up 1, t2), and 48 weeks after randomization (follow-up 2, t3). For the waiting list group, outcomes are measured before the first randomization (baseline), at 16 weeks (waiting list period), 32 weeks (end of treatment), 48 weeks after the first randomization (follow-up I), and 64 weeks after the first randomization (follow-up II). Discussion: Based on our experience of feasibility during the pilot study, we were able to develop the iCBT approach and the current study will investigate treatment effectiveness. Building up an iCBT approach, resembling traditional in-office face-to-face therapy, may ensure the achievement of well-known therapy effect factors, the acceptance in both patients and clinicians, and the wide distribution within the health system.",10.1186/s13063-022-06062-w,wos,Research & Experimental Medicine,Internet psychotherapy; App; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Randomized controlled TRIAL; Children,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-022-06062-w)

Internet-facilitated interventions for informal caregivers of patients with neurodegenerative disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis,Good,"Boyt, N; Ho, AK; Morris-Bankole, H; Sin, J",DIGITAL HEALTH,2022,"Objective This systematic review explored the effectiveness of internet-delivered interventions in improving psychological outcomes of informal caregivers for neurodegenerative-disorder (ND) patients. Methods We searched seven databases for English-language papers published from 1999 to May 2021. Study-eligibility required that interventions used a minimum 50% internet-facilitation, targeting unpaid, adult informal caregivers of community-based ND-patients. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and pre-post evaluative studies reporting outcomes for at least one-time point post-intervention. Independent quality checks on abstract and full-text screening were completed. Data extraction encompassed interventions' features, approaches, theoretical bases and delivery-modes. The Integrated quality Criteria for the Review Of Multiple Study designs (ICROMS) framework assessed risk of bias. Alongside narrative synthesis, we calculated meta-analyses on post-intervention using outcome measures from at least two RCTs to assess effectiveness. Results Searches yielded 51 eligible studies with 3180 participants. In 48 studies, caregivers supported a dementia-diagnosed individual. Intervention-durations encompassed four weeks to 12 months, with usage-frequency either prescribed or participant-determined. The most frequently-used approach was education, followed by social support. We calculated meta-analyses using data from 16 RCTs. Internet-delivered interventions were superior in improving mastery (g = 1.17 [95% CI; 0.1 to 2.24], p = 0.03) and reducing anxiety (g = -1.29 [95% CI; -1.56 to -1.01], p < 0.01), compared to all controls. Findings were equivocal for caregivers' quality of life, burden and other outcomes. High heterogeneity reflected the multifarious combinations of approaches and delivery-modes, precluding assessment of the most efficacious intervention features. Analyses using burden and self-efficacy outcomes' follow-up data were also non-significant compared to all comparator-types. Although 32 studies met the ICROMS threshold scores, we rated most studies' evidence quality as 'very-low'. Conclusions This review demonstrated some evidence for the efficacy of internet-delivered interventions targeting informal ND-caregivers. However, more rigorous studies, with longer follow-ups across outcomes and involving NDs other than dementia, are imperative to enhance the knowledge-base.",10.1177/20552076221129069,wos,"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Informatics",digital; general; internet; general; informal caregivers; neurodegenerative disorders; dementia; disease; Alzheimer disease; online; general; web-based; systematic review; carer,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1177/20552076221129069)
Interpersonal Psychotherapy: A Scoping Review and Historical Perspective (1974-2017),Not Digital,"Ravitz, P; Watson, P; Lawson, A; Constantino, MJ; Bernecker, S; Park, J; Swartz, HA",HARVARD REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY,2019,"Background: Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) is an affect- and relationally focused, time-limited treatment supported by research spanning >4 decades. IPT focuses on stressful interpersonal experiences of loss, life changes, disputes, and social isolation. It emphasizes the role of relationships in recovery. This scoping review describes, within a historical perspective, IPT's evolution as an evidence-supported treatment of psychiatric disorders. Methods: English-language publications (n = 1119) identified via EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases (1974-2017), augmented with manual reference searches, were coded for clinical focus, population demographics, format, setting, publication type, and research type. Quantitative and qualitative analyses identified IPT publications' characteristics and trends over four epochs of psychotherapy research. Results: IPT literature primarily focused on depression (n = 772 articles; 69%), eating disorders (n = 135; 12%), anxiety disorders (n = 68; 6%), and bipolar disorder (n = 44; 4%), with rising publication rates and numbers of well-conducted randomized, controlled trials over time, justifying inclusion in consensus treatment guidelines. Research trends shifted from efficacy trials to effectiveness studies and population-based dissemination initiatives. Process research examined correlates of improvement and efficacy moderators. Innovations included global initiatives, prevention trials, and digital, web-based training and treatment. Conclusion: Sparked by clinical innovations and scientific advances, IPT has evolved as an effective treatment of psychiatric disorders across the lifespan for diverse patients, including underserved clinical populations. Future research to elucidate mechanisms of change, improve access, and adapt to changing frameworks of psychopathology and treatment planning is needed. IPT addresses the universal centrality of relationships to mental health, which is as relevant today as it was over 40 years ago.",10.1097/HRP.0000000000000219,wos,Psychiatry,brief structured psychotherapies; evidence-supported psychotherapies; Interpersonal Counseling (IPC); Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT),URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1097/HRP.0000000000000219)

However, emerging data suggest that men's use of online mental health interventions is low, and when used, early attrition is common. In this com-mentary, we hypothesise that men's common lack of engagement with online mental health interventions may reflect limited attention being paid to the needs and preferences of potential users during their development. We outline a series of considerations that we believe are important to advance the development of acceptable, effective online mental health interventions for men: (1) men's diverse and intersecting characteristics, circumstances, and needs; (2) centring positive, progressive masculinities; and (3) listening to, learning from, and working in partnership with men to develop interventions.

Intervention and Improved Well-Being of Basic Science Researchers During the COVID 19 Era: A Case Study,Good,"Kumar, S; Kodidela, S; Kumar, A; Gerth, K; Zhi, KN",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2020,"The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected individuals of all categories, irrespective of their geographical locations, professions, gender, or race. As a result of full or partial lock-down and stay-at-home orders, the well-being and productivity of individuals were severely affected. Since basic science research requires laboratory experiments, the work-from-home strategy hurt their productivity. In addition, the combination of decreased productivity and staying at home is likely to compromise their well-being by causing stress and anxiety. In this case study, a strategy was developed to engage researchers through listening and learning, motivation, and empowerment, using regular virtual sessions. Through these virtual sessions, research work was prioritized and coordinated, from idea conception to writing research papers and grant proposals. Perceived stress scores (PSS) and COVID-19-related stress (COVID-SS) scores were measured to evaluate general and COVID-19-induced stress, respectively, every month from March to July 2020 during the COVID-19 era. The result showed a significant improvement in both the PSS and the COVID-SS scores of the intervention group compared to the control group. In addition, while there was no/minimal change in PSS and COVID-SS scores from March to subsequent months until July for the control group, the intervention groups showed significant and consistent improvement in both scores in the intervention group.

The present study examined the link between changes in personality traits and self-esteem during a coaching intervention for personality change. We used data (N = 1,179) from a 3-month digital coaching intervention study with three measurement occasions (pretest, posttest, follow-up) across 6 months and focused on the three largest intervention groups, which included participants who wanted to decrease negative emotionality (n = 406), increase extraversion (n = 375), or increase conscientiousness (n = 398). Accordingly, we focused on the associations between self-esteem and the three personality traits that were targeted in the intervention groups. The main results are as follows: First, self-esteem increased on average for those participants who wanted to decrease their negative emotionality or increase their extraversion. Second, the rates of change in personality traits and self-esteem were strongly associated with each other, most notably between negative emotionality and self-esteem. Third, these associations were similar across all three intervention groups and also between the intervention and postintervention phase of the study, indicating a more general pattern of correlated change.

Interventions for Perinatal Depression and Anxiety in Fathers: A Mini-Review,Not Multi User,"Rodrigues, AL; Ericksen, J; Watson, B; Gemmill, AW; Milgrom, J",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2022,"Background and ObjectivesUp to 10% of fathers experience perinatal depression, often accompanied by anxiety, with a detrimental impact on the emotional and behavioural development of infants. Yet, few evidence-based interventions specifically for paternal perinatal depression or anxiety exist, and few depressed or anxious fathers engage with support. This mini-review aims to build on the evidence base set by other recent systematic reviews by synthesising more recently available studies on interventions for paternal perinatal depression and anxiety. Secondarily, we also aimed to identify useful information on key implementation strategies, if any, that increase the engagement of men. MethodsWe drew upon three major previous systematic reviews and performed an updated search of PubMed/Medline; Psycinfo; Cochrane Database; Embase and Cinahl. The search was limited to trials, feasibility studies or pilot studies of interventions published between 2015 and 2020 that reported on fathers' perinatal mental health. We included psychological, educational, psychosocial, paternal, couple-focused, or group therapies, delivered face-to-face, via telephone and/or online that reported on either paternal depression, anxiety or both. ResultsEleven studies satisfied search criteria (5 of which were not included in previous reviews). The majority were randomised controlled trials. Most interventions incorporated counselling, therapy or psychoeducation and took an indirect approach to perinatal mental health through antenatal or postnatal education and were couple-focused. No studies reported a presence of diagnosed depression or anxiety at baseline, although five studies reported a positive effect on sub-threshold symptoms. DiscussionThere was some evidence that these approaches may be useful in the initial engagement of fathers with perinatal supports and improve depression and anxiety scores. No studies targeted the explicit treatment of clinically depressed or anxious men, and this remains the most substantial gap in the peer-reviewed evidence base. Our results highlight the need to deliver perinatal interventions specifically designed for men and evaluate them in populations with clinical levels of depressive and anxious symptomatology.",10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744921,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,postnatal; depression; anxiety; mental health; digital interventions; treatment; psychological distress; father,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744921)
Interventions for enhancing consumers' online health literacy,Not Multi User,"Car, J; Lang, B; Colledge, A; Ung, C; Majeed, A",COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,2011,"Background Access to health information is critical to enable consumers to participate in decisions on health. Increasingly, such information is accessed via the internet, but a number of barriers prevent consumers making effective use of it. These barriers include inadequate skills to search, evaluate and use the information. It has not yet been demonstrated whether training consumers to use the internet for health information can result in positive health outcomes. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for enhancing consumers' online health literacy (skills to search, evaluate and use online health information). Search strategy We searched: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group Specialised Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2008); MEDLINE (Ovid); EMBASE (Ovid); CINAHL (Dialog); ERIC (CSA Illumina); LISA (CSA Illumina); PsycINFO (Ovid); Index to scientific and technical proceedings; SIGLE; ASLIB Index to Theses; ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts; National Research Register/UK CRN Portfolio database; Current Controlled Trials - MetaRegister of Controlled Trials. We searched all databases for the period January 1990 to March 2008. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs and associated economic evaluations, quasi-RCTs, interrupted time series analyses, and controlled before and after (CBA) studies assessing interventions to enhance consumers' online health literacy, in any language. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed their quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for clarification and to seek missing data. We presented results as a narrative and tabular summary, and calculated mean differences where appropriate. Main results We included two studies: one randomised controlled trial (RCT) and one controlled before and after (CBA) study with a combined total of 470 participants. The RCT compared internet health information classes with patient education classes for participants with HIV infection. Only the RCT, which we rated as having a moderate risk of bias, reported statistically significant positive effects for primary outcomes related to online health literacy in the intervention group, for the following outcomes: 'Self-efficacy for health information seeking', 'health information evaluation skills' and the 'number of times the patient discussed online information with a health provider'. The CBA, which we rated as having a high risk of bias, compared internet health information classes with a control group receiving no intervention among healthy adults aged 50+. It showed significant positive changes only in a secondary (behavioural) outcome in the intervention group, regarding the readiness to adopt the internet as a tool for preventive health information. No adverse effects were reported. There is low quality evidence that such interventions may improve some outcomes relevant to online health literacy in certain populations. Authors' conclusions Due to the small number of studies and their variable methodological quality, the evidence is too weak to draw any conclusions about implications for the design and delivery of interventions for online health literacy. There is a need for well-designed RCTs to investigate the effects of such interventions. These should involve different participants (in terms of disease status, age, socio-economic group and gender) to analyse the extent to which online health literacy reduces a barrier to using the internet for health information. Trials should be conducted in different settings and should examine interventions to enhance consumers' online health literacy (search, appraisal and use of online health information) like internet training courses, measuring outcomes up to at least one year after the intervention to estimate the sustainability of the intervention effects.",10.1002/14651858.CD007092.pub2,wos,General & Internal Medicine,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007092.pub2)

The best ways to prevent or treat PSF are uncertain. Several different interventions can be argued to have a rational basis. Objectives To determine whether, among people with stroke, any intervention reduces the proportion of people with fatigue, fatigue severity, or both; and to determine the effect of intervention on health-related quality of life, disability, dependency and death, and whether such intervention is cost effective. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched May 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2014), EMBASE (1980 to May 2014), CINAHL (1982 to May 2014), AMED (1985 to May 2014), PsycINFO (1967 toMay 2014), Digital Dissertations (1861 toMay 2014), British Nursing Index (1985 toMay 2014), PEDro (searched May 2014) and PsycBITE (searched May 2014). We also searched four ongoing trials registries, scanned reference lists, performed citation tracking of included trials and contacted experts. Selection criteria Two review authors independently scrutinised all titles and abstracts and excluded obviously irrelevant studies. We obtained the full texts for potentially relevant studies and three review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an intervention with a control, or compared different interventions for PSF. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each included trial. The primary outcomes were severity of fatigue, or proportion of people with fatigue after treatment. We performed separate analyses for trials investigating efficacy in treating PSF, trials investigating efficacy in preventing PSF and trials not primarily investigating efficacy in PSF but which reported fatigue as an outcome. We pooled results from trials that had a control arm. For trials that compared different potentially active interventions without a control arm, we performed analyses for individual trials without pooling. We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) as the effect size for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We pooled the results using a random-effects model and assessed heterogeneity using the I-2 statistic. We performed separate subgroup analyses for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. We also performed sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of methodological quality. Main results We retrieved 12,490 citations, obtained full texts for 58 studies and included 12 trials (three from the 2008 search and nine from the 2014 search) with 703 participants. Eight trials primarily investigated the efficacy in treating PSF, of which six trials with seven comparisons provided data suitable for meta-analysis (five pharmacological interventions: fluoxetine, enerion, (-)-OSU6162, citicoline and a combination of Chinese herbs; and two non-pharmacological interventions: a fatigue education programme and a mindfulness-based stress reduction programme). The fatigue severity was lower in the intervention groups than in the control groups (244 participants, pooled SMD -1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.93 to -0.21), with significant heterogeneity between trials (I-2 = 87%, degrees of freedom (df) = 6, P value < 0.00001). The beneficial effect was not seen in trials that had used adequate allocation concealment (two trials, 89 participants, SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.04) or trials that had used adequate blinding of outcome assessors (four trials, 198 participants, SMD -1.10, 95% CI -2.31 to 0.11). No trial primarily investigated the efficacy in preventing PSF. Four trials (248 participants) did not primarily investigate the efficacy on fatigue but other symptoms after stroke. None of these interventions showed any benefit on reducing PSF, which included tirilazad mesylate, continuous positive airway pressure for sleep apnoea, antidepressants and a self management programme for recovery from chronic diseases. Authors' conclusions There was insufficient evidence on the efficacy of any intervention to treat or prevent fatigue after stroke. Trials to date have been small and heterogeneous, and some have had a high risk of bias. Some of the interventions described were feasible in people with stroke, but their efficacy should be investigated in RCTs with a more robust study design and adequate sample sizes.",10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3,wos,General & Internal Medicine,Fatigue [etiology; therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stroke [complications; psychology]; Female; Humans; Male,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3)
Interventions to Improve Patient Education Regarding Multifactorial Genetic Conditions: A Systematic Review,Not mental health,"Meilleur, KG; Littleton-Kearney, MT",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A,2009,"The careful education of patients with complex genetic disease is essential. However, healthcare providers often have limited time to spend providing thorough genetic education. Furthermore, the number of healthcare professionals possessing strong genetics training may be inadequate to meet increasing patient demands. Due to such constraints, several interventions have been investigated over the past decade to identify potential resources for the facilitation of this specific type of patient education. This systematic literature review of these interventions for patient education attempts to elucidate the answer to the question: is there sufficient evidence for best practice for delivering genetic information to patients with multifactorial conditions? The various interventions (CD-ROM, group counseling, video/decision aid, and miscellaneous) were analyzed in terms of quality criteria and achievement of specific outcomes and were rated according to the Stetler model for evidence-based practice. Seven main outcomes were evaluated: (1) objective and subjective knowledge assessment, (2) psychological measures (general anxiety, depression, stress, cancer worry), (3) satisfaction/effectiveness of intervention, (4) time spent in counseling (time spent on basic genetic information vs. specific concerns), (5) decision-making/intent to undergo genetic testing, (6) treatment choice and value of that choice, and, finally (7) risk perception. Overall, the computer interventions resulted in more significant findings that were beneficial than any other category followed by the video category, although the group and miscellaneous categories did not measure all of the outcomes reported by the other two categories. Nevertheless, while these groups had neutral or negative findings in some of the outcomes, the computer intervention group showed significant improvement in genetics knowledge, psychological measures, satisfaction/effectiveness, time spent with counselor, and decision/intent to undergo testing.

Intradialytic plantar electrical nerve stimulation to improve mobility and plantar sensation among adults with diabetes undergoing hemodialysis: a randomized double-blind trial,Not mental health,"Mishra, RK; Najafi, B; Hamad, A; Bara, R; Lee, MYG; Ibrahim, R; Mathew, M; Talal, T; Al-Ali, F",JOURNAL OF NEPHROLOGY,2023,"Background Impaired mobility is a debilitating consequence of hemodialysis. We examined the efficacy of intradialytic-plantar-electrical-nerve-stimulation (iPENS) to promote mobility among diabetes patients undergoing hemodialysis..Methods Adults with diabetes undergoing hemodialysis received either 1-h active iPENS, (Intervention-Group) or non-functional iPENS (Control-Group) during routine hemodialysis for 12 weeks (3 sessions/week). Participants and care-providers were blinded. Mobility (assessed using a validated pendant-sensor) and neuropathy (quantified by vibration-perception-threshold test) outcomes were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks.Results Among 77 enrolled subjects (56.2 & PLUSMN; 2.6 years old), 39 were randomly assigned to the intervention group, while 38 were assigned to the control group. No study-related adverse events and dropouts were reported in the intervention group. Compared to the control group, significant improvements with medium to large effect sizes were observed in the intervention group at 12 weeks for mobility-performance metrics, including active-behavior, sedentary-behavior, daily step counts, and sit-to-stand duration variability (p < 0.05), Cohen's d effect size (d = 0.63-0.84). The magnitude of improvement in active-behavior was correlated with improvement in the vibration-perception-threshold test in the intervention group (r = - 0.33, p = 0.048). A subgroup with severe-neuropathy (vibration-perception-threshold > 25 V) showed a significant reduction in plantar numbness at 12 weeks compared to baseline (p = 0.03, d = 1.1).Conclusions This study supports feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of iPENS to improve mobility and potentially reduce plantar numbness in people with diabetes undergoing hemodialysis. Considering that exercise programs are not widely used in hemodialysis clinical practice, iPENS may serve as a practical, alternative solution to reduce hemodialysis-acquired weakness and promote mobility.

This study examines whether communication within a smartphone-based application for addiction recovery produces distinct effects depending on 1) the level of communication, defined as intraindividual communication (e.g., journal entries to oneself); dyadic communication (e.g., private messaging to other individuals); or network communication (e.g., discussion forum posts to all group members), and 2) whether individuals produce or are exposed to messages. We operationalize these communication levels and behaviors based on system use logs as the number of clicks dedicated to each activity and assess how each category of system use relates to changes in group bonding and substance use after 6 months with the mobile intervention. Our findings show that (1) intraindividual exposure to one's own past posts marginally predicts decreased drug use; (2) dyadic production predicts greater perceived bonding; while dyadic exposure marginally predicts reduced drug use; (3) network production predicts decreased risky drinking.

Investigating Students' Computational Thinking Skills on Matter Module,Not mental health,"Lapawi, N; Husnin, H",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS,2020,"The revolution of the fourth industrial has impacted most aspect of our life and demanding a paradigm shift including education. It has become to our attention that there is a need to inculcate complex problem-solving skills among youth to equipped them to face the challenges in the era of digital technology. To fulfill the needs, computational thinking was introduced in school curriculum in Malaysia in 2017. It is still rather new, and this creates opportunity to understand how computational thinking can best be integrated in teaching and learning. In this study, we developed a module for a science topic, Matter and examine its impact on computational thinking skills on 65 students at secondary level. The computational thinking skills integrated in this study were abstraction, decomposition, algorithm, generalization, and evaluation. A quasi-experimental method was employed, and the ANCOVA result showed that there was no significant difference between control and treatment group on computational thinking skills. However, the score means for each of the computational thinking skills for both groups, showed that three skills in the treatment group were higher than the control group. The three computational thinking skills were decomposition, evaluation, and algorithm. This study suggested that CT involved mental process and proper planning is crucial to integrate computational thinking skills as teaching and learning is very contextual in nature.",NA,wos,Computer Science,Computational thinking skills; problem solving skill; teaching and learning; decomposition; evaluation; algorithm; science module; matter; secondary level students,URI::(https://www.doi.org/NA)

Methods: In fall 2020, n=231 university students were randomly assigned to an active control group (aCG, n=55, information only) or one of three intervention groups (IGs) receiving information plus different testimonials being presented either by nonacademic staff (IG1, n=60), university students (IG2, n=58) or experts (IG3, n=58). We assessed mediation effects of similarity and credibility on acceptance in terms of attitudes and usage intentions. Results: Exposure to testimonials was associated with higher usage intentions (d=0.50) and more positive attitudes toward digi-MHSs (d=0.32) compared to mere information (aCG). Regarding source-related effects, one-way ANOVA showed group differences in intentions ( ? p 2 =0.13) that were significantly higher after exposure to testimonials targeted at students than in the other groups after adjusting for baseline intentions ( ? p 2 =0.24). Concerning underlying mechanisms, there were full mediation effects of similarity (IG1 versus IG2) on attitudes [95%CI (0.030, 0.441)] and intentions to use digi-MHSs [95%CI (0.100, 0.528)] and of credibility on attitudes [IG2 versus IG3; 95%CI (-0.217, -0.004)], all favoring students' testimonials. Conclusion: Overall, this study indicates that the acceptance of digi-MHSs can be substantially increased by providing a simple, context-sensitive information intervention, including testimonials by university students.

Is India ready for mental health apps (MHApps)? A quantitative-qualitative exploration of caregivers' perspective on smartphone-based solutions for managing severe mental illnesses in low resource settings,Other,"Deb, K; Tuli, A; Sood, M; Chadda, R; Verma, R; Kumar, S; Ganesh, R; Singh, P",PLOS ONE,2018,"Background Mobile application based delivery of psycho-social interventions may help reduce the treatment gap for severe mental illnesses (SMIs) and decrease the burden on caregivers. Apps developed in high income settings show effectiveness, but they suffer from lack of applicability in low resource scenarios due to the difference in technology penetration, affordability, and acceptance. Objective This study aimed to understand health technology usage, perceived needs, and acceptability of app based interventions in patients with SMIs to improve illness management and reduce caregiver burden. Methods The study was conducted in inpatient and outpatient settings of a tertiary care center in North India. A cross-sectional survey assessed smartphone and health app usage. Further, three focus group discussions evaluated the needs and apprehensions in using apps in management of SMIs. Results A total of 176 participants including 88 patients and 88 caregivers completed the survey. Smartphone ownership was similar to the national average (30%) in both caregivers (38.6%) and in patients (31.8%). Although subjects regularly used a third party app, health app usage was very low. Cost, unfamiliarity, and language were significant barriers to adoption. The focus group discussions provided insight into the various apprehensions of caregivers in using and in allowing patients to use smartphones and such apps. Caregivers wanted mobile apps for accessing information regarding services and resources available for people with SMI, and they felt such apps can be helpful if they could automate some of their routine caregiving activities. However, the significant difficulty was perceived in regards to the cost of the device, language of the medium, and unfamiliarity in using technology. Apprehensions that SMI patients might misuse technology, or damage the device were also prevalent. Conclusions The study systematically looks into the scope, design considerations and limitations of implementing a mobile technology based intervention for low resource settings. With only one-third of the patients and caregivers having access to smartphones and internet, parallel outreach strategies like IVRS should be actively considered while designing interventions. The difficulty of understanding and searching in a non-native language needs to be addressed. Hand holding of caregivers and frequent encouragement from treating doctors might significantly help in technology adoption and in surmounting the apprehensions related to using technology. To make the solution acceptable and useful to the already overburdened caregivers, developers need to work closely with patients' family members and follow a ground-up collaborative approach to app development. The scope of delivering mental health services through technology is immense in resource constrained settings like India, provided we, researchers, appreciate and accept the fact that in the varied landscape of a divergent economic, educational, and cultural milieu, a single solution will never suffice for all, and intervention modality matching with end user capacity will be of paramount importance in determining the success of the endeavor.",10.1371/journal.pone.0203353,"pubmed, wos",Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203353)
Is Self-Help Dangerous? Examination of Adverse Effects of a Psychological Internet-Based Self-Help Intervention for Body-Focused Repetitive Behavior (Free From BFRB),Not Multi User,"Baumeister, A; Schmotz, S; Weidinger, S; Moritz, S",BEHAVIOR THERAPY,2024,"Despite the proven effectiveness of psychotherapy for psychiatric disorders, adverse events or unwanted effects may occur. Unwanted effects, however, are rarely assessed. In self-help interventions, which usually are not supported by a therapist, such effects have received even less attention even though special caution is needed regarding unwanted effects such as those related to misapplication. For the present study, we present the newly developed Positive and Negative Effects of Psychotherapy Scale for InternetBased Intervention (PANEPS-I) and examine possible unwanted effects of an internet-based self-help intervention in individuals with body -focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs), aggregating three different techniques: habit reversal training (HRT), decoupling (DC), and decoupling in sensu (DC -is). Some HRT users have expressed concern that the suppression of the problematic behavior could lead to rebound effects, but this has not been examined rigorously. Following baseline assessment, 141 participants with at least one BFRB were randomly assigned to two intervention groups that differed only with respect to the delivery mode (video, manual); the content was the same. After 6 weeks, a post -assessment was conducted. Unwanted effects were assessed using the PANEPS-I. A total of 70% of the participants (both treatment groups combined) reported at least one positive effect of the intervention. Negative effects were reported by 14-92% of par ticipants, depending on the effect. The highest agreement rates were found for no positive goal orientation (52.5%), did not address personal problems (48.8%), time/performance pressure (20.9%), shame (16.3%), and concerns about data privacy (14.3%). Participants in the manual intervention group reported unethical procedures (e.g., data privacy concerns) more often (Cohen's d = .44) than those in the video intervention group. Responders reported more positive effects and nonresponders more malpractice (|d| = .80, .54, respectively). HRT users (self -report) showed no significant differences compared to nonusers regarding negative effects. Stepwise hierarchical regression analyses indicated a dose -response relationship for reported positive effects and malpractice. Side effects may occur in any kind of intervention. Usage of HRT did not lead to more reported negative effects compared to nonusage. To improve the quality and effectiveness and ensure the safety of the user, especially those using digital self-help interventions, it is important to regularly assess unintended effects since there is no supervision of the patient in unguided self-help interventions.",10.1016/j.beth.2023.05.013,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Psychiatry,side effects; self-help; adverse events; body-focused repetitive behaviors; habit reversal training,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2023.05.013)

We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 23 Australian women diagnosed with gestational cancer in the preceding 5 years. Our findings depicted a group of women for whom cancer diagnosis and treatment had resulted in a sense of isolation and loneliness. Women reported seeking tailored information about their condition and treatments as well as one-on-one peer support with other gestational cancer survivors, which was challenging for them to access and which existing services struggled to provide. To address these unmet needs, innovative solutions may be necessary. Technology has the potential to connect and match women with one-to-one peer support, and research exploring the efficacy and acceptability of such interventions is required. Creative solutions, such as virtual resource hubs monitored or moderated by experts, would potentially meet the information needs of this group.

Although use of mobile technology in the form of mHealth interventions has proliferated recently in the field of health, published literature describing methods and processes of its application are limited. We present a set of methods and processes utilised to develop and pilot the Khuluma mHealth intervention amongst young people (15-20 years) in South Africa. We recruited and enrolled 52 adolescents (15-20-year olds) from four clinics in Pretoria and Cape Town to participate in a 6-month pilot of Khuluma.

Kind and Grateful: A Context-Sensitive Smartphone App Utilizing Inspirational Content to Promote Gratitude,Not Multi User,"Ghandeharioun, A; Azaria, A; Taylor, S; Picard, RW",PSYCHOLOGY OF WELL-BEING,2016,"Background: Previous research has shown that gratitude positively influences psychological wellbeing and physical health. Grateful people are reported to feel more optimistic and happy, to better mitigate aversive experiences, and to have stronger interpersonal bonds. Gratitude interventions have been shown to result in improved sleep, more frequent exercise and stronger cardiovascular and immune systems. These findings call for the development of technologies that would inspire gratitude. This paper presents a novel system designed toward this end. Methods: We leverage pervasive technologies to naturally embed inspiration to express gratitude in everyday life. Novel to this work, mobile sensor data is utilized to infer optimal moments for stimulating contextually relevant thankfulness and appreciation. Sporadic mood measurements are inventively obtained through the smartphone lock screen, investigating their interplay with grateful expressions. Both momentary thankful emotion and dispositional gratitude are measured. To evaluate our system, we ran two rounds of randomized control trials (RCT), including a pilot study (N = 15, 2 weeks) and a main study (N = 27, 5 weeks). Studies' participants were provided with a newly developed smartphone app through which they were asked to express gratitude; the app displayed inspirational content to only the intervention group, while measuring contextual cues for all users. Results: In both rounds of the RCT, the intervention was associated with improved thankful behavior. Significant increase was observed in multiple facets of practicing gratitude in the intervention groups. The average frequency of practicing thankfulness increased by more than 120 %, comparing the baseline weeks with the intervention weeks of the main study. In contrast, the control group of the same study exhibited a decrease of 90 % in the frequency of thankful expressions. In the course of the study's 5 weeks, increases in dispositional gratitude and in psychological wellbeing were also apparent. Analyzing the relation between mood and gratitude expressions, our data suggest that practicing gratitude increases the probability of going up in terms of emotional valence and down in terms of emotional arousal. The influences of inspirational content and contextual cues on promoting thankful behavior were also analyzed: We present data suggesting that the more successful times for eliciting expressions of gratitude tend to be shortly after a social experience, shortly after location change, and shortly after physical activity. Conclusions: The results support our intervention as an impactful method to promote grateful affect and behavior. Moreover, they provide insights into design and evaluation of general behavioral intervention technologies.",10.1186/s13612-016-0046-2,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,Gratitude; Inspiration; Trigger; Randomized control trial (RCT); Mood; Valence; Arousal; Contextual cue,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13612-016-0046-2)

Based on prior LG-OST protocols we explored feasibility and effectiveness of an LG-OST protocol in four cohorts of individuals highly fearful of heights (N = 104). Moreover, we aimed to identify predictors of LG-OST outcome in order to provide individualized treatment recommendations in the future. Methods Participants' fear of heights was assessed at pre- and post-treatment as well as at 5 months follow-up using questionnaires and a behavioral approach test (BAT). Pre-treatment indices of negative emotional traits and positive mental health, the extent by which fear-evoking expectancies were violated during exposure, and post-treatment group perception processes were assessed in order to predict the outcome. Results The LG-OST procedure proved feasible and effective in terms of both subjective and behavioral fear of heights. Post-treatment effects sizes of questionnaires assessing fear of heights ranged between d = 0.94 - 1.43. After the treatment, about half of the participants (49.5%) were able to ascend an aerial fire ladder up to a maximum of 30 m (vs. pre-treatment 17.3%). Follow up results showed the long-term stability of effects. Among psychological constructs, positive mental health and expectancy violation were the strongest predictors of LG-OST long-term outcome. Conclusion We conclude that exposure based LG-OSTs are feasible, effective and very efficient compared to individual face-to-face settings. Thus, they represent very promising treatment alternatives for situational fears including fear of heights.

Layperson-Facilitated Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Homebound Older Adults With Depression: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Other,"Kayser, J; Wang, X; Wu, ZK; Dimoji, A; Xiang, XL",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2023,"Background: Depression in older adults has serious biological, psychological, and social consequences. Homebound older adults experience a high burden of depression and significant barriers to accessing mental health treatments. Few interventions to address their specific needs have been developed. Existing treatment modalities can be challenging to scale up, are not tailored to unique population concerns, and require significant staffing support. Technology-assisted, layperson-facilitated psychotherapy has the potential to overcome these challenges.Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a layperson-facilitated internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program tailored for homebound older adults. The novel intervention, Empower@Home, was developed based on user-centered design principles and partnerships between researchers, social service agencies, care recipients, and other stakeholders serving low-income homebound older adults.Methods: This 2-arm, 20-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a waitlist control crossover design aims to enroll 70 community-dwelling older adults with elevated depressive symptoms. The treatment group will receive the 10-week intervention immediately, whereas the waitlist control group will cross over and receive the intervention after 10 weeks. This pilot is part of a multiphase project involving a single-group feasibility study (completed in December 2022). This project consists of a pilot RCT (described in this protocol) and an implementation feasibility study running in parallel with the pilot RCT. The primary clinical outcome of the pilot is the change in depressive symptoms after the intervention and at the 20-week postrandomization follow-up. Additional outcomes include acceptability, adherence, and changes in anxiety, social isolation, and quality of life.Results: Institutional review board approval was obtained for the proposed trial in April 2022. Recruitment for the pilot RCT began in January 2023 and is anticipated to end in September 2023. On completion of the pilot trial, we will examine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention on depression symptoms and other secondary clinical outcomes in an intention-to-treat analysis. Conclusions: Although web-based cognitive behavioral therapy programs are available, most programs have low adherence and very few are tailored for older adults. Our intervention addresses this gap. Older adults, particularly those with mobility difficulties and multiple chronic health conditions, could benefit from internet-based psychotherapy. This approach can serve a pressing need in society while being cost-effective, scalable, and convenient.

"Layperson-Supported, Web-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression in Older Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial",Good,"Xiang, XL; Kayser, J; Turner, S; Ash, S; Himle, JA",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2024,"Background: Depression is the most prevalent mental health condition in older adults. However, not all evidence-based treatments are easily accessible. Web-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (wCBT) facilitated by laypersons is a viable treatment alternative. Objective: This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel wCBT program, Empower@Home, supported by trained lay coaches, against a waitlist attention control. Empower@Home is among the very few existing wCBT programs specifically designed for older adults. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of the intervention compared with attention control. The secondary objective was to evaluate the program's impact on secondary psychosocial outcomes and explore potential change mechanisms. Methods: Older adults (N=70) were recruited via web-based research registries, social media advertisements, and community agency referrals and randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention group received access to Empower@Home, which included 9 web-delivered self-help lessons and weekly telephone coaching sessions by a trained layperson over 10 weeks. The control group received weekly friendly phone calls and depressive symptom monitoring. The primary clinical outcome was the severity of depressive symptoms assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The secondary clinical outcomes included anxiety, anger, social isolation, insomnia, pain intensity, and quality of life. Linear mixed modeling was used to determine the treatment effects on depression, and 2-tailed t tests were used to assess within-group changes and between-group differences. Results: Most participants in the intervention group completed all 9 sessions (31/35, 89%). The usability and acceptability ratings were excellent. The intervention group had a large within-group change in depressive symptoms (Cohen d=1.22; P<.001), whereas the attention control group experienced a medium change (Cohen d=0.57; P<.001). The between-group effect size was significant, favoring the intervention group over the control group (Cohen d=0.72; P<.001). In the linear mixed model, the group-by-time interaction was statistically significant (b=-0.68, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.35; P<.001). The treatment effects were mediated by improvements in cognitive behavioral therapy skills acquisition; behavioral activation; and satisfaction with the basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Furthermore, the intervention group showed significant within-group improvements in secondary psychosocial outcomes, including anxiety (P=.001), anger (P<.001), social isolation (P=.02), insomnia (P=.007), and pain (P=.03). By contrast, the control group did not experience significant changes in these outcome domains. However, the between-group differences in secondary outcomes were not statistically significant, owing to Conclusions: Empower@Home, a wCBT program supported by lay coaches, was more efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms than friendly telephone calls and depression symptom monitoring.

Learning from Adolescents and Caregivers to Enhance Acceptability and Engagement Within Virtual Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents Skills Groups: A Qualitative Study,Good,"Conroy, K; Kehrer, SM; Georgiadis, C; Hare, M; Ringle, VM; Shaw, AM",CHILD PSYCHIATRY & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,2024,"Despite the significant increase in adolescent mental health challenges in recent years, structural barriers continue to limit access to and engagement in mental health services. As such, opportunities to learn directly from adolescents and their families on how to best structure and deliver services are paramount. The current study assumes a multi-informant approach and reports on adolescents' and caregivers' (N = 33) experiences in an adapted telehealth/hybrid Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents (DBT-A) program. Focus groups were conducted across two cohorts of families who participated in DBT-A skills groups, to collect family-centered data on the acceptability of program modifications, engagement in the adapted telehealth/hybrid DBT-A, and recommendations for improvement. Participants were predominately Latine White and were from a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, 45.5% of the adolescents identified as LGBTQ + . Focus group findings emphasized how the telehealth platform was both convenient and disengaging, and how in-person sessions offered improved group connection and content engagement. Participants underscored the importance of balancing multi-family group sessions with adolescent- and caregiver-only group sessions in the program, and adolescents emphasized a need for the DBT-A program to better center adolescents' unique experiences and voices throughout sessions. Both adolescents and caregivers suggested modifications to synthesize the content and improve generalizability of the DBT-A skills to their real lives. Overall, these findings add to a new and evolving branch of DBT-A qualitative inquiry, as well as the growing body of work that recommends incorporating the voices of people with lived experiences into the development and modification of psychological services.",10.1007/s10578-023-01641-7,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Pediatrics; Psychiatry,Dialectical behavior therapy for adolescents; Qualitative methods; Treatment acceptability; Telehealth and hybrid group therapy; Patient-centered program feedback,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10578-023-01641-7)

"Lessons Learned From an Effectiveness Evaluation of Inlife, a Web-Based Social Support Intervention for Caregivers of People With Dementia: Randomized Controlled Trial",Good,"Christie, HL; Dam, AEH; van Boxtel, M; Köhler, S; Verhey, F; de Vugt, ME",JMIR AGING,2022,"Background: Informal care for people with dementia not only affects the well-being of the primary caregiver but also changes their roles and interactions with the social environment. New online interventions might facilitate access to social support. Recently, an online social support platform, Inlife, was developed in the Netherlands and aims to enhance social support and positive interactions in informal support networks.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Inlife for caregivers of people with dementia. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with 96 caregivers of people with dementia was performed. Participants were randomly assigned to the Inlife intervention or the waiting list control group. After 16 weeks of Inlife use, the waiting list control group could start using Inlife. Effects were evaluated at baseline (T0), 8 weeks (T1), and 16 weeks (T2). The 16-week follow-up assessment (T2) served as the primary endpoint to evaluate the results for the primary and secondary outcome variables evaluated with online self-report questionnaires. The primary outcomes included feelings of caregiver competence and perceived social support. The secondary outcomes included received support, feelings of loneliness, psychological complaints (eg, anxiety, stress), and quality of life.Results: No significant improvements were demonstrated for the intervention group (n=48) relative to the control group (n=48) for the primary outcomes (feeling of carer competence: b=-0.057, 95% CI -0.715 to 0.602, P=.87; perceived social support: b=-15.877, 95% CI -78.284 to 46.530, P=.62) or any secondary outcome. This contrasts with our qualitative findings showing the potential of Inlife to facilitate the care process in daily life. Adherence was not optimal for all Inlife users. Additional per-protocol and sensitivity analyses also revealed no beneficial results for high active Inlife users or specific subgroups. Inlife users were more active when part of a larger network. Conclusions: Researchers should be modest regarding the effectiveness of online caregiver interventions in terms of quantitative measures of well-being and quality of life. Nevertheless, online tools have the potential to facilitate the caregiver process in daily life. Lessons learned include the importance of harnessing the power of human interaction in eHealth, making use of the user's social capital, and the need to develop research methods that can identify benefits in daily life that are ecologically valid for Trial Registration: Netherlands Trial Register NTR6131; https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=NTR6131",10.1186/s13063-017-2097-y,wos,Geriatrics & Gerontology; Medical Informatics,dementia; Alzheimer's; neurodegenerative; caregiver; caregiving; digital health; eHealth; mHealth; Information communication; peer -support; informal support; social interaction; support network,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-017-2097-y)

Our research collaborative, consisting of 5 research teams in the U.S. and Australia, aimed to address this gap. We collaborated to share lessons learned from our experiences recruiting and retaining pregnant and postpartum individuals in digital trials of social and behavioral interventions. We first discuss the promise of digital trials in improving participation in research during the perinatal period, as well as the unique challenges they pose. Second, we present lessons learned from 12 completed and ongoing digital trials that have used platforms such as Ovia, Facebook, and Instagram for recruitment. Our trials evaluated interventions for breastfeeding, prenatal and postpartum depression, insomnia, decision making, and chronic pain. We focus on challenges and lessons learned in 3 key areas: (1) rapid recruitment of large samples with a diversity of minoritized identities, (2) retention of study participants in longitudinal studies, and (3) prevention of fraudulent enrollment.

However, in this young field, there is little consensus to guide the process of engaging in the development and evaluation of targeted VR-based interventions. Objective: The INOVATE-Pain (Interdisciplinary Network on Virtual and Augmented Technologies for Pain management) consortium aims to advance the field of VR for pediatric chronic pain rehabilitation by providing guidance for best practices in the design, evaluation, and dissemination of VR-based interventions targeting this population. Methods: An interdisciplinary meeting of 16 academics, clinicians, industry partners, and philanthropy partners was held in January 2020. Results: Reviewing the state of the field, the consortium identified important directions for research-driven innovation in VR and AR clinical care, highlighted key opportunities and challenges facing the field, and established a consensus on best methodological practices to adopt in future efforts to advance the research and practice of VR and AR in pediatric pain. The consortium also identified important next steps to undertake to continue to advance the work in this promising new area of digital health pain interventions. Conclusions: To realize the promise of this realm of innovation, key ingredients for success include productive partnerships among industry, academic, and clinical stakeholders; a uniform set of outcome domains and measures for standardized evaluation; and widespread access to the latest opportunities, tools, and resources.

Leveraging technology in field education for digital natives: Using goal attainment scaling,Not mental health,"Harrison, J; Chapleau, A; Schell, M; Vaughan, V; Colzin, C",SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION,2020,"In 21(st) century social work education, faculty must build on student experiences to construct new learning opportunities. However, traditional academic approaches often struggle with this. One barrier is the lack of tools to facilitate assessment of learning and responsiveness to performance with proximal feedback. Education during field placement can be an added challenge as students are learning to apply knowledge, grappling with real life challenges, while geographically dispersed. Individualized goal setting and measurement is needed to engage today's learners and teachers in the process of knowledge, skill, and value development.This program incorporated technology to improve a collaborative outcome measure, Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS). This tool was then trialed in various interprofessional field settings to determine the utility and response. In an interprofessional training program for social work andoccupational therapy students, and peer supports, each student created and scaled both professional and personal development goals. GAS enabled measurement of incremental change over time in students' personal and professional development goals they had created for themselves. GAS professional goals (mean diff. = 2.41(1.09), t = 11.97(28)) and personal goals (mean diff. = 2.76 (1.09), t = 13.62(28)) both improved significantly (p < .01).

Life story books for people with dementia: a systematic review,Not Multi User,"Elfrink, TR; Zuidema, SU; Kunz, M; Westerhof, GJ",INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS,2018,"Objectives: There is an increasing evidence that reminiscence therapy is effective in improving cognitive functions and reducing depressive symptoms in people with dementia. Life story books (LSBs) are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories. As little is known about how LSBs are used and what type of studies have been employed to evaluate LSB interventions, we conducted a systematic review. Methods: The electronic databases Scopus, PubMed, and PsychINFO as well as reference lists of existing studies were searched to select eligible articles. Out of the 55 studies found, 14 met the inclusion criterion of an original empirical study on LSBs in people with dementia. Results: The majority of the LSBs were tangible books, although some digital applications were also found. The LSBs were created mostly in individual sessions in nursing homes with a median of six sessions. Some studies only focused on the person with dementia, while others also examined (in)formal caregivers. Most studies used qualitative interviews, case studies, and/or (pilot) randomized controlled trial (RCTs) with small sample sizes. Qualitative findings showed the value of LSBs in triggering memories and in improving the relation with the person with dementia. Quantitative effects were found on, e.g. autobiographical memory and depression of persons with dementia, quality of relationship with informal caregivers, burden of informal caregivers, and on attitudes and knowledge of formal caregivers. Conclusions: This systematic review confirms that the use of LSBs to support reminiscence and person-centered care is promising, but larger RCTs or implementation studies are needed to establish the effects of LSBs on people with dementia.",10.1017/S1041610218000376,wos,Psychology; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Psychiatry,life story book; reminiscence; dementia; systematic review; person-centered care; caregivers,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1017/S1041610218000376)

Since there is no consensus in the literature about its efficacy and how it should be processed, this study aims to evaluate the light therapy effectiveness in the delayed sleep-wake phase disorder therapeutics. A systematic review was conducted using the MEDLINE/PubMed, Virtual Health Library Brazil, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus databases along with a hand search until September 2020. The included studies presented participants diagnosed with insomnia or DSWPD, over 18-years old, treated only with morning light therapy, mentioning the light intensity (lux) used, and investigations with a control group.

Objective: This study investigated the efficacy of liposomal anesthetic gel for pain control during periodontal therapy. Methodology: Forty volunteers with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis were recruited, of which at least three sextants required periodontal therapy. At least one of the selected teeth had one site with a probing depth of >= 4 mm. The volunteers received the following three gels: a placebo, lidocaine/prilocaine (Oraqix (R)), or a liposomal lidocaine/prilocaine, which were applied to different sextants. Pain frequency was registered during treatment and the volunteers received a digital counter to register any painful or uncomfortable experiences. At the end of each session, the volunteers indicated their pain intensity using rating scales (NRS-101 and VRS-4). The volunteers had their hemodynamic parameters measured by a non-invasive digital monitor. Results: Pain frequency/intensity did not show statistical difference between intervention groups. The tested gels did not interfere with the hemodynamic indices. Dental anxiety, suppuration and probing depth could influence pain during periodontal therapy.

DESIGN: Randomized trial of stepped collaborative care intervention versus usual care. SETTING: HMO in Seattle, Wash. PATIENTS: Patients with major depression were stratified into severe and moderate depression groups prior to randomization. INTERVENTIONS: A multifaceted intervention targeting patient, physician, and process of care, using collaborative management by a psychiatrist and a primary care physician. MEASURES AND MAIN RESUTLS: The collaborative care intervention was associated with continued improvement in depressive symptoms at 28 months in patients in the moderate-severity group (F-1,F-87 = 8.65; P = .004), but not in patients in the high-severity group (F-1,F-51 = 0.02; P = .88) Improvements in the intervention group in antidepressant adherence were found to occur for the first 6 months (chi(2) (1) = 8.23; P < .01) and second 6-month period (chi(2) (1) = 5.98; P < .05) after randomization in the high-severity group and for 6 months after randomization in the moderate-severity group(chi(2) (1) = 6.10; P < .05). There were no significant differences in total ambulatory costs between intervention and control patients over the 28-month period (F-1,F-180 = 0.77; P = .40).

Longitudinal Effects of Computer-Mediated Communication Anxiety on Interaction in Virtual Teams,Not mental health,"Fuller, RM; Vician, CM; Brown, SA",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION,2016,"Research problem: Organizations continue to rely upon virtual teams, yet knowing how, and for how long, individual members' computer-mediated communication (CMC) anxiety affects virtual team interactions and performance outcomes is not well-known. Research questions: (1) What is the relationship between CMC anxiety and virtual team participation? (2) How does this relationship influence the perceptions of individual performance? (3) Does this relationship persist over time? Literature review: A literature review including communication and media structures, input-mediator-output team effectiveness, and individual CMC anxiety elements indicate researchable negative effects upon virtual team interaction and participation in CMC environments. Higher levels of individual CMC anxiety could dampen participation quantity, participation type (task versus social), participation quality, and perceptions of individual performance. Further, the initial negative interactions and behaviors could persist over time. Methodology: This quantitative quasiexperimental study involved surveying, observing, and coding the interactions of 22 virtual project teams (consisting of a total of 110 individuals) over a span of four months. The teams used a CMC tool with shared file space and discussion boards to coordinate database design and implementation work. Data were collected from questionnaire surveys, individual message postings, and team project scores. Individual message postings were coded to measure participation quality (task focus and topic introductions) and participation quantity (message count and words per message). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures multivariate analyses along with follow-up univariate statistical testing. Results and conclusions: The results indicate that individuals with higher levels of CMC anxiety participated less, sent fewer task-oriented messages, introduced fewer novel topics, and were rated more poorly by team members on their performance compared to individuals with lower levels of CMC anxiety. The results also show that CMC-anxious individuals do send relatively more social-oriented messages, perhaps to compensate for typical apprehensive communication behaviors in a virtual team environment. In addition, participation quality and quantity and perceptions of performance by CMC-anxious team members do not significantly improve, even with repeated interactions over CMC. Although study participants evidenced high engagement with the project tasks, the study is limited by its use of student subjects. The study suggests the importance of team leaders and role definitions for virtual teams, to counteract potential unintended effects of CMC technology use masking actual participation and contribution of virtual team members. Future research could investigate the efficacy of interventions for reducing the negative impacts of CMC anxiety in virtual team performance, as well as the influence of individual structures such as CMC anxiety in the use of CMC and team structures in the virtual team environment.",10.1109/TPC.2016.2583318,wos,Communication; Engineering,Anxiety; communication apprehension; computer-mediated communication; CMC anxiety; evaluation; longitudinal; media synchronicity theory (MST); performance; virtual teams,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1109/TPC.2016.2583318)
Lost in the matrix: Dialectical tensions in facilitating virtual video groups during COVID-19 pandemic,Good,"Ben-David, Y; Ickeson, T; Kaye-Tzadok, A",INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH,2021,"The research phenomenologically explored the experience of facilitating virtual video groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research questions addressed relational processes in virtual video groups, including emotional presence, interpersonal communication, and intimacy. Specifically, we asked how facilitators can intervene effectively to promote these processes in the virtual space, within the context of social distancing. Semi-structured group interviews were held with 26 female group facilitators from various professional backgrounds during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel in May 2020. Phenomenological analysis yielded five main themes addressing dialectical tensions that operate simultaneously in the virtual space, both enabling and hindering relational processes in virtual video groups: intimacy and intrusion in the domestic space; sharp transitions from presence to absence; fragmented processing despite abundant information; sterility and clarity in group communication; and the hyper-aware self - being a participant and an observer at the same time. Moving groups into a virtual sphere challenged the traditional role of facilitators, who struggled to create a safe space in an unstable virtual setting where the boundaries between personal and professional lives were reduced. Findings also point to the potential of the domestic space to promote closeness and intimacy and suggest the virtual space requires facilitators to embrace multiplicity as a state of mind when intervening. Facilitators must work with permeable boundaries between inner and outer group spaces, accept discontinuity as a basic property of the virtual, and acknowledge the limitations caused by multiple stimuli.",10.1016/j.invent.2021.100445,wos,Psychology; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Psychiatry,Virtual group intervention; COVID-19; Group facilitation; Discontinuity; Phenomenology,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100445)

Material and Method: A total of 128 (111 female, 17 male) patients in study group, and 347 (312 female, 35 male) who didn't have any endocrinologic-metabolic or psychiatric disorders and were not on any drug treatment in control group were evaluated. At the beginning, antropometric measuremnts, body composition analysis with a bioelectrical impedance analyzer and blood samples for some biochemical tests (Fasting blood glucose, insulin, HbA1C, triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL blood counting, vitamin B12, folate, zinc, CRP, homocystein, cortisol,fibrinogen, TSH, uric acid levels) were taken for all patients. Results were analyzed statistically by using a computer program SPSS for Windows 10.0 with Mann Whitney U, pearson corelation, multipl regression analysis and Student t tests. Results: Mean treatment length with psychiatric drugs of the patients was 5.29+/-5.99 year, and mean weight gain at this period was 12.05+/-6.80 kg. Most of the patients have been taking more than one type of psychiatric drugs and their distrubition were 71.9% antidepressants, 31.3% anti-psychotics, 25.0% mood stabilyzers and 10.9% anxyolitics. Mean weight gain, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences, and body,fat percent of patients in study group were higher than in control group. Also while blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, TSH,fibrinogen levels were statistically higher; total protein, albumin, zinc and folat levels were find statistically lower in study group. When all participants in both of the groups were divided as normal weight, owerweight and obese according to BA,11, it was found that while BMI increasing waist and hip circum-ferences, body fat percent, blood insulin, HbA1C levels increased but HDL levels decreased significantly. In study group, treatment period corelated positifly with body fat percent, blood insulin, TSH and homocystein levels; but corelated negatively with albumin level. Weight gain corelated positively with waist and hip circumfernces, body fat percent, blood insulin, trigliseride and TSH levels; but corelated negatively with folat level in patients taking psychiatric drugs. Conclusion: According to results of this study, it was shown that patients treated with psychiatric drugs are sensitive to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases along with obesity. So, it was though that patients who need psychiatric pharmacotherapies may have benefit if evaluated and treated by a team consisting endocrinologic, metabolic and nutritional specialists.

Management of comorbid mental and somatic disorders in stepped care approaches in primary care: a systematic review,Not Digital,"Maehder, K; Löwe, B; Härter, M; Heddaeus, D; Scherer, M; Weigel, A",FAMILY PRACTICE,2019,"Background Stepped care models comprise a graded treatment intensity and a systematic monitoring. For an effective implementation, stepped care models have to account for the high rates of mental and somatic comorbidity in primary care. Objectives The aim of the systematic review was to take stock of whether present stepped care models take comorbidities into consideration. A further aim was to give an overview on treatment components and involved health care professionals. Methods A systematic literature search was performed using the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Selection criteria were a randomized controlled trial of a primary-care-based stepped care intervention, adult samples, publication between 2000 and 2017 and English or German language. Results Of 1009 search results, 39 studies were eligible. One-third of the trials were conceived for depressive disorders only, one-third for depression and further somatic and/or mental comorbidity and one-third for conditions other than depression. In 39% of the studies comorbidities were explicitly integrated in treatment, mainly via transdiagnostic self-management support, interprofessional collaboration and digital approaches for treatment, monitoring and communication. Most care teams were composed of a primary care physician, a care manager and a psychiatrist and/or psychologist. Due to the heterogeneity of the addressed disorders, no meta-analysis was performed. Conclusions Several stepped care models in primary care already account for comorbidities, with depression being the predominant target disorder. To determine their efficacy, the identified strategies to account for comorbidities should be investigated within stepped care models for a broader range of disorders.",10.1093/fampra/cmy122,wos,General & Internal Medicine,Collaborative care; comorbidity; mental health care; primary health care; stepped care; telemedicine,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmy122)

Workplace interventions aimed at supporting employers in the prevention of mental ill-health in the workforce are urgently required. Managing Minds at Work is a digital intervention aimed at supporting line managers in promoting better mental health at work through a preventative approach. This intervention was developed as part of the Mental Health and Productivity Pilot, a wider initiative aimed at supporting employers across the Midlands region of the United Kingdom to improve the future of workplace mental health and wellbeing. The aim of the study is to describe the design and development of the Managing Minds at Work digital training program, prior to feasibility testing. We adopted a collaborative participatory design involving co-design (users as partners) and principles of user-centred design (pilot and usability testing). An agile methodology was used to co-create intervention content with a stakeholder virtual community of practice. Development processes were mapped to core elements of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions. The program covers five broad areas: (i) promoting self-care techniques among line managers; (ii) designing work to prevent work-related stress; (iii) management competencies to prevent and reduce stress; (iv) having conversations with employees about mental health; (v) building a psychologically safe work environment. It was considered by stakeholders to be appropriate for any type of organization, irrespective of their size or resources. Pilot and usability testing (n = 37 surveys) aligned with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) demonstrated that the program was perceived to be useful, relevant, and easy to use by managers across sectors, organization types, and sizes.

However, testing these interventions in LMICs can be challenging due to limited resources. The use of electronic data collection via smartphones can be an alternative and ideal low-cost method to measure outcomes in an environment with adverse conditions. Objective: Our study had two objectives: to test the efficacy of a nurse home visiting intervention on maternal parenting and well-being measured by an electronic daily diary (eDiary), and to investigate the compliance rate of the eDiary measurement method. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of Primeiros Lagos, a nurse home visiting program, for adolescent mothers living in an urban deprived area of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A total of 169 pregnant adolescents were assessed for eligibility criteria, 80 of whom were included and randomized to the intervention (n=40) and control group (care as usual, n=40). Primeiros Lagos is a home visiting intervention delivered by trained nurses tailored to first-time pregnant adolescents and their children, starting during the first 16 weeks of pregnancy until the child reaches 24 months of age. Participants were assessed by blind interviewers at 8-16 weeks of pregnancy (baseline), 30 weeks of pregnancy, and when the child was 3, 6, and 12 months of age. At 18 months, participants were assessed regarding maternal parenting and parental well-being using a 7-consecutive-thy eDiary. The smartphone app was programmed to notify participants every day at 9:00 PM over a period of seven days. Results: We were able to contact 57/80 (71%) participants (29 from the intervention group and 28 from the control group) when the child was 18 months of age. Forty-eight of the 57 participants (84%) completed at least one day of the eDiary protocol. The daily compliance rate ranged from 49% to 70%. Our analyses showed a significant effect of the intervention on parental well-being (B=0.32, 95% CI [0.06, 0.58], P=.02) and the maternal parenting behavior of the mother telling a story or singing to the child (odds ratio=2.33, 95% CI [1.20, 4.50], P=.01).Our analyses showed a significant effect of the intervention on parental well-being (B=0.32, P=.02) and the maternal parenting behavior of the mother telling a story or singing to the child (odds ratio=2.33, P=.01). Conclusions: The Primeiros Lagos intervention improved maternal parenting and parental well-being, demonstrating its promise for low-income adolescent mothers.

Measuring patient experiences in a Children's hospital with a medical clowning intervention: a case-control study,Other,"Karisalmi, N; Mäenpää, K; Kaipio, J; Lahdenne, P",BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,2020,"BackgroundBecause the healthcare sector is shifting to a customer-oriented approach, it is important to understand experiences of children as users of healthcare services. So far, studies that measure the influence of medical clowning on patient experiences are scarce. This study aims to measure experiences of children and their parents during day-surgery in hospital setting.MethodsA case-control study was conducted in a large Finnish children's hospital. Seventy children aged 4-17years coming for a minor operative procedure including pre-operative cannula insertion prior to surgery were included. Thirty-eight children were exposed to the medical clowning intervention and 32 children (the reference group) did not receive exposure to medical clowning. A novel digital survey tool was used to measure patient experiences before and after the insertion of a venous cannula needed for anaesthesia. The children were asked about their emotions, anxiety levels, the pain from the cannula insertion and the best and worst things about the hospital. The parents were asked about their emotions, expectations and the fluency of the procedure and the hospital day.ResultsBefore the procedure, 32% or 36% of the children in the intervention group and 44% or 28% of those in the reference group expressed positive or neutral emotions, respectively. After the procedure, 76% or 63% of children in the intervention group or reference group, respectively, expressed positive emotions. The intervention group rated the medical clowns as the best aspect of the hospital day. Both groups reported that the best aspects of the hospital day were related to the nurses and food and the worst were related to waiting and pain. Most commonly the parents felt uncertainty, anxiety or calmness before the procedure and relief afterwards. Their expectations towards the procedure related to its success and the certainty of the diagnosis.ConclusionsThe results show a trend towards more positive emotions in children with exposure to medical clowning.

Here, we explored whether five theoretically derived intervening variables (i.e., pain intensity, pain-related disability, pain self-efficacy, quality of life [QoL], and work capacity) were mediating the effectiveness of a digital intervention specifically designed to prevent depression in patients with chronic back pain (CBP). Method: This study is a secondary analysis of a pragmatic, observer-masked randomized clinical trial conducted at 82 orthopedic clinics in Germany.

Medical Internet of Things and Big Data in Healthcare,Good,"Dimitrov, DV",HEALTHCARE INFORMATICS RESEARCH,2016,"Objectives: A number of technologies can reduce overall costs for the prevention or management of chronic illnesses. These include devices that constantly monitor health indicators, devices that auto-administer therapies, or devices that track real-time health data when a patient self-administers a therapy. Because they have increased access to high-speed Internet and smartphones, many patients have started to use mobile applications (apps) to manage various health needs. These devices and mobile apps are now increasingly used and integrated with telemedicine and telehealth via the medical Internet of Things (mIoT). This paper reviews mIoT and big data in healthcare fields. Methods: mIoT is a critical piece of the digital transformation of healthcare, as it allows new business models to emerge and enables changes in work processes, productivity improvements, cost containment and enhanced customer experiences. Results: Wearables and mobile apps today support fitness, health education, symptom tracking, and collaborative disease management and care coordination. All those platform analytics can raise the relevancy of data interpretations, reducing the amount of time that end users spend piecing together data outputs. Insights gained from big data analysis will drive the digital disruption of the healthcare world, business processes and real-time decision-making. Conclusions: A new category of personalised preventative health coaches (Digital Health Advisors) will emerge.

The disorder has early onset and is characterized by a combination of overactive, poorly modulated behavior with marked inattention. In the long term it can impair academic performance, vocational success and social-emotional development. Meditation is increasingly used for psychological conditions and could be used as a tool for attentional training in the ADHD population. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of meditation therapies as a treatment for ADHD. Search strategy Our extensive search included: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, C2-SPECTR, dissertation abstracts, LILACS, Virtual Health Library (VHL) in BIREME, Complementary and Alternative Medicine specific databases, HSTAT, Informit, JST, Thai Psychiatric databases and ISI Proceedings, plus grey literature and trial registries from inception to January 2010. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of meditation therapy in children or adults diagnosed with ADHD. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data independently using a pre-designed data extraction form. We contacted study authors for additional information required. We analyzed data using mean difference (MD) to calculate the treatment effect. The results are presented in tables, figures and narrative form. Main results Four studies, including 83 participants, are included in this review. Two studies used mantra meditation while the other two used yoga compared with drugs, relaxation training, non-specific exercises and standard treatment control. Design limitations caused high risk of bias across the studies. Only one out of four studies provided data appropriate for analysis. For this study there was no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the drug therapy group on the teacher rating ADHD scale (MD-2.72, 95% CI -8.49 to 3.05, 15 patients). Likewise, there was no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the standard therapy group on the teacher rating ADHD scale (MD -0.52, 95% CI -5.88 to 4.84, 17 patients).

Mental Health Disorder Identification From Motivational Conversations,Not Digital,"Saha, T; Reddy, SM; Saha, S; Bhattacharyya, P",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS,2023,"Mental health disorder continues to be a grievous concern plaguing humans worldwide. The scarcity of mental health professionals (MHPs) has driven novel efforts lately to combat mental illness by developing automated systems capable of assisting MHPs. However, lack of high-quality conversational data due to privacy concerns remains a bottleneck toward its study and automation. Also, distinguishing and identifying various mental disorders is a challenging task as these are expressed using similar patterns in terms of language usage and overall sentiment polarity. The need for classifying different mental illnesses is rather intuitive as their true diagnosis is imperative for determining their path to recovery. As a first step toward creating automated virtual agent (VA), in this article, we curate a large-scale dataset for multiple mental illnesses comprising of dyadic conversations between a mentally ill user (typically a support seeker) and the VA (typically a peer supporter imparting hope and motivation), collected from a peer-to-peer support platform. We present a hierarchical attention-based deep neural network classifier for modeling conversations to detect different mental disorders as the dialog progresses. The proposed network is equipped with lexicon-based sentiment scores in order to prioritize certain contributing features. The proposed model attained an accuracy of 83.91% and outperformed several strong baselines.",10.1109/TCSS.2022.3143763,wos,Computer Science,Mental health; Social networking (online); Depression; Task analysis; Medical treatment; Anxiety disorders; Media; Classification; dialog; mental health disorder; seeker; supporter; virtual agent (VA),URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1109/TCSS.2022.3143763)
Mental Health Promotion Among University Students Using Text Messaging: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial of a Mobile Phone-Based Intervention,Not Multi User,"Thomas, K; Bendtsen, M",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2019,"Background: There is a growing understanding that well-being and mental illness are 2 separate dimensions of mental health. High well-being is associated with decreased risk of disease and mental illness and increased longevity. Objective: This study aims to test the efficacy of a mobile phone-based intervention on positive mental health. Methods: We are conducting a 2-armed randomized controlled trial of university students in Sweden. Recruitment will last for 6 months by digital advertising (eg, university websites). Participants will be randomly allocated to either an intervention (fully automated mobile phone-based mental health intervention) or control group (treatment as usual). The primary outcome will be self-assessed positive mental health (Mental Health Continuum Short Form). Secondary outcomes will be self-assessed depression anxiety symptomatology (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale). Outcomes will be investigated at baseline, at 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization. Mediators (positive emotions and thoughts) will be investigated at baseline, midintervention, and at follow-ups using 2 single face-valid items. Results: Data will be collected between autumn 2018 and spring 2019. Results are expected to be published in 2020.

Mental Health Stigma Reduction in the Midwestern United States: Evidence from a Digital Campaign Using a Collective Impact Model,Other,"Diouf, F; Lemley, B; Barth, C; Goldbarg, J; Helgenberger, S; Grimm, B; Wartella, E; Smyser, J; Bonnevie, E",JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH,2022,"Addressing mental stigma is a key component of improving mental health outcomes. A digital media campaign was implemented to reduce mental health stigma in the Omaha Metropolitan area. The campaign used evidence-based approaches within a collective impact framework. Two surveys were conducted at baseline and at 10-month follow-up to evaluate the campaign within the Omaha and Council Bluffs intervention region, and a control region in Iowa. Analysis revealed significant improvements in desires for social distance and perceptions toward treatment efficacy within the intervention group. Improvements were seen across measures of personal and community attitudes towards mental health conditions, confidence in supporting others, and likelihood of disclosing a mental health condition. The trends were generally not replicated within the control group. Respondents who were aware of the campaign showed fewer stigmatizing views, including lower desires for social distance, improved attitudes toward treatment, and significant improvements in providing support and caring for their own mental health. The results suggest that the implemented evidenced-based approach could potentially create positive shifts in stigma reduction.

Mental Practice Enhances Surgical Technical Skills: A Randomized Controlled Study,Not mental health,"Arora, S; Aggarwal, R; Sirimanna, P; Moran, A; Grantcharov, T; Kneebone, R; Sevdalis, N; Darzi, A",OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY,2011,"The training of surgeons has traditionally been accomplished through an apprenticeship to experienced surgeons and repeated practice upon the patients. Because of increasing emphasis on patient safety, operating room is not the best environment for surgical training, and so there is a need for alternative training arenas. Simulation allows trainees to practice their skills in a realistic setting without any risk to the patient. Mental practice (MP), also termed as mental simulation, has been defined as the cognitive rehearsal of a task before performance, and it has been successfully used in sports and music to enhance psychomotor performance. In a recent study, the present investigators developed an MP training strategy in laparoscopic surgery; empirical findings showed that this strategy enhanced imagery in both novice and expert surgeons. It has not been demonstrated, however, that the skills gained through enhanced imagery can actually achieve superior operative physical performance among novice surgeons. This randomized controlled study investigated whether MP using a validated training strategy would enhance the performance of novice surgeons in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Participants included 20 novice surgeons who underwent MP training using an evidence-based virtual reality curriculum. The 18 surgeons who completed the study were randomized to either the intervention (MP group, n = 9) or the control group (n = 9). Performance was evaluated in 5 LC virtual reality sessions. Immediately before performing each LC session, the intervention group, but not the control group, received MP for 30 minutes. The Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills-based global rating scale was used by experienced surgeons to assess quality of performance (scores ranged from 7 to 35, with the latter reflecting excellent performance). Participants completed a validated Mental Imagery questionnaire to assess mental imagery just before performing each LC session. There were no intergroup differences in baseline surgical skills among the 18 participants completing the study. Learning curves were demonstrated for both the groups. The quality of performance was significantly superior in the MP group compared to the control group for all 5 LC sessions: 1 (median, 20.0 vs. 15.0; P = 0.005); 2 (median, 20.5 vs. 13.5; P = 0.001); 3 (median, 24.0 vs. 15.5; P < 0.001); 4 (median 25.5 vs. 15.5; P < 0.001); and 5 (median, 27.5 vs. 19.5; P 0.001). Mental imagery was also superior for the MP group across all sessions (P < 0.05). These findings are the first in a randomized controlled study to clearly demonstrate that MP enhances the quality of performance in virtual reality LC among novice surgeons. The data suggest that MP may be a time-and cost-effective strategy to augment traditional training in real patients and has the potential to improve patient outcomes for all types of surgery.",10.1097/OGX.0b013e31822c17e1,wos,Obstetrics & Gynecology,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1097/OGX.0b013e31822c17e1)
Mental Practice as an Additional Step Before Simulation Practice Facilitates Training in Bronchoscopic Intubation,Not Digital,"Urner, M; De Lama, G; Mema, B",RESPIRATORY CARE,2021,"BACKGROUND: Learning bronchoscopy is challenging for novices, as it requires navigation in a 3-dimensional space under 2-dimensional viewing conditions and execution of complex motor skills with an unfamiliar instrument. Mental practice exercises are based on repeated visualization of motor actions without physically performing them, thereby promoting the learning of skills. We aimed to evaluate whether a teaching intervention including mental practice exercise modules for the acquisition of bronchoscopy skills improves fiberoptic intubation performance of novice learners. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 24 pediatric intensive care trainees and respiratory therapists participating in a bronchoscopy learning curriculum in 2016-2017 attended a theoretical lecture followed by self-guided learning. Subsequently, the learners were randomly assigned to either participating in a teaching intervention including mental practice exercises or not (control group). The primary outcome was time to complete their first bronchoscopic intubation using a virtual reality simulator. Secondary outcomes were the occurrence of red outs (ie, the anatomy could no longer be visualized) or collisions with the airway wall. Bayesian Poisson Mixture models were used to estimate the effect of the intervention on outcomes. Furthermore, participation in the teaching intervention was examined in short interviews and with descriptive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Subjects in the intervention group completed the bronchoscopy on average 1.2 times faster (rate ratio 1.2 [95% credible intervals 1.1-1.3]). The posterior probability that the teaching intervention reduced the occurrence of red outs by more than half was 86%. No differences were found regarding the odds of colliding with the airway wall. Everyone except 1 trainee in the mental practice group engaged with and found the mental practice modules helpful. CONCLUSIONS: A teaching intervention including mental practice exercises represents a valuable additional learning strategy promoting the performance and complex skill acquisition of novice learners in the initial stages of learning bronchoscopy procedures.

Mental health burden of empty nose syndrome compared to chronic rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinitis,Not Multi User,"Lamb, M; Bacon, DR; Zeatoun, A; Onourah, P; Thorp, BD; Abramowitz, J; Ebert, CS; Kimple, AJ; Senior, BA",INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY,2022,"Background Empty nose syndrome (ENS) is characterized by the paradoxical perception of nasal obstruction despite patent sinonasal anatomy after surgery. We investigated the relationship between ENS, and anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and somatic symptom disorder (SSD) compared to individuals with chronic rhinitis (CR) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Methods This cross-sectional survey study compared ENS and CR and CRS patients. A total of 116 patients participated: 58 ENS patients from digital support groups, and 58 CRS and CR patients from tertiary rhinology clinics. Study participants completed four validated surveys: (1) Empty Nose Syndrome 6-Item Questionnaire, (2) Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI), (3) Obsessive Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R), and (4) PRIME MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Results ENS patients exhibited a mean RSDI of 78.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 72.8-84.5, compared to 25.2, 95% CI 18.6-31.8 for CRS/CR patients (p < 0.0001). This difference was seen across all subdomains. Using the PHQ, 53% of ENS patients met diagnostic thresholds for SSD compared to 14% of CRS patients (p < 0.0001). In relation to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), 18.37% of ENS patients compared to 8.62% of CRS/CR patients scored above the diagnostic threshold (>21) on the OCI-R questionnaire (p = 0.159). Conclusion ENS patients had diminished sinonasal quality of life and a higher prevalence of comorbid anxiety and depression, compared to CR and CRS.

Method for decision making in virtual library teams,Good,"Cordes, S",LIBRARY MANAGEMENT,2016,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate an action process method including coordination, monitoring, and backup response, to improve collaborative decision making in online library work teams. Design/methodology/approach - The method was tested using a single factor experimental design where some groups used an action process intervention developed by the researcher, while others used team designated ad hoc process. Participants comprised 26 four person teams. The experiment was performed in a distributed environment where teams used Google chat communication, and a shared Google document to organize, clarify, and evaluate information. Decision performance was measured in two ways. Decision accuracy was measured by the selection of a correct choice from four alternatives. Decision quality was measured by shift in suitability ratings from participants' individual choice to the correct answer after team discussion. Findings - Teams using an action process method based on monitoring, coordination, and backup behaviors had more accurate and higher quality decisions than groups using ad hoc process. Research limitations/implications - The research demonstrates usefulness of empirically designed, team implemented process methods to improve library decision making. Because the research was conducted in a single context, further research in alternative settings and contexts is suggested.

Aim: To compare the effects of anxiety management training via microlearning and gamification on anxiety control among girl adolescents. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial with pre/posttest design, the research population included 13-15-year-old girl adolescents studying in the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades of high school in Shiraz in the academic year 2018-2019. The participants (n=378) were randomly selected from the schools and assigned to microlearning (n=125), gamification (n=129), and control (n=124) groups. After conducting the pretest using Spielberger's state/trait anxiety inventory, the educational intervention was carried out via microlearning and gamification for four weeks. The adolescents' anxiety levels were measured again immediately and two weeks after the intervention. Results: The results revealed no significant difference among the three groups regarding the mean scores of state anxiety (p=0.07) and trait anxiety (p=0.26) before the intervention. However, a significant difference was observed among the three groups concerning anxiety scores immediately and two weeks after the intervention (p<0.001). This indicated the effectiveness of microlearning and gamification in reducing anxiety. Nonetheless, the two intervention methods were not significantly different in decreasing the level of anxiety (p>0.05). Conclusion: The results demonstrated a decline in the microlearning and gamification groups' scores of state and trait anxiety after the intervention. Yet, anxiety reduced to a similar level in both intervention groups. Hence, the two methods were similarly effective in controlling the adolescents' anxiety. Therefore, both microlearning and gamification could be used to promote adolescents' mental health.",NA,wos,General & Internal Medicine,Anxiety management; Adolescent; Virtual e-learning; Microlearning; Gamification,URI::(https://www.doi.org/NA)
Military museum collections and art therapy as mental health resources for veterans with PTSD,Other,"Lobban, J; Murphy, D",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART THERAPY,2020,"Background A veterans' mental health charity and Hampshire Cultural Trust collaborated to facilitate art therapy groups for veterans with service-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Aims The project aimed to improve the wellbeing of participants by tapping into their existing military knowledge, skills and expertise as a resource for mental health. Also, to explore how items from the museum collection might stimulate a sense of belonging that could moderate the isolating effects of PTSD, and later the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods Data was collected through established evaluation measures to rate wellbeing and loneliness, and through surveys tailored to the project. Focus groups and participant observation provided further data. Descriptive statistics of the quantitative data were then combined with thematic analysis of the overall data to provide the findings. Results Although military experiences were the cause of the veterans' mental health problems, and traumatic memories became stirred through recollections triggered by the museum items, the evidence suggests that participants experienced a sense of belonging which promoted self-confidence and social interaction, and improved wellbeing. Conclusions Through familiarity with the function of the artefacts, in-depth contextual knowledge, and shared military experience, the veterans were able to connect through an exploratory process. This was the case when the group was museum-based and when held remotely. Implications Military museums are potential mental health reservoirs for veterans. Digital art therapy sessions offer a way of involving and supporting socially avoidant or isolated veterans who cannot physically attend groups, as well as those who live out of the area. Plain-language summary During 2019, a veterans' mental health charity and Hampshire Cultural Trust collaborated to run art therapy groups for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with their military service. PTSD can have long-lasting consequences, such as social isolation and heightened anxiety. The project aimed to improve the wellbeing of participants by tapping into their existing military knowledge, skills and expertise as a resource for mental health. It was hoped that reconnecting with a range of memories from service life would counter-balance the weight of the distressing memories of military experiences that continued to have a detrimental effect. Each session involved looking at specific items from the museum's collection; making a creative response through image-making or creative writing; and discussing ideas. The informality of the meetings where participants were encouraged to share their military knowledge, took the focus away from having mental health problems. Simultaneously, the effects of their psychological injuries were lessened by recognition and use of their specialist abilities. Results were promising. Although military experiences were the cause of the veterans' mental health problems, and traumatic memories became stirred through recollections triggered by the museum items, the sense of belonging and camaraderie between veterans moderated the isolating effects of PTSD and enabled shared recollections. Further museum-based sessions were planned for 2020. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the group transferred to an online platform. This paper provides a comparison between in-person and remote working in this context. Digital art therapy sessions offer promise as a way of involving veterans who cannot physically attend groups for reasons such as distance or agoraphobia. It is hoped that this study might encourage other military museums to consider similar projects to support socially avoidant or isolated veterans.",10.1080/17454832.2020.1845220,wos,Psychology; Rehabilitation,Veterans; PTSD; online art therapy; COVID-19; museum; telehealth,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/17454832.2020.1845220)

"Mindfulness Applications: Can They Serve as a Stress, Anxiety, and Burnout Reduction Tool in Orthopaedic Surgery Training? A Randomized Control Trial",Not Multi User,"Boden, LM; Rodriguez, C; Kelly, JD; Khalsa, AS; Casper, DS",JBJS OPEN ACCESS,2023,"Background: Stress and burnout are prevalent within the orthopaedic surgery community. Mindfulness techniques have been shown to improve wellness, yet traditional courses are generally time-intensive with low surgeon utilization. We sought to determine whether the introduction of a simple mindfulness-based phone application would help decrease stress, anxiety, and burnout in orthopaedic surgery residents.Methods: Twenty-four residents participated in this prospective, randomized controlled trial. After simple 1:1 randomization, the treatment group received access to a mindfulness-based phone application for 2 months while the control group did not receive access. All participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Maslach Burnout Inventory with emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment subscores to measure stress, anxiety, and burnout at baseline and after 2 months. Paired t tests were used to compare baseline scores and conclusion scores for both groups.Results: There was no difference in baseline burnout scores between groups, but the treatment group had higher stress and anxiety scores at baseline. On average, the treatment group spent approximately 8 minutes per day, 2 days per week using the mindfulness application. After 2 months, the treatment group had significantly decreased stress (mean = -7.42, p = 0.002), anxiety (mean = -6.16, p = 0.01), EE (mean = -10.83 +/- 10.72, p = 0.005), and DP (mean = -5.17 +/- 5.51, p = 0.01). The control group did not have any significant differences in stress, anxiety, or burnout subscores.Conclusions: Use of a mindfulness-based phone app for 2 months led to significant reductions in stress, anxiety, and burnout scores in orthopaedic surgery residents. Our results support the use of a mindfulness-based app to help decrease orthopaedic resident stress, anxiety, and burnout. Benefits were seen with only modest use, suggesting that intensive mindfulness training programs may not be necessary to effect a change in well-being. The higher baseline stress and anxiety in the treatment group may suggest that mindfulness techniques are particularly effective in those who perceive residency to be more stressful.",10.2106/JBJS.OA.22.00114,"pubmed, wos",Orthopedics; Surgery,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2106/JBJS.OA.22.00114)

In addition, the intervention group had a marginally significant decrease in self-measured workday systolic blood pressure from pre- to post-intervention. Sustained positive effects in the intervention group were found for well-being and job strain at the 16-week follow-up assessment.

Mindfulness based intervention through mobile app for colorectal cancer people awaiting surgery: A randomized clinical trial,Population,"González, CR; Vega, BR; Zarcero, MT; Mediavilla, R; Molina, NB; Fernández, RP; Migueláñez, IP; Tarrero, AP",CIRUGIA ESPANOLA,2022,"Introduction: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide both in men and women. Around one-third of patients with cancer will suffer from anxiety or depression symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a Mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention through a mobile application (En Calma en el Quirofano''). Method: This study is a multicenter, single-blind (evaluator), controlled, randomised trial that compares the effectiveness of a mindfulness training through a mobile application (intervention group) and treatment as usual (control group) in three different moments (T0 or baseline, T1 or hospital discharge and T2 or one month after surgery). Anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS), quality of life (WHOQOL), pain, (VAS) and satisfaction (CSQ) were assessed. Results: In all, there were 270 referred patients. Among them, 39 and 43 were assigned to the intervention and control groups respectively. 82 patients were analyzed: 39 patients used the app, and 43 patients continued with the treatment as usual. There were no significant changes between groups and time. We observed a slight trend in which intervention group had less depression and anxiety symptoms since T0 and T2 (B = similar to 0.2; 95% CI between 8.8 and 9.2). Conclusions: The sample of this study had a high mean age (65 years old), and low levels of anxiety and depression and medium levels of pre-surgery quality of life in baseline. These factors could have influenced limiting the effectiveness of the app. Prospective research lines should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of mobile applications for younger patients with surgical pathologies.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction for community-dwelling older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in primary care: a mixed-methods feasibility randomized control trial,Good,"Tran, T; Donnelly, C; Nalder, E; Trothen, T; Finlayson, M",BMC PRIMARY CARE,2023,"BackgroundPrimary care is often the first point of contact when community-dwelling older adults experience subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Living with SCD or MCI can be life-altering, resulting in low mood and increased anxiety, further exacerbating cognitive decline. However, there is scant literature on interventions that interprofessional primary care providers can provide to support those living with SCD or MCI. Practicing mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in an interprofessional primary care setting may support emotional health and well-being for those with cognitive decline, but it has not been studied in an interprofessional primary care context.ObjectivesThis study's primary aim was to determine the feasibility of, and perceived benefits to and satisfaction with, a 9-Week MBSR program delivered in a team-based primary care setting. The secondary aim was to examine the acceptability of using technology (computer tablet and App Insight Timer (R)) for program delivery and home practice.MethodsA convergent mixed-methods, single-blind pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) study design was used. A quantitative strand was used to evaluate the feasibility of the MBSR program. The qualitative strand used a focus group with older adult participants with SCD or MCI. Individual semi-structured interviews with occupational therapists who are qualified-MBSR teachers were conducted to explore the acceptability of using computer tablets for program delivery and home practice.Results27 participants were randomized (14 MBSR; 13 Control) with retention rates of 64.3% (9/14 completed >= 6 sessions), true adherence rates of 50% (7/14 met >= 19.5 hrs of home practice), 21.4% attrition rates, and 100% post-intervention follow-up. No participants who used computer tablets at the beginning of the intervention switched to low technology. Older adult participants found the use of computer tablets in the MBSR course acceptable and appreciated the portability of the tablets.ConclusionsBased on the lower-than-expected rates of recruitment, retention, and adherence, our study, as designed, did not meet the feasibility benchmarks that were set. However, with minor modifications to the design, including changing how participants who drop-out are analyzed, extending recruitment, and adding multiple sites, this intervention would be well suited to further study using a full-scale RCT. However, we found that embedding MBSR in an interprofessional primary care setting was feasible in practice and qualitative data highlighted the satisfaction and perceived benefits based on the intervention. The use of technology was acceptable and portable, as participants utilized their computer tablets consistently until the study's end. Our study showed that older adults living with SCD or MCI were highly receptive to learning how to use technology, and future group intervention programs in interprofessional primary care settings may also incorporate tablet use.",10.1186/s12875-023-02002-y,"pubmed, wos",General & Internal Medicine,Mindfulness; Occupational therapy; Subjective cognitive decline; Mild cognitive impairment; Interprofessional primary care; Technology,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12875-023-02002-y)
Minecraft in Education Benefits Learning and Social Engagement,Other,"Alawajee, O; Delafield-Butt, J",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GAME-BASED LEARNING,2021,"Empirical evidence suggests game-based learning (GBL) as a potentially engaging form of contemporary learning. With the increase in the use of Minecraft, a sandbox computer game in open-world format, there has been a concurrent rise in the level of interest in investigating the role of Minecraft in social and academic learning. Minecraft is socially interactive, and its cooperative, rather than competitive, open-world gameplay suggests that it could be used for educational purposes. This paper presents a systematic review of all published peer-reviewed research and synthesises the evidence for and against Minecraft's use in education to better understand the applicability of Minecraft in educational and psychological interventions. Forty-two papers were identified. These revealed Minecraft to be beneficial in terms of increased motivation, language development, and academic learning in subjects such as science and history. Minecraft play also supported the development of social skills, including communication, sharing, collaboration, and leadership. Concerns about ageappropriateness, safety, technology use, and learning generalisation were raised, but on balance, the evidence favours an informed and guided employment of Minecraft for improved opportunities for learning and engagement in education.",10.4018/IJGBL.2021100102,wos,Education & Educational Research,Digital Classrooms; Games-Based Learning; Minecraft; Serious Games; Teaching and Learning,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.4018/IJGBL.2021100102)

Objective: We evaluated the impact of a digitally enabled care mobile app, Pathway, designed to improve MDD patient-provider engagement. Patients used a mobile interface to assess treatment progress and share this information with primary care providers (PCPs). Methods: In this 52-week, real-world effectiveness and feasibility study conducted in primary care clinics, 40 patients with MDD who were recently prescribed antidepressant monotherapy were randomized to use a mobile app with usual care (20/40, 50%) or usual care alone (20/40, 50%). Patients in the app arm engaged with the app daily for 18 weeks; a report was generated at 6-week intervals and shared with the PCPs to facilitate shared treatment decision-making discussions. The patients discontinued the app at week 18 and were followed through year 1. Coprimary outcome measures, assessed via research visits, included change from baseline in the 13-item Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13) and 7-item Patient-Provider Engagement Scale scores at week 18. Additional outcome measures included depression severity (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) and cognitive symptoms (5-item Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-Depression). Results: All 37 patients (app arm: n=18, 49%; usual care arm: n=19, 51%) who completed the 18-week follow-up period (n=31, 84% female, mean age 36, SD 11.3 years) had moderate to moderately severe depression. Improvements in PAM-13 and PHQ-9 scores were observed in both arms. Increases in PAM-13 scores from baseline to 18 weeks were numerically greater in the app arm than in the usual care arm (mean 10.5, SD 13.2 vs mean 8.8, SD 9.4; P=.65). At 52 weeks, differences in PAM-13 scores from baseline demonstrated significantly greater improvements in the app arm than in the usual care arm (mean 20.2, SD 17.7 vs mean 1.6, SD 14.2; P=.04).

The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a mobile app-based intervention to improve community functioning in adolescents with FEP. Mobile app-based interventions could increase quality of life and disease awareness, which improve adherence to treatment and reduce the frequency of relapses and rehospitalizations in adolescents with FEP. Methods: This article describes a mobile app treatment and the pilot trial protocol for patients with FEP. We will perform a single-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) including patients with FEP aged 14-19 years recruited from Gregorio Mare& Hospital, Madrid, Spain. Patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention group, which will receive treatment as usual plus five modules of a psychological intervention through the mobile app (psychoeducation, recognition of symptoms and prevention of relapses, problem solving, mindfulness, and contact wall), or to a control group (standard care). The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed by means of an extensive battery of clinical tests at baseline and at 3 months of follow-up. The primary outcome is reduction in psychotic and depressive symptoms; secondary outcomes comprise adherence, awareness, use of drugs, and quality of life.

Moreover, easily accessible and innovative support is lacking. Objective: The purpose of this trial was to determine the effectiveness of an app-based breast cancer e-support program to address women's self-efficacy (primary outcome), social support, symptom distress, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Secondary objectives included exploring the association between women's health outcomes and the breast cancer e-support usage data. Methods: A multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 114 women with breast cancer, who were commencing chemotherapy and were able to access internet through a mobile phone, were recruited in the clinics from 2 university-affiliated hospitals in China. Women were randomized either to the intervention group (n=57) receiving breast cancer e-support plus care as usual or the control group (n=57) receiving care as usual alone. The health care team and research assistants collecting data were blinded to the women's group allocation. Bandura's selfefficacy theory and the social exchange theory guided the development of the breast cancer e-support program, which has 4 components: (1) a Learning forum, (2) a Discussion forum, (3) an Ask-the-Expert forum, and (4) a Personal Stories forum. Moderated by an experienced health care professional, the breast cancer e-support program supported women for 12 weeks covering 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Health outcomes were self-assessed through paper questionnaires in clinics at baseline before randomization (T0), after 3 (T1), and 6 months (T2) of follow-ups. Results: Fifty-five participants in the intervention group and 49 in the control group completed the follow-up assessments (response rate: 91.2%). During the 12-week intervention, the log-in frequency ranged from 0 to 774 times (mean 54.7; SD 131.4; median 11; interquartile range, IQR 5-27), and the total usage duration ranged from 0 to 9371 min (mean 1072.3; SD 2359.5; median 100; IQR 27-279). Repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance (intention-to-treat) found that breast cancer e-support + care as usual participants had significant better health outcomes at 3 months regarding self-efficacy (21.05; 95% CI 1.87-40.22; P=.03; d=0.53), symptom interference (-0.73; 95% CI-1.35 to-. 11; P=.02; d=-0.51), and quality of life (6.64; 95% CI 0.77-12.50; P=.03, d=0.46) but not regarding social support, symptom severity, anxiety, and depression compared with care as usual participants. These beneficial effects were not sustained at 6 months.

Mobile Health (mHealth) Versus Clinic-Based Group Intervention for People With Serious Mental Illness: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Ben-Zeev D, Brian RM, Jonathan G, Razzano L, Pashka N, Carpenter-Song E, Drake RE, Scherer EA.",Psychiatr Serv,2018,"Objective: mHealth approaches that use mobile phones to deliver interventions can help improve access to care for people with serious mental illness. The goal was to evaluate how mHealth performs against more traditional treatment.

Methods: A three-month randomized controlled trial was conducted of a smartphone-delivered intervention (FOCUS) versus a clinic-based group intervention (Wellness Recovery Action Plan [WRAP]). Participants were 163 clients, mostly from racial minority groups and with long-term, serious mental illness (schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 49%; bipolar disorder, 28%; and major depressive disorder, 23%). Outcomes were engagement throughout the intervention; satisfaction posttreatment (three months); and improvement in clinical symptoms, recovery, and quality of life (assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and six months).

Results: Participants assigned to FOCUS were more likely than those assigned to WRAP to commence treatment (90% versus 58%) and remain fully engaged in eight weeks of care (56% versus 40%). Satisfaction ratings were comparably high for both interventions. Participants in both groups improved significantly and did not differ in clinical outcomes, including general psychopathology and depression. Significant improvements in recovery were seen for the WRAP group posttreatment, and significant improvements in recovery and quality of life were seen for the FOCUS group at six months.

Conclusions: Both interventions produced significant gains among clients with serious and persistent mental illnesses who were mostly from racial minority groups. The mHealth intervention showed superior patient engagement and produced patient satisfaction and clinical and recovery outcomes that were comparable to those from a widely used clinic-based group intervention for illness management.

Leveraging mobile health (mHealth) strategies to increase adherence to PA is a promising approach Based on the social cognitive theory, we sought to determine whether mHealth strategies (Movn mobile app for self-monitoring, supportive push-through messages, and wearable activity tracker) would improve PA and functional capacity over 2 months. Objective: The objectives of this pilot randomized controlled trial were to examine preliminary effects of an mHealth intervention on group differences in PA and functional capacity and group differences in depression and self-efficacy to maintain exercise after CR. Methods: During the final week of outpatient CR, patients were randomized 1:1 to the intervention group or usual care. The intervention group downloaded the Movn mobile app, received supportive push-through messages on motivation and educational messages related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) management 3 times per week, and wore a Charge 2 (Fitbit Inc) activity tracker to track step counts. Participants in the usual care group wore a pedometer and recorded their daily steps in a diary. Data from the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and self-reported questionnaires were collected at baseline and 2 months. Results: We recruited 60 patients from 2 CR sites at a community hospital in Northern California. The mean age was 68.0 (SD 9.3) years, and 23% (14/60) were female; retention rate was 85% (51/60). Our results from 51 patients who completed follow-up showed the intervention group had a statistically significant higher mean daily step count compared with the control (8860 vs 6633; P=.02). There was no difference between groups for the 6MWT, depression, or self-efficacy to maintain exercise. Conclusions: This intervention addresses a major public health initiative to examine the potential for mobile health strategies to promote PA in patients with CVD. Our technology-based pilot mHealth intervention provides promising results on a pragmatic and contemporary approach to promote PA by increasing daily step counts after completing CR.",10.2196/20468,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,physical activity; cardiac rehabilitation; digital health; mobile app; wearable device; mHealth,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/20468)

We provide the rationale, design, and preliminary data from 3 ongoing clinical trials of mobile interventions developed for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Project 1 used a personal digital assistant to prompt engagement in personalized self-management behaviors based on real-time data. Project 2 employed experience sampling through text messages to facilitate case management. Project 3 was built on group functional skills training for schizophrenia by incorporating between-session mobile phone contacts with therapists. Preliminary findings were of minimal participant attrition, and no broken devices; yet, several operational and technical barriers needed to be addressed.

Mobile Mental Health in Women's Community-Based Organizations: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,Other,"Bhat, A; Goud, BR; Kalidindi, B; Ruben, JP; Devadass, D; Waghmare, A; Collins, PY; Raj, T; Srinivasan, K",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2023,"Background: Of every 10 women in rural India, 1 suffers from a common mental disorder such as depression, and untreated depression is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Several factors lead to a large treatment gap, specifically for women in rural India, including stigma, lack of provider mental health workforce, and travel times. There is an urgent need to improve the rates of detection and treatment of depression among women in rural India without overburdening the scarce mental health resources.Objective: We propose to develop, test, and deploy a mental health app, MITHRA (Multiuser Interactive Health Response Application), for depression screening and brief intervention, designed for use in women's self-help groups (SHGs) in rural India.Methods: We will use focus groups with SHG members and community health workers to guide the initial development of the app, followed by iterative modification based on input from a participatory design group consisting of proposed end users of the app (SHG members). The final version of the app will then be deployed for testing in a pilot cluster randomized trial, with 3 SHGs randomized to receive the app and 3 to receive enhanced care as usual.Results: This study was funded in June 2021. As of September 2022, we have completed both focus groups, 1 participatory design group, and app development.Conclusions: Delivering app-based depression screening and treatment in community settings such as SHGs can address stigma and transportation-related barriers to access to depression care and overcome cultural and contextual barriers to mobile health use. It can also address the mental health workforce shortage. If we find that the MITHRA approach is feasible, we will test the implementation and effectiveness of MITHRA in multiple SHGs across India in a larger randomized controlled trial.

"Mobile Technologies for Supporting Mental Health in Youths: Scoping Review of Effectiveness, Limitations, and Inclusivity",Good,"Litke, SG; Resnikoff, A; Anil, A; Montgomery, M; Matta, R; Huh-Yoo, J; Daly, BP",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2023,"Background: Over the past decade, there has been growing support for the use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies to improve the availability of mental health interventions. While mHealth is a promising tool for improving access to interventions, research on the effectiveness and efficacy of mHealth apps for youths is limited, particularly for underrepresented populations, including youths of color and economically marginalized youths.Objective: This scoping review study sought to evaluate the following research questions: (1) What is the extent of the current literature on mHealth apps that provide intervention for mental health problems in children and adolescents? (2) What is known from the existing literature about the effectiveness or efficacy of delivering mental health services via mHealth apps? (3) What are the gaps in the knowledge base in the fields of technology and mental health? (4) Do the reviewed mHealth apps address issues of cultural sensitivity or have they been tested with underrepresented groups (ie, youths of color or economically marginalized groups)?Methods: An electronic database search was conducted using relevant search terms. Seven independent reviewers screened identified studies, including title and abstract review to determine if studies met the following inclusion criteria: (1) targeted samples with mental health symptomology or disorders, (2) studied youth participants aged 6-17 years, and (3) examined the use of a mobile app-based platform for intervention. Relevant studies were subjected to full-text review to extract and chart relevant data based on a priori research questions.Results: The initial database search yielded 304 papers published from 2010 to 2021. After screening and selection, the final review included 10 papers on the effectiveness and efficacy of mental health intervention apps for youths aged 8 to 17 years. Identified apps targeted a broad range of mental health challenges in youths (ie, depression, self-harm, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder). Results identified only a small number of studies suggesting that current effectiveness and efficacy research in this area are limited. While some studies provided general support for the effectiveness of mHealth apps in improving mental health outcomes in youths, several notable limitations were present across the literature, reducing the generalizability of findings. Additionally, considerations around racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity were scarce across studies.Conclusions: Although some studies cited in this scoping review provide support for the effectiveness and efficacy of mHealth apps targeting mental health concerns in youths, the overall body of literature remains quite limited. Moreover, mHealth apps expressly developed to be culturally responsive are almost nonexistent. Further efforts are needed to recruit youths who are typically underrepresented in research and invite stakeholder participation and collaborative input in the early stages of the mHealth app development process.",10.2196/46949,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/46949)
Mobile app for prolonged grief among bereaved parents: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,Other,"Eklund, R; Eisma, MC; Boelen, PA; Arnberg, FK; Sveen, J",BMJ OPEN,2021,"Introduction Bereaved parents, who have lost a child, have an elevated risk to develop mental health problems, yet, few studies have evaluated the effect of psychosocial interventions developed for bereaved parents. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), both face to face or digitally delivered, has shown to be an effective intervention for prolonged grief symptoms. Self-help mobile apps offer various advantages and studies show improved mental health after app interventions. No app has yet been evaluated targeting prolonged grief in bereaved parents. Therefore, the aim of this planned study is to develop and examine the effectiveness of a CBT-based mobile app, called My Grief, in reducing symptoms of prolonged grief, as well as other psychological symptoms, in bereaved parents. Mother aim is to assess users' experiences and adverse events of My Grief. Methods and analysis We will conduct a two-armed randomised waitlist-controlled trial. Parents living in Sweden, who lost a child between one and ten years ago, with elevated symptoms of prolonged grief, will be recruited to participate in the trial. The content of My Grief covers four main domains (Learn; Self-monitoring; Exercises; Get support) and builds on principles of CBT and the proven-effective PTSD Coach app. Participants in the intervention group will fill out online questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-ups, and the waitlist-controls at baseline and at 3 months. The primary outcome will be prolonged grief symptoms at the 3 months follow-up.

Mobile application to support oncology patients during treatment on patient outcomes: Evidence from a randomized controlled trial,Not mental health,"Graetz, I; Hu, X; Curry, AN; Robles, A; Vidal, GA; Schwartzberg, LS",CANCER MEDICINE,2023,"Background Cancer treatment requires substantial demands on patients and their caregivers. Mobile apps can provide support for self-management during oncology treatment, but few have been rigorously evaluated. Methods A 3-month randomized controlled trial was conducted at a large cancer center to evaluate the efficacy of an app (LivingWith (R)) that provides self-management support during cancer treatment on quality of life and health care utilization. Patients in chemotherapy treatment were randomized into the intervention (n = 113) and control group (n = 111). Intervention group participants agreed to use the app weekly for 3 months, and all participants completed a survey at enrollment and after 3 months to evaluate changes in quality of life and health care utilization. Results Retention rate was 75.4% with 169 participants completing the follow-up survey. The intervention group reported 0.74 fewer medical office visits (p = 0.043) and 0.24 fewer visits with a mental health professional (p = 0.061) during the 3 and month intervention compared with controls. There were no significant changes by study group in quality of life, or emergency room and urgent care visits. Among intervention participants, 75.3% reported using the app and on average, used it 11.7 times during the 3-month intervention. Reasons for not using the app among intervention participants included lack of time, lack of interest in apps, and usability challenges. Conclusions and Relevance Apps are inexpensive and scalable tools that can provide additional support for individuals coping with complex cancer treatments. This trial provides evidence that a well-designed oncology support app used during chemotherapy resulted in fewer clinic visits. Still, nearly a quarter of participants randomized to the intervention arm reported never using the app due to personal preference and usability challenges, which points to future opportunities for calibrating target user population and improving user-centered design.

Mobile sensor-based community gaming for improving vocational students' sleep and academic outcomes,Other,"Wang, JS; Gamble, JH; Yang, YTC",COMPUTERS & EDUCATION,2020,"Quality sleep is critical for teenagers' physical and mental health and, consequently, learning achievement. Technology, particularly the use of mobile sensors and digital game-based learning, has the potential to enhance students' sleep hygiene, reducing insomnia and daytime sleepiness and improving students' academic performance. Therefore, this study implemented and evaluated a sleep hygiene instruction intervention in terms of three elements: a) mobile sleep sensor data feedback for sleep self-evaluation; b) a collaborative-competitive mobile community game (MCG) for sleep promotion based on social-interdependence; and c) an instructional intervention adopting a social cognitive approach. To validate the efficacy of the instructional design, a pretest-posttest quasi-experiment was conducted with 114 10th grade students from three classes of an urban vocational high school in Taiwan. The three intact classes were randomly assigned to one of three sleep hygiene courses: a comparison group (37 students receiving sleep sensor feedback), experimental group one (E1; 38 students receiving sleep sensor feedback and adopting MCG), and experimental group two (E2; 39 students receiving sleep sensor feedback, adopting MCG, and taking a social cognitive-based course). The empirical results suggest that the use of sleep sensor feedback and the MCG (E1 and E2) effectively improved the sleep behaviors of vocational students. In fact, inclusion of the mobile sensor with feedback on sleep quality was sufficient to provide improvement in both sleep and academic outcomes for all students. These results demonstrate the promising potential of mobile community-based technological interventions for improving sleep hygiene, relieving insomnia daytime sleepiness, when integrated with either traditional or social cognitive-based sleep courses.

Mobility enhancement among older adults 75+in rural areas: Study protocol of the MOBILE randomized controlled trial,Not mental health,"Haeger, C; Mümken, SA; O'Sullivan, JL; Spang, RP; Voigt-Antons, JN; Stockburger, M; Dräger, D; Gellert, P",BMC GERIATRICS,2022,"Background: Maintaining mobility in old age is crucial for healthy ageing including delaying the onset and progress of frailty. However, the extent of an individuals' mobility relies largely on their personal, social, and environmental resources as outlined in the Life-Space Constriction Model. Recent studies mainly focus on facilitating habitual out-of-home mobility by fostering one type of resources only. The MOBILE trial aims at testing whether tablet-assisted motivational counselling enhances the mobility of community-dwelling older adults by addressing personal, social, and environmental resources. Methods: In the MOBILE randomized controlled trial, we plan to enrol 254 community-dwelling older adults aged 75 and older from Havelland, a rural area in Germany. The intervention group will receive a tablet-assisted motivational counselling at the participant's home and two follow-up telephone sessions. Main focus of the counselling sessions lays on setting and adapting individual mobility goals and applying action planning and habit formation strategies by incorporating the personal social network and regional opportunities for engaging in mobility related activities. The control group will receive postal general health information. The primary mobility outcome is time out-of-home assessed by GPS (GPS.Rec2.0-App) at three points in time (baseline, after one month, and after three months for seven consecutive days each). Secondary outcomes are the size of the GPS-derived life-space convex hull, self-reported life-space mobility (LSA-D), physical activity (IPAQ), depressive symptoms (GDS), frailty phenotype, and health status (SF-12). Discussion: The MOBILE trial will test the effect of a motivational counselling intervention on out-of-home mobility in community-dwelling older adults.

Demographics and epidemiologic transitions create several challenges to the health system in Thailand in the case of long term care policies, in particular, modality to support home care. Therefore, the model development to facilitate primary care home services for elderly patients with NCDs using an innovative network of homecare providers (WinCare) was established. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of WinCare to improve blood pressure (BP) control as well as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among elderly patients with NCDs. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted between July 2019 and January 2020 in a suburban area, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. The intervention included WinCare providers and WinCare application. WinCare provided check-in visits to measure subjects blood pressure and body weight (once weekly), played the roles of other home caregivers for the patients and recorded measurements and activities in the WinCare app for 6 months. The primary outcomes of the study were differences in systolic BP, diastolic BP, and controlled BP (systolic BP < 140 mmHg and diastolic BP < 90 mmHg) at 6-month follow-up between the intervention and control groups, adjusting for age, sex, marital status, comorbidities, alcohol consumption and smoking status. Results: A total of 104 subjects were initially recruited. Of the remaining 98 individuals, 52 were allocated to the intervention group and 46 to the control group. After adjusting baseline characteristics, no association existed between decreasing average systolic BP and intervention groups. However, diastolic BP of patients in the intervention group was on average 5.19 mmHg (95% CI -8.22, - 2.17) lower compared than that of the control group at 6-month follow-up. Furthermore, compared with patients in the control group, those in the intervention group were more likely to control BP, (AOR 3.03; 95% CI 1.02-9.01) at 6-month follow-up.

Modelling Well-Being with Mindfulness Intervention on Bottom- and Middle-40% Income Earners in Malaysia,Good,"Zaidi FZ, Lai MM, Jumaat A, Lee Y.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2023,"This paper examines mindfulness as a costless cognitive asset in reducing stress and improving subjective well-being and psychological well-being among Malaysian bottom-forty-percent and middle-forty-percent income earners, known as B40 and M40, respectively. The participants recruited for this experimental study were divided into intervention and control groups and completed pre- and post-assessment questionnaires. The leveraging on digital technologies during pandemic times from May to June 2021 enabled participants in the intervention group (n = 95) to undergo four weekly online mindfulness intervention sessions through Google Meet and completed daily home mindfulness practices using the mobile application for mindfulness: the MindFi version 3.8.0 mobile app. Based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the intervention group’s mindfulness and well-being levels increased significantly after four weeks. This outcome contrasted to those in the control group (n = 31), who exhibited lower mindfulness and well-being levels. The PLS-SEM structural model consists of mindfulness as an independent variable, subjective and psychological well-being as dependent variables, and perceived stress and financial desire discrepancies as the mediators. This model has a goodness-of-fit of 0.076, proving that it is a fit and strong model. There is a positive relationship between mindfulness and subjective well-being (β = 0.162, p-value < 0.01). This model supports the mediation effect of perceived stress between mindfulness and subjective well-being variables (β = 0.152, p-value < 0.05). The overall structural model implies that the effectiveness of mindfulness intervention training not only enhanced bottom- and middle-income earners’ well-being but also lowered the perceived stress level that, henceforth, brought the mind and body together in the present moment.",10.3390/ijerph20043480,pubmed,NA,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20043480)
Models and strategies for addressing problematic consumption in times of Covid-19,Not mental health,"Baglione, MF",CULTURA Y DROGA,2023,"The advent of the Covid-19 pandemic and the social and health measures used by the Argentine Government since March 20, 2020, have required rapid adaptation by the various devices to address problematic consumption. Due to this, protocols based on isolation and social distancing became the pillars on which new forms of individual or group intervention began to be outlined. In this sense, the purpose of this article was to reconstruct and compare the experience lived by six referents from the Buenos Aires suburbs, emphasizing the challenges, lines of action and approach modalities adopted. To achieve this, a qualitative methodology was used whose scope was descriptive-explanatory. The main results showed that the strategies used by the addressing devices were mainly the cessation or limitation of face-to-face meetings and the adoption of technologies as a viable strategy to sustain the link. However, these actions generated heterogeneous responses and challenges. On the one hand, there were people who had the resources, time and personal space to hold virtual meetings. But, on the other hand, there were people for whom this new modality represented an access barrier either due to lack of resources (cell phone, internet, credit) or the impossibility of having a private place to speak freely.

Digital interventions provide a promising solution.Objective: Our objective was to evaluate across multiple Australian early psychosis services the effectiveness of a novel, web-based early psychosis intervention for carers.Methods: In this cluster randomized controlled trial conducted across multiple Australian early psychosis services, our digital moderated online social therapy for carers (Altitudes) plus enhanced family treatment as usual (TAU) was compared with TAU alone on the primary outcome of perceived stress and secondary outcomes including mental health symptoms and family variables at the 6-month follow-up.Results: Eighty-six caregivers were randomized and data were available for 74 young people in their care. Our primary hypothesis that carers randomized to Altitudes+TAU would report greater improvements in perceived stress at follow-up compared with carers randomized to TAU alone was not supported, with the TAU alone group showing more improvement. For secondary outcomes, the TAU alone group showed improved mindfulness over time. Regardless of group assignment, we observed improvements in satisfaction with life, quality of life, emotional overinvolvement, and burden of care. In contrast, hair cortisol concentration increased. Post hoc analyses revealed more contact with early psychosis services in the intervention group compared to TAU alone and that improvements in perceived stress and social support were associated with use of the intervention in the Altitudes+TAU group. In this study, 80% (12/15) reported a positive experience with Altitudes and 93% (14/15) would recommend it to others.Conclusions: Our trial did not show a treatment effect for Altitudes in perceived stress. However, our post hoc analysis indicated that the amount of use of Altitudes related to improvements in stress and social support.

"Moderating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's and adolescents' substance use, digital media use, and mental health: A randomized positive psychology addiction prevention program",Not Multi User,"Kor, A; Shoshani, A",ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS,2023,"Objective: Previous research suggests that well-being interventions are effective in moderating substance and digital media use and improving mental health. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a school-based Positive Psychology Addiction Prevention (PPAP) intervention aimed at reducing substance and digital media use and increasing the mental health of school children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The sample was composed of 1,670 children and adolescents (Mean age = 12.96, SD = 2.01) from six elementary and secondary schools in Israel who were randomly assigned to the PPAP intervention (n = 833) or the waiting-list control conditions (n = 837). A three-year longitudinal repeated-measures randomized control design was used to examine modifications in substance use, digital media use, and psychological symptoms in the intervention and control groups assessed on the pre-test (before the outbreak of COVID-19, September 2019), the post-test (May 2021), and the 12-month follow-up (May 2022). Results: The 12-month prevalence of tobacco use, alcohol use, and cannabis use decreased significantly from the pre-to the follow-up period in the intervention group, and increased significantly in the control group. Daily digital media use increased during the pandemic period in both groups, with a significantly higher increase in the control group. The intervention group reported significantly lower psychological symptoms and negative emo-tions, and greater positive emotions and life satisfaction after the intervention and at follow-up compared to the control group.

"Modern technology to support carers of care recipients with dementia or functional mental illness: promising progress, but a long road ahead",Not Multi User,"Lautenschlager, NT; Diehl-Schmid, J; Loi, SM; Mayer, J; Tensil, M; Kurz, AF",INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS,2017,"There is no doubt that family carers who look after a family member with dementia or with a functional mental illness fulfill an important role, not only for their loved one, but also for the health and aged care systems of the countries they live in. Due to increasing life expectancy, but also improved healthcare the number of family carers supporting older care recipients with functional mental illness or dementia is on the rise. While the carer role often can offer rewarding experiences caregivers are at increased risk of stress, depression, sleep problems, and often experience poor health outcomes with increased morbidity and mortality (Oyebode, 2003). Next to the stressors directly associated with the carer role, they often do not have the time to engage in healthy behavior to protect their physical, mental, and cognitive health (Loi et al., 2014). There is a wealth of literature providing evidence about effective strategies to support carers and the recent Lancet Commission on Dementia prevention, intervention, and care highlighted the importance of exploring how the use of technological innovations could support carers better (Livingston et al., 2017). The use of modern technology in this context can mean a variety of approaches, such as internet-based programs to provide education and skill-building, virtual support to assist with monitoring and managing challenging behavior, online support groups, and the use of assistive or therapeutic technology to improve safety, enable positive activities, and support communication between carer and care recipient, to name just a few (D'Onofrio et al., 2017; Ienca et al., 2017; Livingston et al., 2017). More specifically, telehealth approaches via videoconferences have the potential to better support carers who live in rural or remote regions (O'Connell et al., 2014) or who cannot attend face-to-face support programs for other reasons such as inability to leave the care recipient alone at home, being a multiple carer or having a disability themselves to give just some examples.",10.1017/S1041610217002150,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Psychiatry,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1017/S1041610217002150)
Modification in the Motor Skills of Seniors in Care Homes Using Serious Games and the Impact of COVID-19: Field Study,Not mental health,"Kleschnitzki, JM; Grossmann, I; Beyer, R; Beyer, L",JMIR SERIOUS GAMES,2022,"Background: The pandemic has highlighted the importance of low-threshold opportunities for exercise and physical activity. At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to many restrictions, which affected seniors in care facilities in the form of severe isolation. The isolation led, among other things, to a lack of exercise, which has led to a multitude of negative effects for this target group. Serious games can potentially help by being used anywhere at any time to strengthen skills with few resources. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a serious game to strengthen motor skills (study 1) and the influence of pandemic restrictions (study 2) on seniors in care facilities. Methods: The data on motor skills (measured by the Tinetti test) originated from an intervention study with repeated measurements that was interrupted by the pandemic conditions. Data were collected 4 times every 3 months with an intervention group (IG, training 3 times for 1 hour per week) and a control group (CG, no intervention). There were 2 substudies. The first considered the first 6 months until the pandemic restrictions, while the second considered the influence of the restrictions on motor skills. Results: The sample size was 70. The IG comprised 31 (44%) participants, with 22 (71%) female and 9 (29%) male seniors with an average age of 85 years. The CG comprised 39 (56%) participants, with 31 (79%) female and 8 (21%) male seniors with an average age of 87 years. In study 1, mixed-design ANOVA showed no significant interaction between measurement times and group membership for the first measurements (F-2.136=1.414, P<.25, partial eta 2=.044), but there was a significant difference between the CG (mean 16.23, SD 1.1) and the IG (mean 19.81, SD 1.2) at the third time of measurement (P=.02). In study 2 the mixed-design ANOVA (used to investigate motor skills before and after the pandemic conditions between the 2 groups) couldn't reveal any significant interaction between measurement times and group membership: F-1.67=2.997, P<.09, partial eta 2=.043. However, there was a significant main effect of the time of measurement: F-1.67=5.44, P<.02, partial eta(2)=.075. Conclusions: During the first 6 months, the IG showed increased motor skills, whereas the motor skills of the CG slightly deteriorated and showed a statistically significant difference after 6 months. The pandemic restrictions leveled the difference and showed a significant negative effect on motor skills over 3 months. As our results show, digital games have the potential to break down access barriers and promote necessary maintenance for important skills. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of low-threshold opportunities for exercise and physical activity. This potentially great benefit for the challenges of tomorrow shows the relevance of the topic and demonstrates the urgent need for action and research.",10.2196/36768,wos,"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Informatics",serious games; motor skills; motor; long-term care; exercise; movement; coronavirus effects; eHealth; seniors; older adult; elder; senior population; aged; care home; intervention effects analysis; COVID-19; pandemic; digital game; digital health; physical activity,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/36768)
Money can't buy happiness: A randomized controlled trial of a digital mental health app with versus without financial incentives,Not Multi User,"Chang, CRY; Palermo, E; Deswert, S; Brown, A; Nuske, HJ",DIGITAL HEALTH,2023,"Mental health disorders are prevalent among college students and increasing in frequency and severity. However, there is a significant gap between those who need treatment and those who engage in treatment. Given the documented efficacy of financial incentives for promoting health behavior change and engagement in treatment, financial incentives may help, along with nonfinancial behavioral incentives such as motivational messaging, gamification, and loss aversion techniques. We compared brief (28-day) use of two versions of a behavioral economics-inspired digital mental health app, NeuroFlow: (1) the full app including financial incentives and nonfinancial behavioral incentives (treatment group) and (2) a version of the app with nonfinancial behavioral incentives only (control group). In our intent-to-treat analyses, in order to examine the primary outcome of app engagement, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (treatment vs. control) was conducted, and to examine the secondary outcomes (depression, anxiety, emotion dysregulation, and wellbeing), a two-way repeated measures ANOVAs (treatment vs. control x baseline vs. post-trial) were conducted. We found that there were no differences between treatment groups on app engagement or the change in the mental health/wellness outcome measures. There was a main effect of timepoint on symptoms of anxiety and emotion dysregulation, such that there were significantly lower self-reported symptoms at post-trial relative to baseline.

Qualitative data exploring the lived experiences of participants may be a unique way to develop hypotheses about the potential mechanisms driving change. The current study used qualitative and quantitative data from the ML for Graduate Students (ML-GS) and Young Adults (ML-YA) studies to generate hypotheses regarding potential mechanisms of changes experienced in ML. Seventy-nine graduate students and fifty-nine non-student young adults provided quantitative and qualitative feedback after participating in a 12-week virtual ML program. Inductive qualitative analysis was conducted within a reflexive thematic framework. Descriptive statistics of quantitative measures were also calculated. Three themes suggest potential directions for future mechanism research on virtual ML programs. Most participants emphasized the social connections built in groups as the most potent and powerful aspects of ML, while others focused on the design or content of the program. Quantitative data presented contextualize the lived experiences of participants.

These diseases are often multisystem, life-long and induce complex needs of patients and families. Multidisciplinary care involves all stages of disease management: diagnostics, specific or symptomatic, acute and chronic treatments, and integrated care that takes into account not only medical, but also manifold psychosocial, educational, vocational and other needs of patients and their caregivers. Care coordination is indispensable to ensure smooth transitions of care across life and disease stages, including management of emergencies, transition from pediatric to adult services and palliative care. Care pathways are highly diverse and have to find the right balance between highly specialized and locally provided services. While multidisciplinary teams consist of many professionals, a named supervising physician in a highly specialized healthcare setting and a care coordinator are highly important. As the greatest burden of care always falls onto the shoulders of patients and/or families, patient empowerment should be a part of every care pathway and include provision of required information, involvement into common decision-making, patient's and family's education, support for self-management, liaison with peer support groups and emotional/ psychological support. Due to the rarity and complexity of these diseases, sufficient expertise may not be available in a national healthcare system and cross-border services (virtual or physical) in the recently developed European Reference Networks should be ensured through the proper organization of referral systems in each EU and EEA country.

Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention program that measures associated variables such as catastrophizing, pain acceptance, and quality of life using a mobile device in people with chronic pain in an outpatient setting. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was performed using parallel treatment groups. A total of 209 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain were randomly assigned to one of the two study arms. The intervention group received a standard web-based psychosocial therapy-type program of activities through a smartphone for 6 weeks. The control group only had access to the Find out more section of the app, which contained audiovisual material for pain management based on a self-help approach The primary outcome was catastrophizing measured using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Secondary outcomes were pain acceptance measured using the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire and health-related quality of life measured using the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale. Assessments were conducted at baseline (T1), after treatment (T2), and at the 3-month follow-up (T3). The variations between the different phases were assessed using the percentage change rescaled with log base 2. The Cohen d was calculated based on the results of the linear mixed model. The investigators of the study who evaluated the results were not involved in patient recruitment and were blinded to the group assignment. Results: Positive effects were found in the intervention group (T2-T1) in catastrophizing between the baseline and posttreatment phases (P<.001) and in helplessness (-0.72 vs 0.1; P=.002), rumination (-1.59 vs -0.53; P<.001), acceptance (0.38 vs 0.05; P=.001), and quality of life (0.43 vs -0.01; P=.002), although no significant changes were found for magnification (0.2 vs 0.77; P=.14) and satisfaction with health (0.25 vs -0.27; P=.13).

This study aimed to 1) examine the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component home-based physical activity intervention delivered to mothers at risk of postnatal depression, and 2) examine changes in health behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, diet) and indicators of mental health. Methods: Sixty-two mothers (3 - 9 months postpartum) who at baseline were insufficiently active and experiencing heightened depressive symptoms were recruited into a 12-week randomised controlled trial in 2018. Participants were randomised into either a) Intervention group (receiving a theoretically underpinned multi component program including free exercise equipment at home, access to smartphone web-app, and an online forum); or b) Control group (usual routine). Primary outcomes were program feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included self-reported and accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior, sleep, diet, determinants of physical activity, and mental health (depressive and anxiety symptoms), measured at baseline and follow-up (12-weeks), with self-reported physical activity, sedentary behaviour and depressive symptoms also measured at weeks 4 and 8. Qualitative data was analysed following inductive content analysis, and quantitative data using linear mixed models. Results: Exercise equipment use in the home was shown to be a feasible strategy to re-engage postnatal women in physical activity. Other components of the program (e.g. web-app, online forum) had low compliance. The program had high acceptability, predominately due to its accessibility, flexibility and ability to overcome key barriers to physical activity. The program resulted in improvements in short-term self-reported physical activity (increased 162min/week at 4 weeks, 95% CI: 37.7, 286.2), behavioural skills (B = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.0, 0.8) and perceived barriers to physical activity. However, accelerometer measured physical activity decreased in the intervention group, compared to control group at week 12 (B = -1.3, 95% CI:-2.5, -0.1). There were no changes in other outcomes.

My Surgical Success: Effect of a Digital Behavioral Pain Medicine Intervention on Time to Opioid Cessation After Breast Cancer Surgery-A Pilot Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,Population,"Darnall, BD; Ziadni, MS; Krishnamurthy, P; Flood, P; Heathcote, LC; Mackey, IG; Taub, CJ; Wheeler, A",PAIN MEDICINE,2019,"Objective. This study aims to assess the feasibility of digital perioperative behavioral pain medicine intervention in breast cancer surgery and evaluate its impact on pain catastrophizing, pain, and opioid cessation after surgery. Design and Setting. A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA, USA) comparing a digital behavioral pain medicine intervention (My Surgical Success [MSS]) with digital general health education (HE). Participants. A convenience sample of 127 participants were randomized to treatment group. The analytic sample was 68 patients (N = 36 MSS, N = 32 HE). Main Outcomes. The primary outcome was feasibility and acceptability of a digital behavioral pain medicine intervention (80% threshold for acceptability items). Secondary outcomes were pain catastrophizing, past seven-day average pain intensity, and time to opioid cessation after surgery for patients who initiated opioid use. Results. The attrition rate for MSS intervention (44%) was notably higher than for HE controls (18%), but it was lower than typical attrition rates for e-health interventions (60-80%). Despite greater attrition for MSS, feasibility was demonstrated for the 56% of MSS engagers, and the 80% threshold for acceptability was met. We observed a floor effect for baseline pain catastrophizing, and no significant group differences were found for post-surgical pain catastrophizing or pain intensity. MSS was associated with 86% increased odds of opioid cessation within the 12-week study period relative to HE controls (hazard ratio = 1.86, 95% confidence interval = 1.12-3.10, P = 0.016). Conclusions. Fifty-six percent of patients assigned to MSS engaged with the online platform and reported high satisfaction. MSS was associated with significantly accelerated opioid cessation after surgery (five-day difference) with no difference in pain report relative to controls.

My cup of tea: Behaviour change intervention to promote use of reusable hot drink cups,Other,"Novoradovskaya, E; Mullan, B; Hasking, P; Uren, HV",JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,2021,"Globally approximately 16 billion paper coffee cups are being thrown away every year. One solution to this problem is using a reusable hot drink cup. We developed a behaviour change intervention to increase the use of reusable hot drink cups on an Australian University campus and evaluated its effectiveness; we also investigated the psychological mechanisms through which change happens; moreover, we extended the investigation on the previously established relationship between habit strength and intolerance of uncertainty. Participants (N = 156) from a large Australian University were randomly assigned to one of four intervention conditions: 1) an intervention aimed at evoking environmental values, 2) an intention-based intervention, 3) a habit-based intervention, and 4) a control group with no direct intervention to increase use of reusable cups. At baseline, participants in the three intervention groups received a new reusable hot drink cup, and completed a pre- and six-week post-intervention questionnaire assessing habit strength, intention to use a reusable cup, biospheric values, personal involvement and personal norms towards the environment, ecological worldview, and intolerance of uncertainty. The behaviour of using a reusable cup was recorded by participants using a phone app immediately after delivery of the intervention and at six-week follow-up. There was a significant increase in the use of reusable cups in all intervention conditions immediately after the intervention and after the six-week follow-up, compared to the control condition. The key mechanisms for behaviour change were similar between the intervention conditions, with groups increasing habit strength, especially if they had difficulty tolerating uncertainty. These findings offer suggestions for establishing habits in pro-environmental behaviour change interventions, as well as for tailoring habit-based interventions for those who are intolerant of uncertainty.

Natural Language Processing-Based Virtual Cofacilitator for Online Cancer Support Groups: Protocol for an Algorithm Development and Validation Study,Other,"Leung, YW; Wouterloot, E; Adikari, A; Hirst, G; de Silva, D; Wong, JH; Bender, JL; Gancarz, M; Gratzer, D; Alahakoon, D; Esplen, MJ",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2021,"Background: Cancer and its treatment can significantly impact the short-and long-term psychological well-being of patients and families. Emotional distress and depressive symptomatology are often associated with poor treatment adherence, reduced quality of life, and higher mortality. Cancer support groups, especially those led by health care professionals, provide a safe place for participants to discuss fear, normalize stress reactions, share solidarity, and learn about effective strategies to build resilience and enhance coping. However, in-person support groups may not always be accessible to individuals; geographic distance is one of the barriers for access, and compromised physical condition (eg, fatigue, pain) is another. Emerging evidence supports the effectiveness of online support groups in reducing access barriers. Text-based and professional-led online support groups have been offered by Cancer Chat Canada. Participants join the group discussion using text in real time. However, therapist leaders report some challenges leading text-based online support groups in the absence of visual cues, particularly in tracking participant distress. With multiple participants typing at the same time, the nuances of the text messages or red flags for distress can sometimes be missed. Recent advances in artificial intelligence such as deep learning-based natural language processing offer potential solutions. This technology can be used to analyze online support group text data to track participants' expressed emotional distress, including fear, sadness, and hopelessness. Artificial intelligence allows session activities to be monitored in real time and alerts the therapist to participant disengagement. Objective: We aim to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence-based cofacilitator prototype to track and monitor online support group participants' distress through real-time analysis of text-based messages posted during synchronous sessions. Methods: An artificial intelligence-based cofacilitator will be developed to identify participants who are at-risk for increased emotional distress and track participant engagement and in-session group cohesion levels, providing real-time alerts for therapist to follow-up; generate postsession participant profiles that contain discussion content keywords and emotion profiles for each session; and automatically suggest tailored resources to participants according to their needs. The study is designed to be conducted in 4 phases consisting of (1) development based on a subset of data and an existing natural language processing framework, (2) performance evaluation using human scoring, (3) beta testing, and (4) user experience evaluation. Results: This study received ethics approval in August 2019. Phase 1, development of an artificial intelligence-based cofacilitator, was completed in January 2020. As of December 2020, phase 2 is underway. The study is expected to be completed by September 2021.

Methods We interviewed staff from18 cancer wellness centers in Canada and the United States to assess if our attendance expectations were realistic. Then, from a total sample of non-users in 2008 (n = 67) and infrequent users (n = 67) at the Hope & Cope Wellness Centre in Montreal, we randomly selected individuals from each group who registered and never returned (n = 16), and those who registered and returned 1-3 times (n = 17). Telephone interviews were conducted using a brief questionnaire. We used a phenomenological approach to assess the meaning of attendance for the registrants. Results Both groups of participants described similar reasons for not attending such as health complications, scheduling conflicts, child care, language issues, and parking restrictions. However, non-users focused specifically on functional aspects such as administrative issues and scheduling, and distance from the centre, while infrequent users expressed more emotional disappointments such as feeling more depressed and inability to engage with others. Discussion Strategies are suggested to optimize service delivery for short-term attendees, including home-exercise programming, virtual support, outreach systems, and caregiving support. Information from other wellness centers in Canada and the United States revealed similar trends in attendance but also revealed a wide range of programs and systems of data recording.

Virtual reality (VR) is used to induce the drug cue reactivity. Previous studies reported significant frequency-specific neuronal abnormalities in patients with MUD during VR induction of drug craving. However, whether those patients exhibit neuronal abnormalities after VR induction that could serve as the treatment target remains unclear. Here, we used an integrated VR system for inducing drug related changes and investigated the neuronal abnormalities after VR exposure in patients. Fifteen patients with MUD and ten healthy subjects were recruited and exposed to drug-related VR environments. Resting-state EEG were recorded for 5 minutes twice-before and after VR and transformed to obtain the frequency-specific data. Three self-reported scales for measurement of the anxiety levels and impulsivity of participants were obtained after VR task. Statistical tests and machine learning methods were employed to reveal the differences between patients and healthy subjects. The result showed that patients with MUD and healthy subjects significantly differed in Theta, alpha, and gamma power changes after VR. These neuronal abnormalities in patients were associated with the self-reported behavioral scales, indicating impaired impulse control.

Nudging digital physical activity breaks for home studying of university students-A randomized controlled trial during the COVID-19 pandemic with daily activity measures,Not Multi User,"Teuber, M; Leyhr, D; Moll, J; Sudeck, G",FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING,2022,"University students are of particular public health interest because they are at high risk for physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors. In conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic, sedentariness and physical inactivity were reinforced, as the pandemic led to an increase in home studying. Physical activity (PA) breaks have been identified as promoting factors for university students' physical and mental health. Therefore, the present study explored an approach to nudge students to take PA breaks at home while studying. The purpose was to test the effectiveness of digital nudging for PA breaks for 10 days using a randomized intervention design during the COVID-19 pandemic. It included an intervention group who received daily digital motivational prompts for PA break videos and a minimal intervention control group who got low-level access to PA break videos via a one-time link sent to the media library. Using a sample of university students in the southwest of Germany (n = 57), two-level binary logistic regression models were calculated to predict daily participation in PA breaks during the intervention period depending on the nudging intervention, as well as previous participation in PA breaks, the general PA level of the subjects before the intervention, the time spent on PA and on home studying in a day, the kind of day during the intervention (weekday vs. weekend), and the students' age. Results revealed that the digital nudging intervention did not show any significant effect on the likelihood to participate in PA breaks on a given day (0.69 <= beta <= 0.75, p > 0.3). Instead, an individual-level effect revealed that the longer a student studied at home over the course of a day, the more likely he or she was to take a PA break (1.07 <= beta <= 1.11, p < 0.001). Current findings show that individual characteristics such as daily time spent on home studying, which can change over the course of the intervention phase, are relevant considerations within nudging intervention in university setting. This provides initial insights especially for digital PA breaks for students during home studying.",10.3389/fspor.2022.1024996,"pubmed, wos",Sport Sciences,physical activity breaks; digital nudging; home studying; university students; intervention; motivational prompts,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.1024996)

Older patients' use of technology for a post-discharge nutritional intervention - A mixed-methods feasibility study,Not Multi User,"Lindhardt, T; Nielsen, MH",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS,2017,"Background: Malnutrition is frequent in older people and a precursor for morbidity and hospitalisation; furthermore low intake and weight loss during and after hospitalisation is well-described. Such patients are often excluded from technology projects on account of lack of skills. This is a barrier for their access to many current and future health care offers. Objectives: To test the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of technology-supported energy-and protein-enforced homedelivered meals for older patients discharged from hospital. Design: Mixed method design including a quasi-experimental controlled feasibility trial and embedded qualitative interviews. Participants: Older medical patients (mean age 79.4 years; women 66.7%) at nutritional risk and discharged to own home were included consecutively to first the control group (n = 18) and later the intervention group (n = 18). Nine intervention and 16 control group patients completed the project. Methods: Intervention: group received: 1) enriched meals delivered to participants' homes 12 weeks after discharge, and 2) a tablet computer combining goal setting for intake with self-monitoring and feedback. Control group were treated as usual. Data collection was done at baseline, and at six and 12 weeks follow-up. Feasibility evaluation focused on 1) inclusion and retention and 2) acceptability and functionality of the intervention. Efficacy primary endpoint: Muscle strength and BMI. Secondary: Health related quality of life (HRQoL), depression; readmissions, mortality. Results: Technology challenges were related to immaturity of the out-of hospital app version; however, participants were motivated and capable of using the device. Inclusion and retention was challenged by the acceptability of the nutritional intervention and exhaustion among patients. Mortality was high. Although weaker at baseline the intervention group increased their muscle strength more consistently than did the control group: Handgrip strength with 2.5 kg vs 0.9 kg and chairto-stand-test with 3.3 vs. 1.8 times. They also improved their depression score and HRQoL more, and patients reported increased intake, appetite, and energy in the interviews. Relatives confirmed this and also reported positive impact on their level of worry and on the relationship with the older person. Conclusion: The study provided valuable insight into appropriate methods and procedures as well as older people's preferences and views on barriers to successful intervention and use of technology in health care. This will guide the design of a future sufficiently powered study. Effect evaluation provided guidance for future sample size calculation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Online Communities as a Driver for Patient Empowerment: Systematic Review,Good,"Johansson, V; Islind, AS; Lindroth, T; Angenete, E; Gellerstedt, M",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2021,"Background: The use of online resources has changed how people manage health care processes. Patients seek information about health conditions, guidance in treatment, and support from peers online, complementary to traditional health care trajectories. Online communities have the potential to contribute to the quality of care by increasing patient empowerment; however, there is a gap in research regarding in what way online communities contribute to patient empowerment. Objective: We synthesized research regarding how online communities contribute to patient empowerment to address the research question In what ways can participation in online communities support patient empowerment? by studying how patient empowerment is operationalized in different studies. The definition of patient empowerment used in this paper is enablement for people to develop mastery over actions and control over decisions that influence their lives. The mastery is both through processes and outcomes of the development. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching in the following databases: Scopus, ACM Digital Library, EBSCO (CINAHL and MEDLINE), PubMed, and Web of Science. In total, there were 1187 papers after excluding duplicates, and through selection processes using an analytical framework with definitions of patient empowerment and related concepts, 33 peer-reviewed papers were included. Results: Findings indicated that online communities support patient empowerment both as a process and as outcomes of these processes. Additionally, it was seen as a complement to traditional health care and encouragement for health care professionals to have a more positive attitude toward patients' usage.

Online Peer-to-Peer Support for Young People With Mental Health Problems: A Systematic Review,Other,"Ali, K; Farrer, L; Gulliver, A; Griffiths, KM",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2015,"Background: Adolescence and early adulthood are critical periods for the development of mental disorders. Online peer-to-peer communication is popular among young people and may improve mental health by providing social support. Previous systematic reviews have targeted Internet support groups for adults with mental health problems, including depression. However, there have been no systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of online peer-to-peer support in improving the mental health of adolescents and young adults. Objective: The aim of this review was to systematically identify available evidence for the effectiveness of online peer-to peer support for young people with mental health problems. Methods: The PubMed, PsycInfo, and Cochrane databases were searched using keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Retrieved abstracts (n=3934) were double screened and coded. Studies were included if they (1) investigated an online peer-to-peer interaction, (2) the interaction discussed topics related to mental health, (3) the age range of the sample was between 12 to 25 years, and (4) the study evaluated the effectiveness of the peer-to-peer interaction. Results: Six studies satisfied the inclusion criteria for the current review. The studies targeted a range of mental health problems including depression and anxiety (n=2), general psychological problems (n=1), eating disorders (n=1), and substance use (tobacco) (n=2). The majority of studies investigated Internet support groups (n=4), and the remaining studies focused on virtual reality chat sessions (n=2). In almost all studies (n=5), the peer support intervention was moderated by health professionals, researchers or consumers. Studies employed a range of study designs including randomized controlled trials (n=3), pre-post studies (n=2) and one randomized trial. Overall, two of the randomized controlled trials were associated with a significant positive outcome in comparison to the control group at post-intervention. In the remaining four studies, peer-to-peer support was not found to be effective. Conclusions: This systematic review identified an overall lack of high-quality studies examining online peer-to-peer support for young people. Given that peer support is frequently used as an adjunct to Internet interventions for a variety of mental health conditions, there is an urgent need to determine the effectiveness of peer support alone as an active intervention.",10.2196/mental.4418,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,mental health; Internet; young people; peer-to-peer support; Internet support groups; technology; systematic reviews,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/mental.4418)

Their direct link to functional outcome and illness status have made them an important therapeutic target. However, no effective treatment for these deficits is currently applied as a standard of care. To address this need, we have developed SocialVille-an online, plasticity-based training program that targets SC deficits in schizophrenia. Here we report the outcomes of a double-blind, controlled, randomized, multi-site clinical trial of SocialVille. Outpatients with schizophrenia were randomized to complete 40 sessions of either SocialVille (N = 55 completers) or active control (computer games; N = 53 completers) from home. The a priori co-primary outcome measures were a social cognitive composite and a functional capacity outcome (UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment [UPSA-2]). Secondary outcomes included a virtual functional capacity measure (VRFCAT), social functioning, quality of life, and motivation. Linear mixed models revealed a group x time interaction favoring the treatment group for the social cognitive composite (b = 2.81; P < .001) but not for the UPSA-2 measure. Analysis of secondary outcome measures showed significant group x time effects favoring the treatment group on SC and social functioning, on the virtual functional capacity measure and a motivation subscale, although these latter findings were nonsignificant with FDR correction. These results provide support for the efficacy of a remote, plasticity-based social cognitive training program in improving SC and social functioning in schizophrenia. Such treatments may serve as a cost-effective adjunct to existing psychosocial treatments.",10.1093/schbul/sbaa085,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,computerized; computer-based; treatment; e motion; SocialVille; TRuSST,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbaa085)
Online computer-aided vicarious exposure for OCD symptoms: A pilot study,Not Multi User,"Matthews, AJ; Maunder, R; Scanlan, JD; Kirkby, KC",JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY,2017,"Background and objectives: Computer-aided vicarious exposure (CAVE) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an intervention in which participants learn and rehearse exposure with response prevention (ERP) by directing a character around a virtual world. This study aimed to pilot an online CAVE program for OCD in a community sample with high OCD symptomatology. Methods: Participants (n = 78) were allocated to an intervention group (three 45-min weekly CAVE sessions) or to a waitlist control group. The treatment group were asked to complete three 45-min sessions over a four week period. Results: Those who completed at least one CAVE session showed greater improvement on measures of OCD symptomatology at one-month post-treatment (d = 0.49-0.81) compared to waitlist (d = 0.01-0.1). Older age, past treatment and higher symptom severity were associated with non-adherence. Limitations: These findings should be considered preliminary due to sample size limitations and an absence of an active control group. However, the findings suggest that further development and evaluation of the program is warranted. Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that online CAVE programs have potential to bridge treatment gaps among those reluctant to attend treatment or engage with in vivo exposure exercises. These programs may also have potential applications as an adjunct to face-to-face or online cognitive behavioural therapy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Online group music therapy: proactive management of undergraduate students' stress and anxiety,Good,"Finnerty, R; McWeeny, S; Trainor, L",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2023,"IntroductionIn alignment with the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal to provide comprehensive and integrated mental health services in community-based settings, this randomized control trial explored the efficacy of online group music therapy as a proactive intervention for reducing stress and anxiety in university students who do not necessarily have a diagnosis. MethodsThe study took place during COVID-19 restrictions. Students who volunteered were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of weekly (1) online active group music therapy, (2) online receptive group music therapy, (3) online group verbal therapy (standard of care), or (4) no-intervention (control group). Students rated their stress (Likert scale) and anxiety [State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, State version (STAI-S)], and provided heart rate variability (HRV) using a phone app, pre and post each therapy session. ResultsSTAI-S and Likert stress scores significantly reduced from pre to post 45-min online music therapy sessions, with moderate evidence that these changes did not differ from the standard of care (verbal therapy). HRV results were not analyzed statistically as HRV collection was likely compromised due to challenges of remote collection. Students completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and provided a hair sample for cortisol analysis before and after the 6-week intervention. Changes in stress from week 1 to week 6 were not observed in the PSS measure; however, cortisol increased significantly in the control group as the term progressed, while it remained relatively stable in the therapy groups, suggesting therapy may lead to greater control of stress. Of participants' demographic characteristics, music sophistication, personality, and changes in quality of life, only the personality trait of conscientiousness correlated significantly with PSS, suggesting online group therapy may be beneficial for a wide range of university students. DiscussionThe results suggest group music therapy can be as effective as group verbal therapy. Further, the study indicates that online delivery can be achieved effectively, supporting the idea that remote therapy may be a viable option for other populations. While the study should be replicated with a larger multi-site sample, it provides one example toward achieving a health-promoting culture on university campuses, consistent with the mental health goals of the Okanagan Charter.",10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1183311,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,mental health; music therapy; stress; anxiety; proactive therapy; cortisol; university students; online group therapy,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1183311)
Online psychoeducation and digital assessments as a first step of treatment for borderline personality disorder: A protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial,Not Digital,"Choi-Kain, LW; Murray, GE; Jurist, J; Ren, BY; Germine, L",PLOS ONE,2023,"BackgroundTreatment trials for borderline personality disorder (BPD) have consistently demonstrated that approaches that are diagnostically tailored are superior to those which are not. Currently, gold standard treatments for BPD are highly intensive, lengthy, and specialized, leading to a critical gap between the supply and demand of effective, evidence-based treatment for patients who receive a diagnosis of BPD. Psychoeducation, which is a common component of most treatments known to be effective, is a low-cost, low-burden intervention proven to relieve symptoms. The present study builds on psychoeducation research, assessing online video prescriptions as a means of disseminating information patients need to know about their diagnosis and care.MethodsThis article presents the study protocol for a safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy trial of psychoeducational video prescriptions and online assessment with feedback for newly diagnosed individuals with BPD. We aim to recruit 100 adults recently diagnosed with BPD to be randomly assigned to receive videos about BPD or videos about non-BPD mental health topics that are matched in length in the first step of the study. All participants will complete daily surveys about their emotions, interpersonal interactions, and behaviors, as well as self-report assessments and cognitive tests at 4 different time points. Half of the participants in the intervention group will receive feedback on their symptom ratings and cognitive test performance to assess whether there is incremental value in tailoring this online set of interventions with individualized feedback unique to each participant. This study aims to assess the effects of BPD-focused psychoeducational videos with and without personalized feedback, on BPD and depressive symptom severity as well as core mechanisms of the disorder such as loneliness, rejection sensitivity, cognitive control difficulties, and self-clarity.

Participants were individually randomised (1 : 1), using on online system, with block randomisations, stratified by site. Naturalistic follow-up was conducted at 12 and 18 months post-randomisation when participants were free to access non-trial interventions. A subset of participants participated in a process evaluation.Setting: Two hospitals (London and Nottingham) in England also accepting referrals from patient identification centres and online self-referrals.Participants: Children aged 9-17 years (1) with Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder, (2) with a Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-total tic severity score of 15 or more (or > 10 with only motor or vocal tics) and (3) having not received behavioural therapy for tics in the past 12 months or started/stopped medication for tics within the past 2 months.Interventions: Either 10 weeks of online, remotely delivered, therapist-supported exposure and response prevention therapy (intervention group) or online psychoeducation (control).Outcome: Primary outcome: Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-total tic severity score 3 months post-randomisation; analysis done in all randomised patients for whom data were available. Secondary outcomes included low mood, anxiety, treatment satisfaction and health resource use. Quality-adjusted life-years are derived from parent-completed quality-of-life measures.

Online video game therapy for mental health concerns: A review,Good,"Wilkinson, N; Ang, RP; Goh, DH",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY,2008,"Background: There has been research on the use of offline video games for therapeutic purposes but online video game therapy is still fairly under-researched. Online therapeutic interventions have only recently included a gaming component. Hence, this review represents a timely first step toward taking advantage of these recent technological and cultural innovations, particularly for the treatment of special-needs groups such as the young, the elderly and people with various conditions such as ADHD, anxiety and autism spectrum disorders. Material: A review integrating research findings on two technological advances was conducted: the home computer boom of the 1980s, which triggered a flood of research on therapeutic video games for the treatment of various mental health conditions; and the rise of the internet in the 1990s, which caused computers to be seen as conduits for therapeutic interaction rather than replacements for the therapist. Discussion: We discuss how video games and the internet can now be combined in therapeutic interventions, as attested by a consideration of pioneering studies. Conclusion: Future research into online video game therapy for mental health concerns might focus on two broad types of game: simple society games, which are accessible and enjoyable to players of all ages, and online worlds, which offer a unique opportunity for narrative content and immersive remote interaction with therapists and fellow patients. Both genres might be used for assessment and training purposes, and provide an unlimited platform for social interaction.

Opening the Conversation: study protocol for a Phase III trial to evaluate a couple-based intervention to reduce reproductive and sexual distress among young adult breast and gynecologic cancer survivor couples,Good,"Gorman, JR; Lyons, KS; Harvey, SM; Acquati, C; Salsman, JM; Kashy, DA; Drizin, JH; Smith, E; Flexner, LM; Hayes-Lattin, B; Reese, JB",TRIALS,2022,"Background: Reproductive and sexual health (RSH) concerns are common and distressing for young adults diagnosed with breast and gynecologic cancer and their partners. This study evaluates the efficacy of a virtual couple-based intervention called Opening the Conversation (OC). The OC intervention is grounded in theory and evidence-based practice and was adapted to improve coping and communication specifically in relation to RSH concerns after cancer. Methods: This Phase III trial is conducted in a fully remote setting and enrolls young adult couples (current age 18-44 years) with a history of breast or gynecologic cancer (stage 1-4, diagnosed under age 40) within the past 6 months to 5 years. Eligible dyads are recruited from across the USA. The target sample size is 100 couples. Dyads are randomly assigned to receive either the 5-session OC intervention or a 4-session active control intervention (Side by Side). The primary outcomes are change in reproductive distress and sexual distress. Secondary outcomes include communication about reproductive concerns, communication about sexual concerns, depressive symptoms, sexual function, relationship quality, relationship intimacy, sexual satisfaction, self-efficacy to communicate about sex and intimacy, and quality of life. An exploratory aim examines whether dyadic coping and communication quality mediate intervention effects on survivors'and partners' reproductive distress or sexual distress. Self-report outcome measures are assessed for both groups at baseline (T1), 2 weeks post-treatment (T2), and 3 months post-treatment (T3). Discussion: Despite the importance of RSH for quality of life for young adult cancer survivors and their partners, evidence-based interventions that help couples navigate RSH concerns are lacking.

Objective: To describe the methods of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) being conducted to compare PCplanner vs. usual care. Methods and analysis: The goal of this two-arm, parallel group mixed methods RCT is to determine the clinical impact of the PCplanner intervention on outcomes of interest to patients, family members, clinicians, and policymakers over a 3-month follow up period.

Optimising symptom management in children with cancer using a novel mobile phone application: protocol for a controlled hybrid effectiveness implementation trial (RESPONSE),Not Multi User,"Bradford, N; Condon, P; Pitt, E; Tyack, Z; Alexander, K",BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,2021,"Background: Intense and aggressive treatment regimens for most children's cancer have achieved vast improvements in survival but are also responsible for both a high number and burden of symptoms. The use of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) demonstrates a range of benefits for improved symptom management in adults with cancer. There are, however, multiple barriers to integrating PROMs into routine care in children and adolescents with cancer. This study aims to evaluate: (1) the effectiveness of electronic PROMs to generate stratified alerts, symptom management recommendations and graphical summaries (the RESPONSE system) to improve health outcomes and (2) the implementation of the RESPONSE system by assessing feasibility, acceptability, satisfaction, and sustainability. Methods: A pragmatic hybrid II effectiveness-implementation controlled trial, using mixed methods, will be undertaken, advancing both knowledge of the effectiveness of the intervention and implementation factors. One-hundred and sixty children with cancer receiving active treatment will be recruited 1:1 to a non-randomised study involving two groups with an equal number of participants in each group.

Optimizing Pediatric Induction Experiences Using Human-centered Design,Other,"Winterberg, AV; Lane, B; Hill, LM; Varughese, AM",JOURNAL OF PERIANESTHESIA NURSING,2022,"Purpose: Anesthesia inhalation induction (falling asleep for a surgery using a medical mask) is often stressful for children. When children become anxious about induction, they may resist wearing the anesthesia mask. High anxiety during induction is associated with poorer outcomes after surgery, such as increased emergence delirium, increased pain and negative behavioral changes after discharge. The purpose of this project was to design an optimal anesthesia induction experience for children, with a focus on decreasing patient anxiety during inhalation induction. Design: Designing for the perioperative environment requires in-depth knowledge of existing processes, needs of key stakeholders, strengths/shortcomings of existing approaches, and iterative testing of design concepts. We used a human centered design model (design research) to approach this challenge. Methods: Hospital staff partnered with a design team at the Live Well Collaborative. Families and staff were consulted during all phases of the design process. The iterative design research process (research, ideation, refinement) was used to develop product and process concepts for optimizing the induction experience. Requirements for an optimal induction experience were defined during the research phase through reviewing the scientific literature, process mapping and benchmarking with other products. Product and process concepts were developed during the ideation phase. Concepts were tested and refined during the refinement phase. Findings: The research phase provided insights about the current anesthesia induction process and what interventions help engage children in medical care. Key insights included normalizing the anesthesia mask through medical play, providing patients with an increased sense of control preoperatively and during induction, and engaging multiple senses during the process. The ideation phase led to the development of several design concepts, including an app that is activated by breathing into the anesthesia mask. During the refinement phase, concepts were shared and refined with input from families and clinical staff. This phase led to the development of a novel zoo-themed gaming app. Conclusions: The design research process facilitated the creation of a new anxiety reduction tool for the perioperative environment. The breath-controlled induction app simultaneously employs multiple evidencebased anxiety reduction techniques and is designed to seamlessly integrate into the fast-paced perioperative workflow during key stress points. Testing in the clinical setting is needed to determine the effectiveness of the app for preoperative anxiety reduction. (c) 2021 American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Optimizing laparoscopic training efficacy by 'deconstruction into key steps': a randomized controlled trial with novice medical students,Not Multi User,"Widder, A; Backhaus, J; Wierlemann, A; Hering, I; Flemming, S; Hankir, M; Germer, CT; Wiegering, A; Lock, JF; König, S; Seyfried, F",SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES,2022,"Background Simulator training is an effective way of acquiring laparoscopic skills but there remains a need to optimize teaching methods to accelerate learning. We evaluated the effect of the mental exercise 'deconstruction into key steps' (DIKS) on the time required to acquire laparoscopic skills. Methods A randomized controlled trial with undergraduate medical students was implemented into a structured curricular laparoscopic training course. The intervention group (IG) was trained using the DIKS approach, while the control group (CG) underwent the standard course. Laparoscopic performance of all participants was video-recorded at baseline (t(0)), after the first session (t(1)) and after the second session (t(2)) nine days later. Two double-blinded raters assessed the videos. The Impact of potential covariates on performance (gender, age, prior laparoscopic experience, self-assessed motivation and self-assessed dexterity) was evaluated with a self-report questionnaire. Results Both the IG (n = 58) and the CG (n = 68) improved their performance after each training session (p < 0.001) but with notable differences between sessions. Whereas the CG significantly improved their performance from t(0 )-t(1) (p < 0.05), DIKS shortened practical exercise time by 58% so that the IG outperformed the CG from t(1 )-t(2), (p < 0.05). High self-assessed motivation and dexterity associated with significantly better performance (p < 0.05). Male participants demonstrated significantly higher overall performance (p < 0.05). Conclusion Mental exercises like DIKS can improve laparoscopic performance and shorten practice times. Given the limited exposure of surgical residents to simulator training, implementation of mental exercises like DIKS is highly recommended.

Original Paper Uptake of an App-Based Case Management Service for HIV-Positive Men Who Have Sex With Men in China: Process Evaluation Study,Other,"Fan, XY; Ning, K; Liu, C; Zhong, HD; Lau, JTF; Hao, C; Hao, YT; Li, JH; Li, LH; Gu, J",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in China are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic, and medication adherence to antiretroviral treatment in this vulnerable population is suboptimal. To address this issue, we developed an app-based case management service with multiple components, informed by the Information Motivation Behavioral skills model. Objective: We aimed to conduct a process evaluation for the implementation of an innovative app-based intervention guided by the Linnan and Steckler framework. Methods: Process evaluation was performed alongside a randomized controlled trial in the largest HIV clinic in Guangzhou, China. Eligible participants were HIV-positive MSM aged >= 18 years planning to initiate treatment on the day of recruitment. The app-based intervention had 4 components: web-based communication with case managers, educational articles, supportive service information (eg, information on mental health care and rehabilitation service), and hospital visit reminders. Process evaluation indicators of the intervention include dose delivered, dose received, fidelity, and satisfaction. The behavioral outcome was adherence to antiretroviral treatment at month 1, and Information Motivation Behavioral skills model scores were the intermediate outcome. Logistic and linear regression was used to investigate the association between intervention uptake and outcomes, controlling for potential confounders. Results: A total of 344 MSM were recruited from March 19, 2019, to January 13, 2020, and 172 were randomized to the intervention group. At month 1 follow-up, there was no significant difference in the proportion of adherent participants between the intervention and control groups (66/144, 45.8% vs 57/134, 42.5%; P=.28). In the intervention group, 120 participants engaged in web-based communication with case managers and 158 accessed at least 1 of the delivered articles. The primary concern captured in the web-based conversation was the side effects of the medication (114/374, 30.5%), which was also one of the most popular educational articles topics. The majority (124/144, 86.1%) of participants that completed the month 1 survey rated the intervention as very helpful or helpful. The number of educational articles accessed was associated with adequate adherence in the intervention group (odds ratio 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.15; P=.009). The intervention also improved the motivation score after adjusting for baseline values (beta=2.34, 95% CI 0.77-3.91; P=.004). However, the number of web-based conversations, regardless of conversation features, was associated with lower motivation scores in the intervention group. Conclusions: The intervention was well-received. Delivering educational resources of interest may enhance medication adherence.

Outcome Expectancy as a Predictor of Treatment Response in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Public Speaking Fears Within Social Anxiety Disorder,Not Multi User,"Price, M; Anderson, PL",PSYCHOTHERAPY,2012,"Outcome expectancy, the extent that clients anticipate benefiting from therapy, is theorized to be an important predictor of treatment response for cognitive-behavioral therapy. However, there is a relatively small body of empirical research on outcome expectancy and the treatment of social anxiety disorder. This literature, which has examined the association mostly in group-based interventions, has yielded mixed findings. The current study sought to further evaluate the effect of outcome expectancy as a predictor of treatment response for public-speaking fears across both individual virtual reality and group-based cognitive-behavioral therapies. The findings supported outcome expectancy as a predictor of the rate of change in public-speaking anxiety during both individual virtual reality exposure therapy and group cognitive-behavioral therapy.

PROTOCOL: Technology-based and digital interventions for intimate partner violence: A meta-analysis and systematic review,Not mental health,"Emezue, C; Bloom, TL",CAMPBELL SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,2021,"Introduction Studies show digital interventions such as mobile and wireless platforms (e.g., smartphone apps, text messaging) and web-based platforms (online support groups and telehealth services) can improve the mental health outcomes for victims/survivors of partner abuse. Depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety are three to five times higher among victims than nonvictims and are thus popular targets of digital interventions. Even then, the evidence is scant. The current review uses both narrative and quantitative (meta-analysis) techniques to present extensive evidence on the effects of intimate partner violence (IPV) digital interventions on the mental health outcomes among survivors of partner violence across all genders and ages, specifically, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. This is the first meta-analysis on IPV-related mental health outcomes targeted by digital interventions. Objectives To synthesize current evidence on the intervention and treatment effects of digital and technology-based interventions (mHealth and eHealth) addressing IPV mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, and PTSD) among survivors of IPV. This study's research questions are as follows: (a) What are the overall average treatment effects of IPV digital interventions on IPV survivors' mental health outcomes? (b) Do these mental health outcomes vary based on methodological study designs, sample characteristics, and intervention characteristics? Methods An extensive search strategy will be utilized to find qualifying studies. Various electronic bibliographic databases will be searched for studies since 2009 (coinciding with the onset of mobile health interventions). Other databases, such as government databases, grey literature databases, trial registers, specialty journals, and citations in other studies will be searched. Also, we will search grey databases, such as Google Scholar. Ethical and safety concerns preclude the randomization of IPV survivors to specific intervention conditions. Therefore, we will not exclude studies based on a lack of random assignment. Studies will be full-text accessible, published in any language (translatable into English). We will also contact researchers where needed data is missing in their report. Neither language, study location, nor study settings will be a limiter for searches. Keyword and MeSH headings will be used. Effect sizes (Hedges' g) will be estimated with a Type I error rate set at an alpha of .05. Results All studies will measure IPV-related mental health as an outcome and provide outcome data to calculate effect sizes for PTSD, anxiety, depression, and victimization (physical, psychological, and sexual violence). Conclusion Digital interventions may clinically reduce depression, anxiety, PTSD, and IPV victimization. Summary effect sizes ranging from small to large will signal the usefulness of digital interventions to IPV survivors contending with common mental health issues. Future studies beyond this one may identify other active intervention ingredients of digital interventions, best modes of delivery, and guidelines to increase their feasibility and acceptability.",10.1002/cl2.1132,"pubmed, wos",Social Sciences - Other Topics,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1002/cl2.1132)
"PTSD Coach Online-Arabic: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial to Examine Feasibility, Acceptability, and Preliminary Effectiveness",Not Multi User,"Miller-Graff, L; Ellis, K; Hosny, N",JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS,2021,"The Egyptian Revolution of 2011 resulted in high-level exposure to sociopolitical violence, placing a large burden on the mental health care system that cannot be effectively met given the small number of available providers in Egypt. We conducted a nonblinded, randomized controlled pilot trial of an online, self-directed tool for managing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the PTSD Coach Online-Arabic. Trauma-exposed Egyptian adults with clinically significant PTSS (N = 87; intervention group: n = 41) completed assessments at baseline, weekly over the treatment period, posttest, and 3-month follow-up. Of participants who completed weekly surveys, 88.9% used the program; 22.0% of participants reported regular, weekly use. Most tools received good likeability and perceived benefit scores, but lower perceived benefit scores on three tools suggest that some content may require additional adaptation. Intent-to-treat analyses using multilevel modeling with multiple imputation to account for missing data were conducted. Effect sizes for PTSS were below the cutoff for small effects at posttest, d = -0.14, but demonstrated a small positive effect at 3-months, d = -0.25. There was a small positive effect of treatment on anxiety at posttest, d = -0.37, and a medium effect at 3-month follow-up, d = -0.49. Treatment effects for depressed mood were below the cutoff for small effects at posttest and 3-months, ds = -0.14 and -0.18.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend a comprehensive and multimodal approach for management of cancer pain. We developed a mobile phone application, ePAL, based on clinical guidelines to empower patients for cancer pain management by prompting regular pain assessments and coaching for self-management. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a multidimensional mobile phone-based pain management application, ePAL, on controlling cancer pain and improving quality of life in patients with cancer pain being treated at an academic palliative care clinic. Methods: The study will be implemented as a 2-arm randomized controlled trial with 110 adult patients with CP who own a mobile phone over a follow-up period of two months. Participants will be randomized to either the intervention group receiving ePAL and usual care or to a control group receiving only usual care. The brief pain inventory will be used to assess our primary outcome which is pain intensity. We will also evaluate the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes which include the effect of the intervention on hospital utilization for pain crisis, quality of life, adherence to analgesic medications, barriers to pain control, anxiety and patient engagement. Instruments that will be used in evaluating secondary outcomes include the Brief Pain Inventory, Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, Barriers Questionnaire-II, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue. The intention-to-treat approach will be used to evaluate outcomes. Our primary outcome, pain intensity, measured longitudinally over eight weeks, will be assessed by mixed model repeated analysis. Effect sizes will be calculated as mean group differences with standard deviations. Results: The study is still in progress. We hope to have results by the end of 2015.

Palmtop computer-assisted group therapy for social phobia,Good,"Przeworski, A; Newman, MG",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY,2004,"This article describes the application of group computer-assisted therapy for social phobia. The computer program includes a diary function for ongoing self-monitoring of anxiety as well as guidance on the practice of relaxation, cognitive restructuring, and self-control desensitization. Although the program was originally designed to treat individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), it was hypothesized that the program also would be effective for individuals with social phobia: therefore, it was implemented in a group of individuals with a primary diagnosis of GAD or social phobia. We present the case of a client with social phobia who received six sessions of group therapy and who carried the ambulatory computer throughout this treatment. Outcome data suggest that the treatment was highly effective for this client as well as others with a diagnosis of social phobia or GAD.

"Parent Use and Efficacy of a Self-Administered, Tablet-Based Parent Training Intervention: A Randomized Controlled Trial",Not Multi User,"Breitenstein, SM; Fogg, L; Ocampo, EV; Acosta, DI; Gross, D",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2016,"Background: Parent training programs are traditionally delivered in face-to-face formats and require trained facilitators and weekly parent attendance. Implementing face-to-face sessions is challenging in busy primary care settings and many barriers exist for parents to attend these sessions. Tablet-based delivery of parent training offers an alternative to face-to-face delivery to make parent training programs easier to deliver in primary care settings and more convenient and accessible to parents. We adapted the group-based Chicago Parent Program (CPP) to be delivered as a self-administered, tablet-based program called the ezPARENT program. Objective: The purpose of this study was to (1) assess the feasibility of the ezPARENT program by examining parent satisfaction with the program and the percent of modules completed, (2) test the efficacy of the ezPARENT program by examining the effects compared with a control condition for improving parenting and child behavior in a sample of low-income ethnic minority parents of young children recruited from a primary care setting, and (3) compare program completion and efficacy with prior studies of the group-based CPP. Methods: The study used a two-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated measures follow up. Subjects (n=79) were randomly assigned to an intervention or attention control condition. Data collection was at baseline and 12 and 24 weeks post baseline. Parents were recruited from a large, urban, primary care pediatric clinic. ezPARENT module completion was calculated as the percentage of the six modules completed by the intervention group parents. Attendance in the group-based CPP was calculated as the percentage of attendance at sessions 1 through 10. Satisfaction data were summarized using item frequencies. Parent and child data were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) with simple contrasts to determine if there were significant intervention effects on the outcome measures. Effect sizes for between group comparisons were calculated for all outcome variables and compared with CPP group based archival data. Results: ezPARENT module completion rate was 85.4% (34.2/40; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 78.4%-93.7%) and was significantly greater (P<.05) than face-to-face CPP group attendance (135.2/267, 50.6%) attendance of sessions; 95% CI = 46.8%-55.6%). ezPARENT participants reported the program as very helpful (35/40, 88.0%) and they would highly recommend the program (33/40, 82.1%) to another parent. ezPARENT participants showed greater improvements in parenting warmth (F1,77 = 4.82, P<.05) from time 1 to 3. No other significant differences were found. Cohen's d effect sizes for intervention group improvements in parenting warmth, use of corporal punishment, follow through, parenting stress, and intensity of child behavior problems were comparable or greater than those of the group-based CPP. Conclusions: Data from this study indicate the feasibility and acceptability of the ezPARENT program in a low-income, ethnic minority population of parents and comparable effect sizes with face-to-face delivery for parents.",10.2196/mhealth.5202,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,Internet; intervention; mobile app; mobile health; parenting; prevention,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/mhealth.5202)
Patient Experiences Using a Self-Monitoring App in Eating Disorder Treatment: Qualitative Study,Not Multi User,"Lindgreen, P; Lomborg, K; Clausen, L",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2018,"Background: The Recovery Record smartphone app is a self-monitoring tool for individuals recovering from an eating disorder. Unlike traditional pen-and-paper meal diaries, which are often used in eating disorder treatment, the app holds novel features, such as meal reminders, affirmations, and patient-clinician in-app linkage, the latter allowing for clinicians to continuously monitor patients' app data. Objective: To explore patients' experiences with using Recovery Record as part of outpatient eating disorder treatment. Methods: A total of 41 patients from a Danish eating disorder treatment facility were included in the study. All 41 patients participated in participant observations of individual or group treatment sessions, and 26 were interviewed about their experiences with using the app in treatment. The data material was generated and analyzed concurrently, applying the inductive methodology of Interpretive Description. Results: The patients' experiences with Recovery Record depended on its app features, the impact of these features on patients, and their specific app usage. This patient-app interaction affected and was affected by changeable contexts making patients' experiences dynamic The patient-app interaction affected patients' placement of specific Recovery Record app features along a continuum from supportive to obstructive of individual everyday life activities including the eating disorder treatment. As an example, some patients found it supportive being notified by their clinician when their logs had been monitored as it gave them a sense of relatedness. Contrarily, other patients felt under surveillance, which was obstructive, as it made them feel uneasy or even dismissing the app. Conclusions: Some patients experienced the app and its features as mostly supportive of their everyday life and the eating disorder treatment, while others experienced it primarily as obstructive. When applying apps in eating disorder treatment, we therefore recommend that patients and clinicians collaborate to determine how the app in question best fits the capacities, preferences, and treatment needs of the individual patient. Thus, we encourage patients and clinicians to discuss how specific features of the applied app affect the individual patient to increase the use of supportive features, while limiting the use of obstructive ones.",10.2196/10253,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,feeding and eating disorders; anorexia nervosa; bulimia nervosa; mental health; psychiatry; mHealth; mobile applications; self-monitoring; blended treatment; eating disorder treatment,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/10253)
Patient Frustration with Pelvic Organ Prolapse Education Met with Resilient Response,Not mental health,"Corley, EM; Terse, P; Paulosky, KE; Karsalia, M; Nemirovsky, A; Malik, RD",NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS,2022,"Introduction Limited patient understanding due to challenges in physician-patient communication and inadequate patient education materials (PEMs) can result in poor outcomes after pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repair. Our objective was to identify how patients learned about POP and review their perception of available educational tools. Methods Patients with a history of POP were recruited using ResearchMatch and invited to participate in a virtual semi-structured interview where they were shown a website, brochure, and video pertaining to POP. Information regarding patient preference for PEMs was obtained. The interviews were transcribed, coded, and qualitative data analysis was performed using grounded theory methodology. Results Qualitative analysis of interviews of 13 participants averaging 58 years old yielded several preliminary themes including: insufficient information to guide treatment decisions, preference for multimodal, dynamic, and comprehensive materials, and lack of support leading to avoidance of care, misinformation, and self-advocacy mechanisms. Emerging concepts included: lack of complete information regarding POP treatment resulted in misinformation, stress and desperation, distrust of healthcare providers leading to feelings of isolation, desire of support groups, and loss of follow up, and a desire for well-organized, detailed, multimodal, and destigmatizing materials as a guide to their disease process, prevention and risk factors, its natural progression, and treatment decisions. Participants developed self-reliant strategies for making treatment decisions, including the use of online resources, advice from friends, and independent search for more specialized physicians. Conclusions Women with POP reported a lack of information and support which resulted in the generation of self-coping mechanisms. This led to significant anxiety surrounding their diagnosis and treatment and poor satisfaction. Developing a reproducible methodology to create evidence-based PEMs will significantly decrease patient misinformation, apprehension, and use of inaccurate sources of information.",10.1002/nau.24837,"pubmed, wos",Urology & Nephrology,patient education materials; pelvic organ prolapse; self-advocacy,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1002/nau.24837)
"Patient experiences of fertility clinic closure during the COVID-19 pandemic: appraisals,coping and emotions",Other,"Boivin, J; Harrison, C; Mathur, R; Burns, G; Pericleous-Smith, A; Gameiro, S",HUMAN REPRODUCTION,2020,"STUDY QUESTION: What are appraisals, coping strategies and emotional reactions of patients to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fertility clinic closures? SUMMARY ANSWER: Clinic closure was appraised as stressful due to uncertainty and threat to the attainability of the parenthood goal but patients were able to cope using strategies that fit the uncertainty of the situation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Psychological research on COVID-19 suggests that people are more anxious than historical norms and moderately to extremely upset about fertility treatment cancellation owing to COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was of cross-sectional design, comprising a mixed-methods, English language, anonymous, online survey posted from April 9 to 21 to social media. Eligibility criteria were being affected by COVID-19 fertility clinic closure, 18 years of age or older and able to complete the survey in English. In total, 946 people clicked on the survey link, 76 did not consent, 420 started but did not complete the survey and 450 completed (48% completion, 446 women, four men). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Overall 74.7% (n = 336) of respondents were residents in the UK with an average age of 33.6 years (SD = 4.4) and average years trying to conceive, 3.5 years (SD = 2.22). The survey comprised quantitative questions about the intensity of cognitive appraisals and emotions about clinic closure, and ability to cope with clinic closure. Open-text questions covered their understanding of COVID-19 and its effect on reproductive health and fertility plans, concerns and perceived benefits of clinic closure, and knowledge about closure. Sociodemographic information was collected. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used on quantitative data. Thematic qualitative analysis (inductive coding) was performed on the textual data from each question. Deductive coding grouped themes from each question into meta-themes related to cognitive stress and coping theory. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Most patients (81.6%, n = 367) had tests or treatments postponed, with these being self (41.3%, n = 186) or publicly (46.4%, n = 209) funded. Patients appraised fertility clinic closure as having potential for a more negative than positive impact on their lives, and to be very or extremely uncontrollable and stressful (P <= 0.001). Most reported a slight to moderate ability to cope with closure. Data saturation was achieved with all open-text questions, with 33 broad themes identified and four meta-themes linked to components of the cognitive stress and coping theory. First, participants understood clinic closure was precautionary due to unknown effects of COVID-19 but some felt clinic closure was unfair relative to advice about getting pregnant given to the public. Second, closure was appraised as a threat to attainability of the parenthood goal largely due to uncertainty of the situation (e.g. re-opening, effect of delay) and intensification of pre-existing hardships of fertility problems (e.g. long time waiting for treatment, history of failed treatment). Third, closure taxed personal coping resources but most were able to cope using thought-management (e.g. distraction, focusing on positives), getting mentally and physically fit for next treatments, strengthening their social network, and keeping up-to-date. Finally, participants reported more negative than positive emotions (P <= 0.001) and, almost all participants reported stress, worry and frustration at the situation, while some expressed anger and resentment at the unfairness of the situation. Overall, 11.8% were not at all able to cope, with reports of intense feelings of hopelessness and deteriorating well-being and mental health. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The survey captures patient reactions at a specific point in time, during lockdown and before clinics announced re-opening. Participants were self-selected (e.g. UK residents, women, 48% starting but not completing the survey), which may affect generalisability. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Fertility stakeholders (e.g. clinics, patient support groups, regulators, professional societies) need to work together to address the great uncertainty from COVID-19. This goal can be met proactively by setting up transparent processes for COVID-19 eventualities and signposting to information and coping resources. Future psychological research priorities should be on identifying patients at risk of distress with standardised measures and developing digital technologies appropriate for the realities of fertility care under COVID-19.",10.1093/humrep/deaa218,"pubmed, wos",Obstetrics & Gynecology; Reproductive Biology,COVID-19; coronavirus disease 2019; infertility; stress and coping; appraisal; mental health; counselling psychology; communication,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1093/humrep/deaa218)
Patient satisfaction with partial hospital telehealth treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic: Comparison to in-person treatment,Not Multi User,"Zimmerman, M; Benjamin, I; Tirpak, JW; D'Avanzato, C",PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH,2021,"Most research evaluating telehealth psychiatric treatment has been conducted in outpatient settings. There is a lack of research assessing the efficacy of telehealth treatment in more acute, intensive treatment settings such as a partial hospital. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of ambulatory behavioral health treatment has transitioned to a telehealth, or virtual, format. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we compared patient satisfaction of partial hospital services delivered via telehealth to in-person treatment provided to patients treated prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. The sample included 240 patients who were treated virtually from May, 2020 to October, 2020, and a comparison group of 240 patients who were treated in the in-person partial program a year earlier. Patients completed self-administered measures of patient satisfaction after the initial evaluation and at the end of treatment. For both the in-person and telehealth methods of delivering partial hospital level of care, patients were highly satisfied with the initial diagnostic evaluation and were optimistic at admission that treatment would be helpful. At the completion of treatment, both groups were highly satisfied with all components of the treatment program and almost all would recommend treatment to a friend or family member. Thus, patient satisfaction was as high with telehealth partial hospital treatment as with in-person treatment.",10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113966,wos,Psychiatry,Patient satisfaction; COVID-19; Telehealth; Partial hospital,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113966)

The aim of this scoping review is to map (i) the main categories of patient-focused Internet interventions within fertility care, (ii) the detailed composition of the interventions and (iii) how these interventions were evaluated. A literature search used various oInternet' and oInfertility' search terms to identify relevant studies published up to 1 September 2011. The selected studies had to include patients facing infertility and using an infertility-related Internet intervention. We charted data regarding categories of interventions, components of interventions and evaluation methodology. We categorized the stages of research using the UKs Medical Research Council framework for evaluating complex interventions. We included 20 studies and identified 3 educational interventions, 2 self-help interventions, 1 human-supported therapeutic intervention, 9 online support groups and 2 counselling services. Information provision, support and mental health promotion were common aims. Few interactive online components were present in the online programmes. Three studies were in the pilot phase and 17 were in the evaluation phase. Several categories of patient-focused Internet-based interventions in fertility care are primarily applied to provide support and education and promote mental health. The interventions could be improved by using more interactive and dynamic elements as their key components. Finally, more emphasis on methodological standards for complex interventions is needed to produce more rigorous evaluations.

Patients' experiences with virtual group gut-directed hypnotherapy: A qualitative study,Good,"Gerson, J; Tawde, P; Ghiasian, G; Salwen-Deremer, JK",FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE,2023,"BackgroundHypnotherapy is a useful treatment for a variety of gastrointestinal conditions. While there is strong evidence for delivering other treatments virtually and in groups, there is no research thus far on delivering hypnotherapy in this format. Given the growth of both psychogastroenterology and telehealth, these methods should be explored as they have great potential for increasing access and cost-effectiveness of intervention. AimsThis qualitative study was developed to help understand patients experiences in virtual, group-based, gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) in two different institutions. MethodsAuthors developed a qualitative interview with the assistance of two patient partners and then recruited patients from New York University and Dartmouth Health to participate. Interviews were completed one-on-one with patients who started and then completed GDH (>= 5 visits) and who did not complete GDH (<= 3 visits). Data were coded and then analyzed using thematic analysis. ResultsTwenty-one patients from NYU and Dartmouth participated in qualitative interviews. Broadly, patients reported coming to GDH because they believed in the importance of the mind-body connection or were desperate for treatment. Regardless of why patients came to GDH, they generally reported positive outcomes for GI symptoms and for other physical and mental health conditions. Most patients appreciated the group and virtual formats, though some concerns about inflexible schedules and lack of anonymity were voiced. Despite these concerns, there was broad support for virtual, group-based GDH and general excitement for behavioral health programming. ConclusionVirtual, group-based GDH is an acceptable treatment for patients from rural and urban settings. Given the possible improvements in access and cost-effectiveness that this treatment modality can provide, GI practices may want to consider it in lieu of or in addition to the traditional one-on-one treatment format.

Peer-to-peer support: digital networking in aphasia to improve quality of life (PeerPAL),Not mental health,"Kurfess, C; Corsten, S; Nickel, MT; Knieriemen, M; Kreiter, D; Lauer, N",FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION,2023,"BackgroundPeople with aphasia (PWA) often suffer from reduced participation and quality of life. Nevertheless, there are currently only a few specific interventions that respond to this problem. Participation and quality of life could be increased by interacting with peers who have similar experiences. Digital social networks could stimulate an autonomous interaction. However, digital social networks need to be adapted to the specific needs of PWA. Therefore, a participatory, agile process involving the target group should be chosen to develop such a solution, i.e., an app. The research project consists of a total of three phases. In the first phase-app development-the app was developed and programmed including the target group. In the second phase-app testing-the usability and user-friendliness of the app were evaluated with four PWA. In the third phase-feasibility and preliminary efficacy-that will be described in the article, the impact of the app on PWA will be evaluated.AimsThe overarching aim of our study is to provide preliminary efficacy of the intervention. Digital social interaction with other PWA can lead to increased social integration. In addition to digital interaction, personal encounters between PWA should be encouraged. As a result, we expect an improvement in quality of life of PWA. Additionally, we focus on identification of the most appropriate measurements to discover changes associated with the intervention.MethodsThe evaluation, which is described in this paper, takes place in a pre-test - post-test design with a total of n = 48 PWA. Participants will be recruited in regional clusters to facilitate face-to-face meetings. Half of the participants will be assigned to the delayed intervention group and the other half to the immediate intervention group. Participants in the delayed intervention group will go through a 3-month waiting period before using the app, while the participants of the immediate intervention group will start using the app for 3 months right away. Inclusion criteria are the presence of chronic aphasia (at least 6 months) and possession of a smartphone with internet access. Questionnaires on quality of life (SAQOL-39, GHQ-12), depression (GDS, DISCs), communicative participation (CPIB), and social support (F-SozU) will be conducted at inclusion (t0), after 3 months of app use (t1), and after another 3 months for follow-up (t2). Participants in the delayed intervention group will be assessed twice before the intervention, before the 3-month waiting period (t0a) and after the waiting period (t0b). In addition to the quantitative measures, interviews will take place with 6 to 8 selected participants after 3 months of app use. Responses will be analysed using Thematic Analysis.DiscussionThe app will be the first social network tool that is systematically developed with PWA. Initial indications from the first phases are that the app can be used by PWA, so that the evaluation of this app version can take place in the third phase. Results of this study can provide an initial indication of whether social network support is a suitable intervention. Findings will help provide information on the feasibility of digital connectivity for PWA. Preliminary findings on its impact on the participation and quality of life of PWA could be made available.",10.3389/fcomm.2023.1187233,wos,Communication,aphasia; digital participation; quality of life; social network; peer-to-peer support,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2023.1187233)
Perceptions and Experiences of Frontline Urban Indian Organization Healthcare Workers With Infection Prevention and Control During the COVID-19 Pandemic,Not mental health,"Collins, N; Crowder, J; Ishcomer-Aazami, J; Apedjihoun, D",FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created significant challenges for outpatient healthcare providers and patients across the United States (U.S.). Forty-one Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs), who provide a wide spectrum of health services for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations and other underinsured and uninsured populations in urban areas across the country, are no exception. The National Council of Urban Indian Health (NCUIH), in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), set out to understand the needs, challenges, and opportunities for improvement in infection prevention and control (IPC) training and systems from the perspective of UIO frontline healthcare workers. As part of the CDC's Project Firstline, NCUIH was chosen as a partner in a national collaborative. The first task was to conduct listening sessions with frontline UIO staff to learn more about IPC practices in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty staff from 16 UIOs, representing full ambulatory, limited ambulatory, outreach and referral, and outpatient and residential treatment programs participated in virtual video focus groups in July of 2020. Thematic and content analysis protocols guided data analysis and coding. Analysis of findings generated four major themes: staff adaptation in the context of resilience; responsibility and duty to protect patients, families, and coworkers; mental and emotional issues for UIO staff; and IPC challenges in the context of COVID-19. Participants' challenges ranged from lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE) to the absence of standardized training. Significant disparities in social determinants of health experienced by Native American and non-Native populations served by UIOs create additional challenges to the delivery of and access to care during the pandemic. The diverse array of tribal cultural values and contexts of the people and communities served by UIOs reportedly serve as both facilitators and barriers to care, awareness, and uptake of infectious disease public health practices.",10.3389/fsoc.2021.611961,"pubmed, wos",Sociology,public health; mental health; epidemic; COVID-19; healthcare worker; urban Indian health organization; American Indian and Alaska Native; minority health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.611961)
Performance of a propensity score adjustment in longitudinal studies with covariate-dependent representation,Other,"Leon, AC; Hedeker, D; Li, CS; Demirtas, H",STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,2012,"Longitudinal observational studies provide rich opportunities to examine treatment effectiveness during the course of a chronic illness. However, there are threats to the validity of observational inferences. For instance, clinician judgment and self-selection play key roles in treatment assignment. To account for this, an adjustment such as the propensity score can be used if certain assumptions are fulfilled. Here, we consider a problem that could surface in a longitudinal observational study and has been largely overlooked. It can occur when subjects have a varying number of distinct periods of therapeutic intervention. We evaluate the implications of baseline variables in the propensity model being associated with the number of post baseline observations per subject and refer to it as 'covariate-dependent representation'. An observational study of antidepressant treatment effectiveness serves as a motivating example. The analyses examine the first 20 years of follow-up data from the National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Depression Study, a longitudinal, observational study. A simulation study evaluates the consequences of covariate-dependent representation in longitudinal observational studies of treatment effectiveness under a range of data specifications. The simulations found that estimates were adversely affected by under representation when there was lower ICC among repeated doses and among repeated outcomes.

Perinatal support for couples during COVID-19: A descriptive qualitative study,Good,"Shorey, S; Tan, TC; Thilagamangai; Mathews, J; Lim, SH; Shi, LM; Chua, JS; Chan, YH; Law, E; Chee, C; Chong, YS",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING,2023,"Aims and objectives To explore the perspectives of parents during the perinatal period amid the COVID-19 pandemic and explore the experiences of Singaporean parents receiving perinatal support via the Supportive Parenting App (SPA). Background The stressors accompanying parenting responsibilities often affect the overall well-being of the family unit. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, Singaporean parents are forced to shoulder childcare responsibilities with minimal support due to safety restrictions. The Supportive Parenting Application (SPA) was introduced to parents during the start of the pandemic to offer timely additional support. It is a mobile health application-based educational support for parents across the perinatal period, consisting of features such as peer support, expert advice and discussion forums. Design Descriptive qualitative study. Methods Semi-structured one-to-one interviews were conducted with 33 parents (16 from the control group, 17 from the intervention group) in an ongoing randomised controlled trial between June 2021 and February 2022. The COREQ checklist was used to guide the reporting of the data. Results Four themes with 10 subthemes describing the perinatal experiences of parents were identified. The themes include 'Ups and downs' of parenting experiences; Perinatal care from 'best care' to 'flying blind'; What kept couples going and Use of technology-a way forward. Conclusion Although COVID-19 negatively affected parents' availability of care and support, most could still access other support sources to help them. Additionally, the SPA was found to be a dependable information source for the intervention group parents. Future research could work on improving technology-based support based on the feedback given to offer better quality perinatal care for parents. Relevance to clinical practice Technology-based support provided by healthcare professionals helps provide reliable perinatal information and support for parents. More efforts should be directed towards developing quality informational resources and support to improve perinatal care.

Peripheral intravenous infusion for children based on computer digital video technology,Not Multi User,"Tang, YH; Zhu, LH; Hui, XJ; Chen, YY",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH,2023,"Purpose: Intravenous infusion techniques often take a long time and require continuous monitoring of the infusion, and the needle must be removed promptly at the end of the injection, placing a burden on the patient, family and medical workers. Thus, this paper presents a droplet flow rate monitoring system based on an embedded system. Methods: In our retrospective study, according to different intervention measures, 80 patients were divided into two groups to compare the improvement of children's adverse psychological conditions. The patients were divided into control and intervention groups, with 40 patients in each group. Patients in the intervention group received psychological care and Online Real-Time Fusion Method to monitor the infusion state. Patients in the control group received routine infusions. Computer digital video technology and online real-time fusion algorithm were utilized to determine whether the parameters of the intravenous infusion model were optimized. The model's accuracy was used to evaluate whether the success rate of one-time needle insertion was improved. Results: The system can also be used for other monitoring. It is simple and convenient to set up and dismantle. The system can significantly relieve medical workers and patients. It was found that the observation group is significantly better than the control group in terms of psychological improvement (P < 0.05). Comparing the patient's satisfaction, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant. Conclusion: When administering intravenous infusions in children, applying various forms of psychological interventions and giving emotional support can significantly improve their compliance and their mental state. It is of great significance to enhance the effect of infusions in patients.",NA,wos,Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,Computer digital video; children?s intravenous infusion; popular science video; real-time fusion,URI::(https://www.doi.org/NA)

Sickness absence resulting from CMDs is often long-lasting and advancing return to work is a complex process impacted by several factors, among which self-efficacy appears to be an important personal resource. Person-centred care (PCC) has previously shown positive effects on self-efficacy however this needs to be further investigated in relation to patients with CMDs and in an eHealth context. Methods and analysis This study is an open randomised controlled trial comparing a control group receiving standard care with an intervention group receiving standard care plus PCC by telephone and a digital platform. The primary outcome measure is a composite score of changes in sick leave and self-efficacy. Participants will include 220 primary care patients on sick leave due to CMDs and data will mainly be collected through questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months from the inclusion date. Inclusion is ongoing and expected to be completed during the fall of 2020. A process and health economic evaluation will also be conducted.

Personalised digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption in community-dwelling populations,Not Multi User,"Kaner, EFS; Beyer, FR; Garnett, C; Crane, D; Brown, J; Muirhead, C; Redmore, J; O'Donnell, A; Newham, JJ; de Vocht, F; Hickman, M; Brown, H; Maniatopoulos, G; Michie, S",COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,2017,"Background Excessive alcohol use contributes significantly to physical and psychological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social harm in all age groups. A proven strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption levels is to offer a brief conversation-based intervention in primary care settings, but more recent technological innovations have enabled people to interact directly via computer, mobile device or smartphone with digital interventions designed to address problem alcohol consumption. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, or both, in people living in the community, specifically: (i) Are digital interventions more effective and cost-effective than no intervention (or minimal input) controls? (ii) Are digital interventions at least equally effective as face-to-face brief alcohol interventions? (iii) What are the effective component behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their mechanisms of action? (iv) What theories or models have been used in the development and/or evaluation of the intervention? Secondary objectives were (i) to assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the digital intervention targets participants attending health, social care, education or other community-based settings and those where it is offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone platforms; (ii) to specify interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of delivery on outcomes. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HTA and Web of Knowledge databases; ClinicalTrials.com and WHO ICTRP trials registers and relevant websites to April 2017. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no intervention or with face-to-face interventions for reducing hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people living in the community and reported a measure of alcohol consumption. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence). Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention control participants (moderate-quality evidence). Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions. A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). 'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention. The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, 95% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B -48.03, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27), information about antecedents (B -74.20, 95% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80) and credible source (B -39.89, 95% CI -72.66 to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models. In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B -95.12, 95% CI -162.90 to -27.34), problem solving (B -45.92, 95% CI -90.97 to -0.87), and credible source (B -32.09, 95% CI -60.64 to -3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption. The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheoretical Model (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20). Over half of the interventions (n = 21, 51%) made no mention of theory. Only two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention. There was no evidence of an association between reporting theory use and intervention effectiveness. Authors' conclusions There is moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the reduction was lower. Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face interventions. The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context. Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present. Over half of the interventions made no reference to any theories. Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness.",10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2,"pubmed, wos",General & Internal Medicine,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2)
Personalized digital intervention for depression based on social rhythm principles adds significantly to outpatient treatment,Not Multi User,"Frank, E; Wallace, ML; Matthews, ML; Kendrick, J; Leach, J; Moore, T; Aranovich, G; Choudhury, T; Shah, NR; Framroze, Z; Posey, G; Burgess, S; Kupfer, DJ",FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH,2022,"We conducted a 16-week randomized controlled trial in psychiatric outpatients with a lifetime diagnosis of a mood and/or anxiety disorder to measure the impact of a first-of-its-kind precision digital intervention software solution based on social rhythm regulation principles. The full intent-to-treat (ITT) sample consisted of 133 individuals, aged 18-65. An exploratory sub-sample of interest was those individuals who presented with moderately severe to severe depression at study entry (baseline PHQ-8 score =15; N = 28). Cue is a novel digital intervention platform that capitalizes on the smartphone's ability to continuously monitor depression-relevant behavior patterns and use each patient's behavioral data to provide timely, personalized micro-interventions, making this the first example of a precision digital intervention of which we are aware. Participants were randomly allocated to receive Cue plus care-as-usual or digital monitoring only plus care as usual. Within the full study and depressed-at-entry samples, we fit a mixed effects model to test for group differences in the slope of depressive symptoms over 16 weeks. To account for the non-linear trajectory with more flexibility, we also fit a mixed effects model considering week as a categorical variable and used the resulting estimates to test the group difference in PHQ change from baseline to 16 weeks. In the full sample, the group difference in the slope of PHQ-8 was negligible (Cohen's d = -0.10); however, the Cue group demonstrated significantly greater improvement from baseline to 16 weeks (p = 0.040). In the depressed-at-entry sample, we found evidence for benefit of Cue. The group difference in the slope of PHQ-8 (Cohen's d = -0.72) indicated a meaningfully more rapid rate of improvement in the intervention group than in the control group. The Cue group also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in PHQ-8 from baseline to 16 weeks (p = 0.009). We are encouraged by the size of the intervention effect in those who were acutely ill at baseline, and by the finding that across all participants, 80% of whom were receiving pharmacotherapy, we observed significant benefit of Cue at 16 weeks of treatment. These findings suggest that a social rhythm-focused digital intervention platform may represent a useful and accessible adjunct to antidepressant treatment.",10.3389/fdgth.2022.870522,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,depression; treatment; digital intervention platform; passive monitoring; depressive symtpoms; social rhythm disruption; social rhythm regularity,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2022.870522)
Personalized eHealth Program for Life-style Change: Results From the Do Cardiac Health Advanced New Generated Ecosystem (Do CHANGE 2) Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Broers, ER; Widdershoven, J; Denollet, J; Lodder, P; Kop, WJ; Wetzels, M; Ayoola, I; Piera-Jimenez, J; Habibovic, M",PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE,2020,"Objective Unhealthy life-style factors have adverse outcomes in cardiac patients. However, only a minority of patients succeed to change unhealthy habits. Personalization of interventions may result in critical improvements. The current randomized controlled trial provides a proof of concept of the personalized Do Cardiac Health Advanced New Generation Ecosystem (Do CHANGE) 2 intervention and evaluates effects on a) life-style and b) quality of life over time. Methods Cardiac patients (n = 150; mean age = 61.97 +/- 11.61 years; 28.7% women; heart failure, n = 33; coronary artery disease, n = 50; hypertension, n = 67) recruited from Spain and the Netherlands were randomized to either the Do CHANGE 2 or care as usual group. The Do CHANGE 2 group received ambulatory health-behavior assessment technologies for 6 months combined with a 3-month behavioral intervention program. Linear mixed-model analysis was used to evaluate the intervention effects, and latent class analysis was used for secondary subgroup analysis. Results Linear mixed-model analysis showed significant intervention effects for life-style behavior (F-interaction(2,138.5) = 5.97, p = .003), with improvement of life-style behavior in the intervention group. For quality of life, no significant main effect (F(1,138.18) = .58, p = .447) or interaction effect (F(2,133.1) = 0.41, p = .67) was found. Secondary latent class analysis revealed different subgroups of patients per outcome measure. The intervention was experienced as useful and feasible. Conclusions The personalized eHealth intervention resulted in significant improvements in life-style. Cardiac patients and health care providers were also willing to engage in this personalized digital behavioral intervention program.

Personalized implementation of video telehealth for rural veterans (PIVOT-R),Not Multi User,"Day, SC; Day, G; Keller, M; Touchett, H; Amspoker, AB; Martin, L; Lindsay, JA",MHEALTH,2021,"Background: A national shortage of mental health (MH) professionals leaves more than 90% of rural individuals without adequate access to services each year, troubling because 33% of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) enrollees live in rural areas and rural Veterans have a greater risk of suicide than urban Veterans. Additional barriers such as travel distance and cost, stigma and extreme weather or geography add to challenges of rural Veterans seeking treatment. Although the VHA has addressed this disparity by providing telemental health services, provision of services via traditional hub-and-spoke and/or establishment of regional centers has not fully addressed barriers or resource limitations. Video telehealth to home (VTH) has assisted in better addressing geographic, attitudinal and systematic barriers to in-person care; however, its uptake and implementation have been problematic. This article describes the Personalized Implementation of Video Telehealth for Rural Veterans (PIVOT-R) approach, developed in response to the unique needs of rural veterans. Methods: We developed PIVOT, a flexible implementation strategy that is adaptive to site-specific contexts and different digital innovations and relies on a collaborative relationship between external facilitators, internal facilitators and clinical champions. We used formative evaluation (FE) to gather ongoing information about our quality improvement (QI) implementation approach of VTH. Our FE of PIVOT at rural sites provided insight into adaptations to improve rural implementation. This led to development of PIVOT-R, which explicitly focuses on rural implementation. PIVOT-R, developed from provider and patient feedback plus lessons learned during implementation, focuses on rurality as an important diversity factor and addresses relationship building, engaging the site, assessing context and infrastructure and balancing national expectations with site-level goals. During fiscal year 2018 we partnered with a VHA healthcare system in a Western mountain state to pilot the PIVOT-R approach, again using FE which included quantitative and qualitative data collection to evaluate its impact. Results: PIVOT-R effectively increased uptake of VTH for MH care at the healthcare system evaluated. In fiscal year 2019 the percentage of Veterans receiving MH care via VTH at the site was 10 times greater than in fiscal year 2018, matching the mean VHA nationwide percentage and increasing by 43.24% by the end of 2019. Veteran feedback supported a positive experience by users. Conclusions: Inclusion of a comprehensive assessment of the rural system, including infrastructure and resources, greatly improves understanding of a system's specific needs and enables a tailored approach targeting relevant barriers. Our FE suggests the potential of PIVOT-R to increase VTH uptake at other rural locations and reinforces the value of telehealth technology as an important resource for rural sites.",10.21037/mhealth.2020.03.02,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,Veterans; centers; rural health; mental health services; telemedicine; implementation; health plan,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.21037/mhealth.2020.03.02)
Phonics training for English-speaking poor readers,Not mental health,"McArthur, G; Eve, PM; Jones, K; Banales, E; Kohnen, S; Anandakumar, T; Larsen, L; Marinus, E; Wang, HC; Castles, A",COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,2012,"Background Around 5% of English speakers have a significant problem with learning to read words. Poor word readers are often trained to use letter-sound rules to improve their reading skills. This training is commonly called phonics. Well over 100 studies have administered some form of phonics training to poor word readers. However, there are surprisingly few systematic reviews or meta-analyses of these studies. The most well-known review was done by the National Reading Panel (Ehri 2001) 12 years ago and needs updating. The most recent review (Suggate 2010) focused solely on children and did not include unpublished studies. Objectives The primary aim of this review was to measure the effect that phonics training has on the literacy skills of English-speaking children, adolescents, and adults whose reading was at least one standard deviation (SD), one year, or one grade below the expected level, despite no reported problems that could explain their impaired ability to learn to read. A secondary objective was to explore the impact of various factors, such as length of training or training group size, that might moderate the effect of phonics training on poor word reading skills. Search methods We searched the following databases in July 2012: CENTRAL 2012 (Issue 6), MEDLINE 1948 to June week 3 2012, EMBASE 1980 to 2012 week 26, DARE 2013 (Issue 6), ERIC (1966 to current), PsycINFO (1806 to current), CINAHL (1938 to current), Science Citation Index (1970 to 29 June 2012), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 29 June 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (1990 to 29 June 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (1990 to 29 June 2012), ZETOC, Index to Theses-UK and Ireland, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, DART Europe E-theses Portal, Australasian Digital Theses Program, Education Research Theses, Electronic Theses Online System, Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. Theses Canada portal, www.dissertation.com, and www.thesisabstracts.com. We also contacted experts and examined the reference lists of published studies. Selection criteria We included studies that use randomisation, quasi-randomisation, or minimisation to allocate participants to either a phonics intervention group (phonics alone, phonics and phoneme awareness training, or phonics and irregular word reading training) or a control group (no training or alternative training, such as maths). Participants were English-speaking children, adolescents, or adults whose word reading was below the level expected for their age for no known reason (that is, they had adequate attention and no known physical, neurological, or psychological problems). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Main results We found 11 studies that met the criteria for this review. They involved 736 participants. We measured the effect of phonics training on eight outcomes. The amount of evidence for each outcome varied considerably, ranging from 10 studies for word reading accuracy to one study for nonword reading fluency. The effect sizes for the outcomes were: word reading accuracy standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.88; 10 studies), nonword reading accuracy SMD 0.76 (95% CI 0.25 to 1.27; eight studies), word reading fluency SMD -0.51 (95% CI -1.14 to 0.13; two studies), reading comprehension SMD 0.14 (95% CI -0.46 to 0.74; three studies), spelling SMD 0.36 (95% CI -0.27 to 1.00; two studies), letter-sound knowledge SMD 0.35 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.65; three studies), and phonological output SMD 0.38 (95% -0.04 to 0.80; four studies). There was one result in a negative direction for nonword reading fluency SMD 0.38 (95% CI -0.55 to 1.32; one study), though this was not statistically significant. We did five subgroup analyses on two outcomes that had sufficient data (word reading accuracy and nonword reading accuracy). The efficacy of phonics training was not moderated significantly by training type (phonics alone versus phonics and phoneme awareness versus phonics and irregular word training), training intensity (less than two hours per week versus at least two hours per week), training duration (less than three months versus at least three months), training group size (one-on-one versus small group training), or training administrator (human administration versus computer administration). Authors' conclusions Phonics training appears to be effective for improving some reading skills. Specifically, statistically significant effects were found for nonword reading accuracy (large effect), word reading accuracy (moderate effect), and letter-sound knowledge (small-to-moderate effect). For several other outcomes, there were small or moderate effect sizes that did not reach statistical significance but may be meaningful: word reading fluency, spelling, phonological output, and reading comprehension. The effect for nonword reading fluency, which was measured in only one study, was in a negative direction, but this was not statistically significant.

Physiotherapy breathing retraining for asthma: a randomised controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Bruton, A; Lee, A; Yardley, L; Raftery, J; Arden-Close, E; Kirby, S; Zhu, SH; Thiruvothiyur, M; Webley, F; Taylor, L; Gibson, D; Yao, GQ; Stafford-Watson, M; Versnel, J; Moore, M; George, S; Little, P; Djukanovic, R; Price, D; Pavord, ID; Holgate, ST; Thomas, M",LANCET RESPIRATORY MEDICINE,2018,"Background Despite effective pharmacotherapy, asthma continues to impair quality of life for most patients. Non-pharmacological approaches, including breathing retraining, are therefore of great interest to patients. However, clinicians rarely advocate breathing retraining and access to this intervention is restricted for most patients due to the limited availability of suitable physiotherapists and poor integration of breathing retraining into standard care. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a digital self-guided breathing retraining intervention. Methods In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients from 34 general practices in the UK. Eligibility criteria for patients with asthma were broad, comprising a physician diagnosis of asthma, age of 16-70 years, receipt of at least one anti-asthma medication in the previous year, and impaired asthma-related quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ] score of <5.5). We developed a self-guided intervention, which was delivered as a DVD plus a printed booklet (DVDB). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the DVDB intervention, three face-to-face breathing retraining sessions, or standard care, in a 2: 1: 2 ratio, for 12 months. Randomisation was achieved using the Southampton Clinical Trials Unit telephone randomisation service by use of random number generators. The primary outcome was the AQLQ score in the intention-to-treat population at 12 months. The trial was powered to show equivalence between the two active intervention groups, and superiority of both intervention groups over usual care. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported and physiological measures of asthma control, patient acceptability, and health-care costs. This trial was registered with International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry, number ISRCTN88318003. Findings Between Nov 5, 2012 and Jan 28, 2014, invitations to participate in the study were sent to 15 203 patients with general practitioner-diagnosed asthma, of whom 655 were recruited into the study. AQLQ scores at 12 months were significantly higher in the DVDB group (mean 5.40, SD 1.14) than in the usual care group (5.12, SD 1.17; adjusted mean difference 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.44), and in the face-to-face group (5.33, SD 1.06) than in the usual care group (adjusted mean difference 0.24, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.44); AQLQ scores were similar between the DVDB group and the face-to-face group (0.04, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.24). There were no significant differences between the randomisation groups in FEV1 or fraction of exhaled nitric oxide. 744 adverse events occurred in 272 patients: 101 (39%) of 261 patients in the DVDB group, 55 (42%) of 132 patients in the face-to-face group, and 132 (50%) of 262 in the usual care group, with patients reporting one or more event. 11 (4%) patients in the DVDB group, four (3%) patients in the face-to-face group, and 20 (8%) patients in the usual care group had a serious adverse event. Interpretation Breathing retraining programmes improve quality of life in patients with incompletely controlled asthma despite having little effect on lung function or airway inflammation. Such programmes can be delivered conveniently and cost-effectively as a self-guided digital audiovisual programme, so might also reduce health-care costs.",10.1016/S2213-2600(17)30474-5,wos,General & Internal Medicine; Respiratory System,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(17)30474-5)

Piloting a prenatal care smartphone application and care navigation intervention at a federally qualified health center,Not Multi User,"Vani, K; Katehis, I; Bernstein, PS; Lebron-Reyes, C; Chung, HY; Bruney, T; Karkowsky, CE",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY MFM,2023,"BACKGROUND: Given that smartphones are widely used among reproductive-age people of all socioeconomic backgrounds, a smartphone application may be a useful supplement to routine prenatal care.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the implementation of a smartphone app that offers patient education, depression screening, social determinants of health screening, and care coordination as an adjunct to routine prenatal care at a federally qualified health center. We further sought to characterize app engagement and the association of app use with pregnancy outcomes.STUDY DESIGN: The implementation of the smartphone app was a quality improvement initiative in which the app was made available to all peo-ple receiving prenatal care at a designated federally qualified health center between December 2020 and December 2021. Individuals who both initiated prenatal care at this site before 28 weeks of gestation and delivered at our institution during the above-defined period were studied retrospectively after obtaining institutional approval. Summary statistics were used to describe app implementation and information regarding social determinants of health and depression screening. Demographics and maternal and neonatal out-comes were compared between app enrollees and patients receiving prenatal care at the same site who were not enrolled in the app. Data were analyzed using the 2-sample t test to compare continuous variables and the chi-square test to compare categorical variables.RESULTS: Overall, 800 patients receiving prenatal care at the federally qualified health center during the identified period were telephonically approached for enrollment in the smartphone app. A total of 613 people (76.6%) were successfully reached, and of those successfully reached, 538 (87.7%) accepted enrollment in the app; 76.6% of app enrollees (n=412) completed at least 1 social determinants of health screen. Of those, 29.1% (n=120) screened positive for at least 1 need. Of those with positive screens, 51.7% (n=62) accepted referral to resources to address the identified need. Furthermore, 81% of app enrollees (n=443) com-pleted at least 1 depression screen. Of those, 13.1% (n=58) screened positive for depression, and 37.9% (n=22) of those with positive screens accepted a referral to behavioral health services. A total of 483 people met the inclusion criteria for retrospective review: 264 were enrolled in the smartphone app and 219 were not. App enrollees were more likely to speak English (79.9% of app group vs 61.6% of the non-app group; P<.0001), identify as Hispanic (52.7% vs 39.7%; P=.02), and be pri-vately insured (24.6% vs 15.5%; P=.005), and less likely to have a social determinants of health-related need (10.0% vs 21.0%; P=.01). There were no significant differences in mode of delivery or maternal and neona-tal outcomes between the 2 groups.CONCLUSION: A high proportion of patients receiving care through our federally qualified health center enrolled in and used the smartphone app and its associated care coordination. This could be a useful tool to screen for depression and adverse social determinants of health in under-served communities. Given that individuals of higher-resource back-grounds seem more likely to enroll in smartphone apps, a more targeted approach is needed to help connect patients of lower-resource back-grounds to smartphone apps and the resources that they offer.",10.1016/j.ajogmf.2023.101135,wos,Obstetrics & Gynecology,implementation science; innovations in prenatal care; innovative care models; quality improvement; smartphone applications; telemedicine,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2023.101135)

Planning and developing a web-based intervention for active surveillance in prostate cancer: an integrated self-care programme for managing psychological distress,Not mental health,"Hughes, S; Kassianos, AP; Everitt, HA; Stuart, B; Band, R",PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES,2022,"Objectives: To outline the planning, development and optimisation of a psycho-educational behavioural intervention for patients on active surveillance for prostate cancer. The intervention aimed to support men manage active surveillance-related psychological distress. Methods: The person-based approach (PBA) was used as the overarching guiding methodological framework for intervention development. Evidence-based methods were incorporated to improve robustness. The process commenced with data gathering activities comprising the following four components: A systematic review and meta-analysis of depression and anxiety in prostate cancer A cross-sectional survey on depression and anxiety in active surveillance A review of existing interventions in the field A qualitative study with the target audience The purpose of this paper is to bring these components together and describe how they facilitated the establishment of key guiding principles and a logic model, which underpinned the first draft of the intervention. Results: The prototype intervention, named PROACTIVE, consists of six Internet-based sessions run concurrently with three group support sessions. The sessions cover the following topics: lifestyle (diet and exercise), relaxation and resilience techniques, talking to friends and family, thoughts and feelings, daily life (money and work) and information about prostate cancer and active surveillance. The resulting intervention has been trialled in a feasibility study, the results of which are published elsewhere. Conclusions: The planning and development process is key to successful delivery of an appropriate, accessible and acceptable intervention. The PBA strengthened the intervention by drawing on target-user experiences to maximise acceptability and user engagement.

Play and heal: Randomized controlled trial of Ditto™ intervention efficacy on improving re-epithelialization in pediatric burns,Not Multi User,"Brown, NJ; Kimble, RM; Rodger, S; Ware, RS; Cuttle, L",BURNS,2014,"Background: The relationships between pain, stress and anxiety, and their effect on burn wound re-epithelialization have not been well explored to-date. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the Ditto (TM) (a hand-held electronic medical device providing procedural preparation and distraction) intervention on re-epithelialization rates in acute pediatric burns. Methods/Design: From August 2011 to August 2012, children (4-12 years) with an acute burn presenting to the Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia fulfilled the study requirements and were randomized to [1] Ditto (TM) intervention or [2] standard practice. Burn re-epithelialization, pain intensity, anxiety and stress measures were obtained at every dressing change until complete wound re-epithelialization. Results: One hundred and seventeen children were randomized and 75 children were analyzed (n = 40 standard group; n = 35 Ditto (TM) group). Inability to predict wound management resulted in 42 participants no longer meeting the eligibility criteria. Wounds in the Ditto (TM) intervention group re-epithelialized faster than the standard practice group (-2.14 days (CI: -4.38 to 0.10), p-value = 0.061), and significantly faster when analyses were adjusted for mean burn depth (-2.26 days (CI: -4.48 to -0.04), p-value = 0.046). Following procedural preparation at the first change of dressing, the Ditto (TM) group reported lower pain intensity scores (-0.64 (CI: -1.28, 0.01) p = 0.052) and lower anxiety ratings (-1.79 (CI: -3.59, 0.01) p = 0.051). At the second and third dressing removals average pain (FPS-R and FLACC) and anxiety scores (VAS-A) were at least one point lower when Ditto (TM) intervention was received. Conclusions: The Ditto (TM) procedural preparation and distraction device is a useful tool alongside pharmacological intervention to improve the rate of burn re-epithelialization and manage pain and anxiety during burn wound care procedures.

Popular Mental Health Apps (MH Apps) as a Complement to Telepsychotherapy: Guidelines for Consideration,Good,"Wang, LY; Fagan, C; Yu, CL",JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTHERAPY INTEGRATION,2020,"With the increasing need to minimize in-person contact as a way to stem the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the world, many clinicians are now providing mental health care exclusively through telepsychotherapy. Mental health mobile applications (MH apps) offer clients complementary therapeutic resources available outside of the telepsychotherapy session and have the potential to enhance the quality of care. However, not all mental health apps are created equal and clinicians lack guidance on how best to evaluate MH apps. This article discusses several ethical and practical considerations involved in using MH apps as an adjunct to telepsychotherapy, proposes recommendations for app evaluation, and provides a summary table of 28 popular English-language MH apps to assist clinicians in evaluating the manyMHapps available on the market today. The authors conducted a review of recent literature in EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) and included 10 peer reviewed, English language meta-analyses and systematic reviews on the efficacy of MH apps. The emerging literature suggests that the MH apps that have been studied in randomized control trials provide some benefit for targeted problems (e.g., depression) over waitlist control groups and under some circumstances are comparable to active intervention groups, although effect sizes tend to be small. However, of the 28 popular MH apps featured in this article, only 5 were found to have empirical support.

A digital musculoskeletal surgical care program was developed to support the population of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Objective: We aimed to demonstrate safety, engagement, and acceptability and explore clinical outcomes, health care use, and satisfaction among participants of a digital musculoskeletal surgical care program who were undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Methods: A retrospective, observational feasibility study comparing digital musculoskeletal surgical care program participants to a comparison group was conducted. The intervention group registered for a digital musculoskeletal surgical care program, which included health coaches, physical therapists, and tailored exercises and educational articles to provide preoperative and postoperative support to patients who had recently undergone total knee arthroplasty. Comparison group members received standard-of-care treatment. Engagement (number of exercise therapy sessions and educational articles accessed per week) and acceptability (Net Promoter Score) were examined among intervention group participants. Descriptive statistics for postoperative outcomes, including safety (postoperative complications), clinical improvement (pain, function, anxiety, and depression), and health care use and experiences (length of hospital stay, surgery satisfaction, and physical therapy adherence), were reported for both groups. Differences among postoperative results were compared by using the independent samples 2-tailed t test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous outcomes and the Fisher exact test or chi-square test for categorical outcomes. Results: Of the 53 participants (intervention group: n=22; comparison group: n=31) who were included in this study, 35 (66%) were female and 25 (47%) were aged from 45 to 60 years. On average, the intervention group completed 23 exercise sessions, read 2.7 educational articles, sent 45.5 texts to their health coaches, and were actively engaged for 6 weeks after their operation. Among 21 participants, 14 (67%) self-reported as promoters on the Net Promoter Score scale. Intervention group members reported fewer postoperative complications (6/22, 27%) than the comparison group (15/31, 48%), and they experienced better outcomes with regard to function (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form-intervention group: mean 23.0; comparison group: mean 32.5), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 2-Item-intervention group: mean 0.4; comparison group: mean 1.6), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 2-Item-intervention group: mean 0.6; comparison group: mean 1.5), and impressions of change (Patient Global Impression of Change-intervention group: median 7.0; comparison group: median 6.0).

Potential Benefits of Incorporating Peer-to-Peer Interactions Into Digital Interventions for Psychotic Disorders: A Systematic Review,Good,"Biagianti, B; Quraishi, SH; Schlosser, DA",PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES,2018,"Objective: Peer-to-peer interactions and support groups mitigate experiences of social isolation and loneliness often reported by individuals with psychotic disorders. Online peer-to-peer communication can promote broader use of this form of social support. Peer-to-peer interactions occur naturally on social media platforms, but they can negatively affect mental health. Recent digital interventions for persons with psychotic disorders have harnessed the principles of social media to incorporate peer-to-peer communication. This review examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of recent digital interventions in order to identify strategies to maximize benefits of online peer-to-peer communication for persons with psychotic disorders. Methods: An electronic database search of PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Health Technology Assessment Database was conducted in February 2017 and yielded a total of 1,015 results. Eight publications that reported data from six independent trials and five interventions were reviewed. Results: The technology supporting peer-to-peer communication varied greatly across studies, from online forums to embedded social networking. When peer-to-peer interactions were moderated by facilitators, retention, engagement, acceptability, and efficacy were higher than for interventions with no facilitators. Individuals with psychotic disorders were actively engaged with moderated peer-to-peer communication and showed improvements in perceived social support. Studies involving service users in intervention design showed higher rates of acceptability. Conclusions: Individuals with psychotic disorders value and benefit from digital interventions that include moderated peer-to-peer interactions. Incorporating peer-to-peer communication into digital interventions for this population may increase compliance with other evidence-based therapies by producing more acceptable and engaging online environments.",10.1176/appi.ps.201700283,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Psychiatry",NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.201700283)

Due to the easy access to information via electronical media, patients are primed in a heterogeneous manner concerning expectations and wishes regarding surgical interventions. Inherent to its nature elective interventions are critically questioned as there is time for information gathering and reflection. In this study, we set out to investigate the effect of an educational video as a supporting element in the process of informed consent giving for one the most frequently performed interventions in general surgery, namely inguinal hernia repair. Methods and analysis In a multicentre setup, eligible patients for primary inguinal hernia repair will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. All three groups will have a preoperative informed consent discussion with a physician in which they will eventually sign the informed consent sheet if participation is desired. Eventually, all three groups will get an online link. For two groups, the link will lead to a video with audiovisual information (an inguinal hernia video for the intervention group and a mock video for the control group). The intervention video provides basic principles of endoscopic extraperitoneal hernia repair. The second video is similar in length and design and displays general aspects of day surgery in the two study centres. All the three study groups will be provided with a copy of the informed consent form as it is standard by now. The third group's link will lead to the digital version of the informed consent brochure. Primary outcomes will consist of (1) score in a multiple choice test assessing gain of knowledge regarding hernia repair, (2) difference in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and (3) patient satisfaction questionnaire Individual Clinician Feedback (ICF, Picker Institute, Germany) as assessed 1-2 days after the first consultation. The study design guarantees double blinding, there will be no unblinding at any point. All patients will receive the same, quality and number of medical consultations as well as in the same surgical treatment. (Minor differences in the total extraperitoneal technique of the surgical treatment due to anatomical or pathophysiological differences are independent of the group allocation). Except for the additional videos, there will be no difference in in the information provided and the treatment prior, during or after the hernia repair.

Power of Mobile Peer Groups: A Design-Oriented Approach to Address Youth Unemployment,Not mental health,"Klier, J; Klier, M; Thiel, L; Agarwal, R",JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS,2019,"To investigate the societal value of digital peer groups in the context of youth unemployment, one of society's most pressing problems, we developed a novel mobile peer-group-based career counseling approach. Following a design-oriented methodology, we constructed an intervention in which we supplement offline one-on-one counseling sessions between youths and career counselors with mobile peer groups where youths can support one another in a trusting environment, independent of time and place. We evaluated the career counseling intervention, implemented on a WhatsApp platform, in a randomized field experiment conducted at the German Federal Employment Agency. Results suggest that the mobile peer-group-based career counseling approach offers substantial added value compared with traditional career counseling. It significantly increases a youth's chances of finding employment while improving his or her attitude towards career choice, career maturity, and career search intensity. Our study contributes to literature on the societal impacts of information and communication technologies and to research in design science.

Practice Patterns and Assessment of Needs for Pediatric Pain Management in Alberta Emergency Departments,Not Multi User,"Am, NB; Thull-Freedman, J; Ali, S",OPEN ACCESS EMERGENCY MEDICINE,2021,"Purpose: Many rural and community emergency departments (EDs) experience barriers to providing optimal pain care to children. In preparation for a quality improvement initiative, our team conducted a provincial pediatric pain management practice and needs assessment. Methods: An online survey was sent to ED administrators and educators from March to May 2017. Themes included pain assessment, pain and distress management strategies, available resources, education, barriers to care, and opportunities for improvement. Results: Forty-five respondents, from 31 EDs representing all five geographic health zones in Alberta, completed the survey. Use of a pain assessment tool was reported at 93.5% (29/31 sites) of the sites. Topical anesthesia was employed most of the time before suturing at 67% (18/27) of sites, versus 15% (4/27) before blood work or IV insertion. Eighty-one percent (22/27) of sites reported physically restraining children for procedures often, while 37% (10/27) reported use of comfort positioning often. Digital distraction devices were available at 37% (10/27) of sites. Reported challenges included lack of resources (33.3%, 12/36), staff education/knowledge (33.3%, 12/36), and absent policies/poor policy adherence (25.0%, 9/36). Opportunities for improvement included staff member education (73.5%, 25/34) and more resources (58.8%, 20/34). Respondents rated their site's overall ability to manage children's pain as 50/100 [IQR:21,61]. Conclusion: General EDs report providing suboptimal children's pain care, with use of physical restraint for medical procedures, and under-utilization of evidence-based, inexpensive treatment options.

Mental health recovery narratives are increasingly accessible, but their relevance to and effect on informal carers have been minimally investigated. The Narrative Experiences Online (NEON) Intervention is a first-in-field intervention that provides informal carers with access to a diverse collection of recorded mental health recovery narratives. This trial aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the NEON Intervention for informal carers.Methods This study involved a two-arm feasibility randomized controlled trial. Carers were randomly assigned to receiving versus not receiving the NEON Intervention. The feasibility aspects investigated included the acceptability of the intervention and of randomization, trial processes, engagement rates, recruitment procedures, attrition, sample size estimation, identification of candidate primary and secondary outcomes, and the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial.

Pre-Conception Interventions for Subfertile Couples Undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology Treatment: Modeling Analysis,Not mental health,"Steegers-Theunissen, R; Hoek, A; Groen, H; Bos, A; van den Dool, G; Schoonenberg, M; Smeenk, J; Creutzberg, E; Vecht, L; Starmans, L; Laven, J",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2020,"Background: Approximately 1 in 7 couples experience subfertility, many of whom have lifestyles that negatively affect fertility, such as poor nutrition, low physical activity, obesity, smoking, or alcohol consumption. Reducing lifestyle risk factors prior to pregnancy or assisted reproductive technology treatment contributes to the improvement of reproductive health, but cost-implications are unknown. Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate reproductive, maternal pregnancy, and birth outcomes, as well as the costs of pre-conception lifestyle intervention programs in subfertile couples and obese women undergoing assisted reproductive technology. Methods: Using a hypothetical model based on quantitative parameters from published literature and expert opinion, we evaluated the following lifestyle intervention programs: (1) Smarter Pregnancy, an online tool; (2) LIFEstyle, which provides outpatient support for obese women; (3) concurrent use of both Smarter Pregnancy and LIFEstyle for obese women; (4) smoking cessation in men; and (5) a mindfulness mental health support program using group therapy sessions. The model population was based on data from the Netherlands. Results: All model-based analyses of the lifestyle interventions showed a reduction in the number of in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or intrauterine insemination treatments required to achieve pregnancy and successful birth for couples in the Netherlands. Smarter Pregnancy was modeled to have the largest increase in spontaneous pregnancy rate (13.0%) and the largest absolute reduction in potential assisted reproductive technology treatments. Among obese subfertile women, LIFEstyle was modeled to show a reduction in the occurrence of gestational diabetes, maternal hypertensive pregnancy complications, and preterm births by 4.4%, 3.8%, and 3.0%, respectively, per couple. Modeled cost savings per couple per year were Euro41 (US $48.66), Euro360 (US $427.23), Euro513 (US $608.80), Euro586 (US $695.43), and Euro1163 (US $1380.18) for smoking cessation, mindfulness, Smarter Pregnancy, combined Smarter Pregnancy AND LIFEstyle, and LIFEstyle interventions, respectively. Conclusions: Although we modeled the potential impact on reproductive outcomes and costs of fertility treatment rather than collecting real-world data, our model suggests that of the lifestyle interventions for encouraging healthier behaviors, all are likely to be cost effective and appear to have positive effects on reproductive, maternal pregnancy, and birth outcomes. Further real-world data are required to determine the cost-effectiveness of pre-conception lifestyle interventions, including mobile apps and web-based tools that help improve lifestyle, and their effects on reproductive health. We believe that further implementation of the lifestyle app Smarter Pregnancy designed for subfertile couples seeking assistance to become pregnant is likely to be cost-effective and would allow reproductive health outcomes to be collected.",10.2196/19570,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,fertility; periconception; pregnancy chance; Smarter Pregnancy; cost-effectiveness; nutrition; obesity; IVF treatment; mobile and web-based lifestyle apps,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/19570)

Patient education is known to reduce anxiety. This study was performed to assess the effect of Virtual Reality (VR) as a means to educate patients to reduce pre-procedural anxiety in adult patients undergoing percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD).Methods and results: We randomly assigned 60 patients (48% male; age 44 +/- 11 years) with an indication for percutaneous PFO or ASD closure to receive pre-procedural education by their cardiologist (control) or to receive additional education through a VR information film depicting the day of the procedure (intervention). The pri-mary outcome was change in the pre-procedural anxiety as assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Amsterdam Pre-operative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS) questionnaires, filled-in during the outpatient clinic visit (baseline) and one week prior to the procedure (follow-up).

Prediction of Emotional States from Partial Facial Features for Virtual Reality Applications,Other,"Joudeh, IO; Cretu, AM; Bouchard, S; Guimond, S",ANNUAL REVIEW OF CYBERTHERAPY AND TELEMEDICINE,2023,"The availability of virtual reality (VR) in numerous clinical contexts has been made possible by recent technological advancements. One application is using VR for cognitive interventions with individuals who have mental disorders. Predicting the emotional states of users could help to prevent their discouragement during VR interventions. We can monitor the emotional states of individuals using sensors like an external camera, as they engage in various tasks within VR environments. The emotional state of VR users can be measured through arousal and valence, as per the Circumplex model. We used the Remote Collaborative and Affective Interactions (RECOLA) database of emotional behaviours. We processed video frames from 18 RECOLA videos. Due to the headset in VR systems, we detected faces and cropped the images of faces to use the lower half of the face only. We labeled the images with arousal and valence values to reflect various emotions. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically MobileNet-v2 and ResNets-18, were then used to predict arousal and valence values. MobileNet-v2 outperforms ResNet-18 as well as others from the literature. We achieved a root mean squared error (RMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), and Concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.1495, 0.6387, and 0.6081 for arousal, and 0.0996, 0.6453, and 0.6232 for valence. Our work acts as a proof-of-concept for predicting emotional states from arousal and valence values via visual data of users immersed in VR experiences.

Understanding which risk factors interrelate with dropping out from the studies provides the option to prevent dropout by tailoring effective strategies. Objective: This study aims to contribute an understanding of the predictors of web-based study dropout among psychosomatic rehabilitation patients. We investigated whether sociodemographics, voluntary interventions, physical and mental health, digital use for health and rehabilitation, and COVID-19 pandemic-related variables determine study dropout. Methods: Patients (N=2155) recruited from 4 psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics in Germany filled in a web-based questionnaire at T1, which was before their rehabilitation stay. Approximately half of the patients (1082/2155, 50.21%) dropped out at T2, which was after the rehabilitation stay, before and during which 3 voluntary digital trainings were provided to them. According to the number of trainings that the patients participated in, they were categorized into a comparison group or 1 of 3 intervention groups. Chi-square tests were performed to examine the differences between dropout patients and retained patients in terms of sociodemographic variables and to compare the dropout rate differences between the comparison and intervention groups. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess what factors were related to study dropout. Results: The comparison group had the highest dropout rate of 68.4% (173/253) compared with the intervention groups' dropout rates of 47.98% (749/1561), 50% (96/192), and 42.9% (64/149). Patients with a diagnosis of combined anxiety and depressive disorder had the highest dropout rate of 64% (47/74). Younger patients (those aged <50 y) and patients who were less educated were more likely to drop out of the study. Patients who used health-related apps and the internet less were more likely to drop out of the study. Patients who remained in their jobs and patients who were infected by COVID-19 were more likely to drop out of the study. Conclusions: This study investigated the predictors of dropout in web-based studies. Different factors such as patient sociodemographics, physical and mental health, digital use, COVID-19 pandemic correlates, and study design can correlate with the dropout rate.

"Preliminary impact of an mHealth education and social support intervention on maternal health knowledge and outcomes among postpartum mothers in Punjab, India",Good,"El Ayadi AM, Diamond-Smith NG, Duggal M, Singh P, Sharma P, Kaur J, Gopalakrishnan L, Gill N, Singh G, Ahuja A, Kumar V, Weil L, Bagga R.",Res Sq,2023,"Background.
Significant disruptions in the perinatal continuum of care occur postpartum in India, despite it being a critical time to optimize maternal health and wellbeing. Group-oriented mHealth approaches may help mitigate the impact of limited access to care and the lack of social support that characterize this period. Our team developed and pilot tested a provider-moderated group intervention to increase education, communication with providers, to refer participants to in-person care, and to connect them with a virtual social support group of other mothers with similarly aged infants through weekly calls and text chat.

Methods.
We analyzed the preliminary effectiveness of the pilot intervention on maternal health knowledge through 6 months postpartum among 135 participants in Punjab, India who responded to baseline and endline surveys. We described change in knowledge of maternal danger signs, birth preparedness, postpartum care use, postpartum physical and mental health, and family planning use over time between individuals in group call (synchronous), other intervention (asynchronous), and control groups.

Results.
Participant knowledge regarding danger signs was low overall regarding pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period (mean range of 1.13 to 2.05 at baseline and 0.79 to 2.10 at endline). Group call participants had a significantly higher increase over time in knowledge of danger signs than other intervention and control group participants. Birth preparedness knowledge ranged from mean 0.89–1.20 at baseline to 1.31–2.07 at baseline, with group call participants having significantly greater increases in comparison to the control group. Group call participants had nearly three-fold increased odds of postpartum health check with a clinical provider than other intervention participants (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.07–7.74). No differences were noted in postpartum depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Conclusions.
Preliminary effectiveness results are promising, yet further robust testing of the MeSSSSage intervention effectiveness is needed.

We assessed the feasibility of recruitment capability and study design and evaluated participants' impressions of the intervention using self-report rating scales and open-ended questions. We also descriptively examined distress and anxiety levels throughout the duration of the study. Results: Recruitment occurred between December 2021 and December 2022 and progressed slowly (rate: 1 participant/7 wk on average; some hesitancy because of stress and being overwhelmed). All participants who consented to participate completed the entire study. All participants were female and aged 56 (SD 10.56) years on average. In total, 57% (4/7) of the participants were assigned to the intervention group. On average, intervention participants spent 12 minutes engaged in the VR simulation. In general, the intervention was rated favorably (eg, clear information, enjoyable, and attractive presentation; mean% agreement 95.00-96.25, SD 4.79-10.00) and as helpful (mean% agreement 87.50, SD 25.00). Participants described the intervention as realistic (eg, It was realistic to my past surgical experiences), impacting their degree of preparedness and expectations for surgery (eg, The sounds and sights and procedures give you a test run; they prepare you for the actual day), and having a calming or relaxing effect (eg, You feel more relaxed for the surgery). Conclusions: This preoperative VR intervention demonstrated preliminary feasibility among a sample of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Results and participant feedback will inform modifications to the VR intervention and the study design of a large-scale randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of this intervention.

Preparing a Workforce of Care Coordinators to Address Patient Mental Health Needs in the Digital Age: Training and Needs Identification,Other,"Meyerhoff, J; Kruzan, KP; Reddy, M; Mohr, DC; Lattie, EG",SAGE OPEN NURSING,2023,"IntroductionCare coordinators (CCs) are specialized healthcare providers and often the primary point of contact for patients with multiple medical and mental health comorbidities in integrated healthcare settings. Prior work shows CCs have lower comfort addressing mental health than physical health concerns. Digital mental health interventions can support CCs' management of patient mental health needs, but training gaps must be addressed prior to a digital mental health intervention's implementation. MethodsAs part of a quality improvement initiative, a 1-hour training focused on the assessment and management of depression and suicide-related thoughts and behaviors was delivered to CCs within a large midwestern healthcare system's Division of Ambulatory Care Coordination. CCs completed online surveys prior to and following the training. ConclusionTraining resulted in increased comfort working with clinical populations, including patients who experience suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Gains around screening for suicide risk were modest. Brief trainings for CCs can address training gaps, however, ongoing training and case consultation may also be indicated.",10.1177/23779608231173279,wos,Nursing,mental health; suicide prevention; technology enabled services; implementation,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1177/23779608231173279)
Preventing depression using a smartphone app: a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Deady, M; Glozier, N; Calvo, R; Johnston, D; Mackinnon, A; Milne, D; Choi, I; Gayed, A; Peters, D; Bryant, R; Christensen, H; Harvey, SB",PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,2022,"Background There is evidence that depression can be prevented; however, traditional approaches face significant scalability issues. Digital technologies provide a potential solution, although this has not been adequately tested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new smartphone app designed to reduce depression symptoms and subsequent incident depression amongst a large group of Australian workers. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with follow-up assessments at 5 weeks and 3 and 12 months post-baseline. Participants were employed Australians reporting no clinically significant depression. The intervention group (N = 1128) was allocated to use HeadGear, a smartphone app which included a 30-day behavioural activation and mindfulness intervention. The attention-control group (N = 1143) used an app which included a 30-day mood monitoring component. The primary outcome was the level of depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9) at 3-month follow-up. Analyses were conducted within an intention-to-treat framework using mixed modelling. Results Those assigned to the HeadGear arm had fewer depressive symptoms over the course of the trial compared to those assigned to the control (F-3,F-734.7 = 2.98, p = 0.031). Prevalence of depression over the 12-month period was 8.0% and 3.5% for controls and HeadGear recipients, respectively, with odds of depression caseness amongst the intervention group of 0.43 (p = 0.001, 95% CI 0.26-0.70). Conclusions This trial demonstrates that a smartphone app can reduce depression symptoms and potentially prevent incident depression caseness and such interventions may have a role in improving working population mental health.

Priority Given to Technology in Government-Based Mental Health and Addictions Vision and Strategy Documents: Systematic Policy Review,Not Multi User,"Lal, S; Siafa, L; Lee, H; Adair, CE",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2021,"Background: The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to deliver mental health and addictions (MHA) services is a global priority, especially considering the urgent shift towards virtual delivery of care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to monitor the evolving role of technology in MHA services. Given that MHA policy documents represent the highest level of priorities for a government's vision and strategy for mental health care, one starting point is to measure the frequency with which technology is mentioned and the terms used to describe its use in MHA policy documents (before, during, and after COVID-19). Yet, to our knowledge, no such review of the extent to which ICTs are referred to in Canadian MHA policy documents exists to date. Objective: The objective of this systematic policy review was to examine the extent to which technology is addressed in Canadian government-based MHA policy documents prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to establish a baseline for documenting change. Methods: We reviewed 22 government-based MHA policy documents, published between 2011 and 2019 by 13 Canadian provinces and territories. We conducted content analysis to synthesize the policy priorities addressed in these documents into key themes, and then systematically searched for and tabulated the use of 39 technology-related keywords (in English and French) to describe and compare jurisdictions. Results: Technology was addressed in every document, however, to a varying degree. Of the 39 searched keywords, we identified 22 categories of keywords pertaining to the use of technology to deliver MHA services and information. The 6 most common categories were tele (n=16/22), phone (n=12/22), tech (n=11/22), online (n=10/22), line (n=10/22), and web (n=10/22), with n being the number of policy documents in which the category was mentioned out of 22 documents. The use of terms referring to advanced technologies, such as virtual (n=6/22) and app (n=4/22), were less frequent. Additionally, policy documents from some provinces and territories (eg, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador) mentioned a diverse range of ICTs, whereas others described only 1 form of ICT. Conclusions: This review indicates that technology has been given limited strategic attention in Canadian MHA policy. Policy makers may have limited knowledge on the evidence and potential of using technology in this field, highlighting the value for knowledge translation and collaborative initiatives among policy makers and researchers. The development of a pan-Canadian framework for action addressing the integration and coordination of technology in mental health services can also guide initiatives in this field. Our findings provide a prepandemic baseline and replicable methods to monitor how the use of technology-supported services and innovations emerge relative to other priorities in MHA policy during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",10.2196/25547,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,e-mental health; digital mental health; virtual care; technology; mental health; addictions; review; policy; e-health; mHealth; digital health; tele,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/25547)

Aim: We aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the study process and the use of VR for procedural pain management. Methods: From June 2016 to January 2017, we recruited children from 2 months to 10 years of age with burn injuries requiring a hydrotherapy session in a pediatric university teaching hospital in Montreal. Each child received the projector-based VR intervention in addition to the standard pharmacological treatment. Data on intervention and study feasibility and acceptability in addition to measures on pain (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale), baseline (Modified Smith Scale) and procedural (Procedure Behavior Check List) anxiety, comfort (OCCEB-BECCO [ behavioral observational scale of comfort level for child burn victims]), and sedation (Ramsay Sedation Scale) were collected before, during, and after the procedure. Data analyses included descriptive and non-parametric inferential statistics. Results: We recruited 15 children with a mean age of 2.2 +/- 2.1 years and a mean total body surface area of 5% (+/- 4). Mean pain score during the procedure was low (2.9/10, +/- 3), as was the discomfort level (2.9/10, +/- 2.8). Most children were cooperative, oriented, and calm. Assessing anxiety was not feasible with our sample of participants.

Prolonged grief disorder treatment: An approach to COVID-19 grief,Other,"Martínez-Medina, CB; Rodríguez-Orozco, AR",SALUD MENTAL,2023,"Background. It has been estimated that COVID-19 grief will affect approximately sixteen million people worldwide, while the prevalence of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) could rise to 40%. Objective. To review treatments that can be administered to patients with PGD due to COVID-19. Method. PUBMED and Google Scholar were searched with the following keywords: prolonged grief disorder, complicated grief, grief and psychotherapy, and treatment of prolonged grief, complicated grief or persistent complex grief. Results. Fifty articles were reviewed on the efficacy of interpersonal therapy, rational emotional-behavioral therapy, supportive therapy, humanistic therapy, systemic family therapy, group therapy, writing therapy, Internet-based intervention, and a modality of cognitive behavioral therapy used with prolonged grief, metacognitive therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Discussion and conclusion. There is no consensus on the psychotherapeutic treatment of choice for people with PGD due to the loss of a family member to COVID-19. Group therapy is effective in reducing the intensity of uncomplicated grief, cognitive-behavioral therapy is highly efficacious in reducing the severity of grief, metacognitive therapy specifically designed for PGD has a positive impact on depression, anxiety, stress, rumination, and quality of life while Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is helpful for restoring spirituality. Psychotherapy is most effective when combined with drug therapy. It is suggested that comparative studies be undertaken of psychotherapeutic techniques for managing patients with PGD associated with COVID-19 and the adaptation of these techniques to virtual settings.",10.17711/SM.0185-3325.2023.021,wos,Psychiatry,COVID-19; prolonged grief; treatment; cognitive behavioral therapy; psychotherapy,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.17711/SM.0185-3325.2023.021)

Wearables may enable continuous health care provider-patient partnerships and reduce the volume of episodic clinic-based care (thereby reducing health care costs). However, challenges arise from the unregulated use of these devices, including questionable data reliability, potential misinterpretation of information, unintended psychological impacts, and an influx of clinically nonactionable data that may overburden the health care system. Further, these technologies could exacerbate, rather than mitigate, health disparities. Experience with wearables in atrial fibrillation underscores these challenges.

Promoting Physical Activity With Self-Tracking and Mobile-Based Coaching for Cardiac Surgery Patients During the Discharge-Rehabilitation Gap: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Not mental health,"Zhang, C; Soliman-Hamad, M; Robijns, R; Verberkmoes, N; Verstappen, F; IJsselsteijn, WA",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2020,"Background: Home-based cardiac rehabilitations (CRs) with digital technologies have been researched and implemented to replace, augment, and complement traditional center-based CR in recent years with considerable success. One problem that technology-enhanced home-based CR can potentially address is the gap between cardiac interventions and formal CR programs. In the Netherlands and some other countries (eg, Australia), patients after cardiac interventions stay at home for 3-4 weeks without much support from their physicians, and often engage in very little physical activity (PA). A home-based exercise program enabled by digital technologies may help patients to better prepare for the later center-based CR programs, potentially increasing the uptake rate of those programs. Objective: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based walking exercise program enhanced by self-tracking and mobile-based coaching (treatment condition), comparing it with a version of the same program without these technologies (control condition). The added value of the digital technologies is justified if patients in the treatment group walk more steps on average (primary outcome) and show better physical fitness in a bicycle ergometer test and higher self-efficacy toward PA (secondary outcomes). Methods: Based on a power analysis, we will recruit 100 cardiac patients and assign them evenly to the 2 parallel groups. Eligible patients are those who are scheduled in the postanesthesia care unit, know the Dutch language, have basic literacy of using smartphones, and are without medical conditions that may increase risks associated with PA. In a face-to-face meeting with a nurse practitioner, all patients are prescribed a 3-week exercise program at home (2 walking exercises per day with increasing duration), based on national and international guidelines and tailored to their physical conditions after cardiac intervention. Their physical activities (daily steps) will be measured by the Axivity AX3 accelerometer worn at hip position. Patients in the treatment group will also be supported by a Neo Health One self-tracking device and a mobile platform called Heart Angel, through which they are monitored and coached by their nurses. After the study, all patients will perform a bicycle ergometer test and return the devices within 1 week. In addition, 5 questionnaires will be sent to the patients by emails to assess their self-efficacy toward PA and other psychological states for exploratory analyses (at discharge, at the end of each monitoring week, and 1 week after the study). To minimize bias, the randomization procedure will be performed after introducing the exercise program, so the nurse practitioners are blind to the experimental conditions until that point. Results: The study protocol has been approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committees United on February 26, 2018 (NL 62142.100.17/R17.51). By the end of 2018, we completed a small pilot study with 8 patients and the results based on interviews and app usage data suggest that a larger clinical trial with the targeted population is feasible. We expect to complete the RCT by the end of 2021, and statistical analyses will follow. Conclusions: Results of the RCT will help us to test the hypothesized benefits of self-tracking and mobile-based coaching for cardiac patients in home-based exercise programs during the discharge-rehabilitation gap. If the results are positive, cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed based on the insights of the study to inform the translation of the technology-enhanced program to clinical practice.

Promoting Smart and Safe Internet Use Among Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Their Parents,Other,"Good, B; Fang, L",CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK JOURNAL,2015,"Technological devices and the internet have become standard tools used by young people in their social, recreational and educational contexts. The utility of digital technology continues to expand and influence the ways young people socialize, learn about the world and develop and experiment with identity. The ability to remain in one's own home while also connecting with others can be perceived as safer than venturing out in the offline world; however, there are a variety of risks associated with online activities. Some youth may be more at risk of harm than others, such as youth with neurodevelopmental disorders including learning disabilities (LDs), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). There is an instinct for adults to be protective of children who struggle with disabilities, leading some parents to take an overprotective approach to their child's internet use. Parents can play a significant role in helping their children navigate the pitfalls associated with online use while enjoying the benefits it provides. In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of young people with neurodevelopmental disorders that may cause difficulties online and review the opportunities and risks associated with internet use. We then discuss ways for parents to provide effective and balanced guidance on internet use for their child by reviewing the literature and offering concepts on digital literacies.

Promoting Survivor Safety in Immigrant Communities: Online Simulation Training for Korean American Faith Leaders,Other,"Choi, YJ; Orpinas, P; Han, JY; Cho, S; Li, T; Kim, C",JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE,2023,"This study examined the efficacy of a short virtual case simulation for Korean American (KA) faith leaders, Religious Leaders for Healthy Families. The goal of the program is to increase knowledge about intimate partner violence (IPV) and healthy intimate partner relationships, enhance self-efficacy in IPV prevention and intervention, strengthen attitudes that support their roles on IPV prevention and intervention, increase positive outcome expectations of their actions, and increase behavioral intentions and behaviors on IPV prevention and intervention. KA faith leaders from two large metropolitan areas with a high concentration of KA immigrants were invited to participate in the study (N=102). Participants completed three online assessments: baseline, a 3-month, and a 6-month follow-up. After the baseline assessment, participants were randomized to either intervention (n = 53) or control (n = 49). The intervention consisted of four online simulation modules, each taking approximately 15-20 min to complete. At the 6-month follow-up, faith leaders in the intervention group significantly increased their knowledge and self-efficacy in IPV prevention and intervention compared to the control group. Mean scores for attitudes against IPV and prevention behaviors increased from baseline to the 6-month follow-up for the intervention group more than the control group, but the differences were not statistically significant. Religious Leaders for Healthy Families has the potential to reduce disparities in accessing resources and services for immigrant survivors of IPV. With its ease of use, this short, free online intervention has a high potential for uptake among faith leaders. Results are promising, but the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the study, with participants having scarce opportunities to practice the skills learned from the intervention.

However, the rates of PA among older adults remain a concern. While portable technologies hold promises in promoting PA, sustaining long-term engagement continues to be a challenge.ObjectiveThe aims of this study are to identify barriers and facilitators to PA in older adults, to develop an mHealth app promoting PA and an active healthy lifestyle in collaboration with community-dwelling older adults guided by the design thinking process, and to test it.MethodsA co-creative process was used, employing design thinking. Interviews were conducted to understand the needs of the target population and identify the problem of insufficient PA. Two cocreation sessions involving older adults and experts were conducted to generate innovative ideas. Participants were selected based on age (>= 65 years), no severe illness, Dutch language proficiency, and active participation ability. Results were qualitatively analyzed and coded. Finally a prototype was developed and tested.ResultsInterviews with older adults highlighted diverse perceptions of PA but unanimous agreement on its importance. They recognized health benefits such as improved mobility, balance, and reduced fall risk, while emphasizing the social and mental aspects. Barriers included poor health, time constraints, weather conditions and fear of falling. Cocreation sessions identified key topics: perception of a healthy lifestyle, coping strategies, mHealth App features, screen visualization, and tailored notifications, which led to the development of a mobile app promoting PA and an active lifestyle. The app was stepwise prototyped.ConclusionThis study emphasizes the importance of promoting PA among older adults through a collaborative design thinking approach. However, the implementation of mHealth apps faces obstacles due to the digital divide, necessitating personalized solutions to bridge the gap. Moreover, it calls for further research to investigate the long-term impact of such interventions and explore behavior change patterns in this population.",10.3389/fpubh.2023.1280941,wos,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",design thinking method; digital technology; physical activity; older adults; mobile application; mHealth; motivation; participatory design,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1280941)
Promoting psychological health in women with SCI: Development of an online self-esteem intervention,Good,"Robinson-Whelen, S; Hughes, RB; Taylor, HB; Markley, R; Vega, JC; Nosek, TM; Nosek, MA",DISABILITY AND HEALTH JOURNAL,2020,"Background: There are no known interventions addressing self-esteem in women following spinal cord injury (SCI). Objectives: To test the feasibility of an online self-esteem intervention for women with disabilities, as modified for women with SCI. Method: We conducted a randomized, controlled feasibility test of a self-esteem intervention (N = 21). Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group that received intervention materials at the end of the study. Intervention participants met as avatars for 7 weekly real-time group sessions in Second Life (SL), a free online virtual world. Feasibility indicators were study engagement, acceptability of SL and the intervention, and improvements on measures of psychological health promoting behaviors, social support, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and depression. Results: Intervention participants (n = 10) were highly engaged, and most described the SL program as more enjoyable and more convenient than in-person programs. All rated the intervention as good (n = 4) or very good (n = 6), and all 10 rated themselves has having made positive life changes as a result of the program. Intervention participants experienced significantly greater change than controls on two measures of health-promoting behavior (Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile-II Spiritual Growth/Self-actualization; Interpersonal Relations). Examining change in the intervention group using regression analyses, we found medium-to-large effects of the intervention on these behaviors and measures of depression (CESD-10, PHQ-9). The intervention had small effects on remaining measures. Conclusion: We found preliminary support for the feasibility of this modified self-esteem intervention offered in SL. Such programming may help circumvent barriers to community-based psychological services and may improve psychological health. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Prospective Evaluation of a Clinical Decision Support System in Psychological Therapy,Not mental health,"Lutz, W; Deisenhofer, AK; Rubel, J; Bennemann, B; Giesemann, J; Poster, K; Schwartz, B",JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY,2022,"Public Health Significance Statement This randomized clinical implementation trial provides insight into the evaluation of a clinical decision support and feedback system including personalized pretherapy recommendations and enhanced psychometric feedback during treatment. As it is one of the first decision systems to have been implemented and evaluated prospectively in mental health, this study helps to improve such systems designed to support and change the way psychotherapy is conducted. The results underscore the importance of high-quality implementation of digital decision support tools in clinical practice. Objective: Thus far, most applications in precision mental health have not been evaluated prospectively. This article presents the results of a prospective randomized-controlled trial investigating the effects of a digital decision support and feedback system, which includes two components of patient-specific recommendations: (a) a clinical strategy recommendation and (b) adaptive recommendations for patients at risk for treatment failure. Method: Therapist-patient dyads (N = 538) in a cognitive behavioral therapy outpatient clinic were randomized to either having access to a decision support system (intervention group; n = 335) or not (treatment as usual; n = 203). First, treatment strategy recommendations (problem-solving, motivation-oriented, or a mix of both strategies) for the first 10 sessions were evaluated. Second, the effect of psychometric feedback enhanced with clinical problem-solving tools on treatment outcome was investigated. Results: The prospective evaluation showed a differential effect size of about 0.3 when therapists followed the recommended treatment strategy in the first 10 sessions. Moreover, the linear mixed models revealed therapist symptom awareness and therapist attitude and confidence as significant predictors of an outcome as well as therapist-rated usefulness of feedback as a significant moderator of the feedback-outcome and the not on track-outcome associations. However, no main effects were found for feedback. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the importance of prospective studies and the high-quality implementation of digital decision support tools in clinical practice. Therapists seem to be able to learn from such systems and incorporate them into their clinical practice to enhance patient outcomes, but only when implementation is successful.",10.1037/ccp0000642,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,outcome monitoring; precision mental health; digital decision support; feedback; clinical support tools,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1037/ccp0000642)
Protocol for randomized control trial of a digital-assisted parenting intervention for promoting Malaysian children's mental health,Population,"Zulkefly, NS; Schaff, ARD; Zaini, NA; Mukhtar, F; Norowi, NM; Dahlan, R; Said, SM",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2022,"Background: Mental illness among Malaysian children is gradually reaching a fundamentally alarming point as it persistently shows increasing trend. The existing literature on the etiologies of children's mental illness, highlights the most common cause to be ineffective or impaired parenting. Thus, efforts to combat mental illness in children should focus on improving the quality of parenting. Documented interventional studies focusing on this issue, particularly in Malaysia, are scarce and commonly report poor treatment outcomes stemming from inconvenient face-to-face instructions. Consequently, proposing an accessible online and digital-assisted parenting program is expected to reach a larger number of parents, as it can overcome substantial barriers. Hence, this study aims to develop a universal digital-assisted preventive parenting intervention called DaPI, that aims to enhance mental health of children in Malaysia. Methods: A total of 200 parents of children aged 10-14 years will be recruited and randomized into two groups either intervention or waitlist-control based on a 1:1 ratio for a duration of 8 weeks. Those in the intervention group will receive eight sessions of the DaPI program that focus mainly on parenting and children's mental health. The primary outcome of this study will essentially focus on the changes in parent-reported parenting behavior and parental self-efficacy. The secondary outcome will be changes in children's mental health (i.e., behavioral problems and emotional maladjustment). Assessments will be arranged pre- and post-intervention as well as at the 1-month follow-up. Analyses will be conducted using a paired t-test and multivariate analysis of covariance. Discussion: The expected outcome will be the establishment of DaPI in promoting children's mental health by targeting changes in parenting behavior and parental self-efficacy in Malaysia. Findings from this study will be beneficial for policymakers to invest in parenting programs that could provide support to parents in enhancing their child's overall development.",10.3389/fpsyg.2022.928895,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,online parenting intervention; parenting; children mental health; digital-assisted intervention; Malaysia,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.928895)

Patients with cancer, already at risk for poor mental health outcomes, are not expected to be spared from these consequences, prompting the need for health services to improve responsiveness. This article presents the research protocol for an implementation study designed to describe the uptake of a well-studied and recognized system for the treatment of depression and anxiety (Stepped-care) during the specific context of a Pandemic in an oncological site. The system set-up will be assisted by a digital platform (MoodUP), where patients undergoing cancer treatment will be screened for anxiety and depressive symptoms, triaged by severity level and algorithm-matched to recommended interventions. Patients undergoing cancer treatment at a cancer clinic in Portugal will be invited to subscribe to the MoodUP platform where they will complete a self-reported questionnaire (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) to screen their anxiety and depressive symptoms. Data will be instantly collected, and an algorithm will activate severity-matched intervention suggestions, through a case manager that will coordinate care. The specific objectives of this study will be to describe the implementation and acceptability of the care system by patients and staff, the barriers to and facilitators of implementation, the proportion of patients accessing the system and their pathways through the various stepped-care interventions, and patient perceptions regarding the feasibility and appropriateness of the eHealth platform. Moreover, exploratory analyses will be conducted to describe patterns of anxiety and depression symptoms variation across all patients, as well as within sociodemographically, clinically and contextually characterized subgroups, to characterize their care needs and access, as well as to explore for whom the MoodUP care system may be more appropriate.

This protocol describes the Play Love And You (PLAY) Study, a phase 1 trial of an intervention designed to promote infant development through encouraging maternal self-efficacy using behavioural feedback, and supportive interventions.Methods and analysis 210 mother-infant pairs will be recruited at delivery from community clinics in Soweto, South Africa, and individually randomised (1:1) into two groups. The trial will consist of a standard of care arm and an intervention arm. The intervention will start at birth and end at 12 months, and outcome assessments will be made when the infants are 0, 6 and 12 months of age. The intervention will be delivered by community health helpers using an app with resource material, telephone calls, in person visits and behavioural feedback with individualised support. Every 4 months, mothers in the intervention group will receive rapid feedback via the app and in person on their infant's movement behaviours and on their interaction styles with their infant. At recruitment, and again at 4 months, mothers will be screened for mental health risk and women who score in the high-risk category will receive an individual counselling session from a licensed psychologist, followed by referral and continued support as necessary. The primary outcome is efficacy of the intervention in improving maternal self-efficacy, and the secondary outcomes are infant development at 12 months, and feasibility and acceptability of each component of the intervention.Ethics and dissemination The PLAY Study has received ethical approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand (M220217).

Providing Japanese health care information for international visitors: digital animation intervention,Not Multi User,"Nishikawa, M; Yamanaka, M; Kiriya, J; Jimba, M",BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,2018,"Background: Over 24 million international visitors came to Japan in 2016 and the number is expected to increase. Visitors could be at a risk of illness or injury that may result in hospitalization in Japan. We assessed the effects of a four-minute digital animation titled Mari Info Japan on the level of anxiety experienced by international visitors to Japan. Methods: We conducted a non-randomized, controlled study at Narita International Airport outside Tokyo in December 2014. On the first day, we recruited international visitors for the intervention group at predetermined departure gates and, the following day, we sampled visitors for the control group at the same gates. We repeated this procedure twice over 4 days. The intervention group watched the digital animation and the control group read a standard travel guidebook in English. After receiving either intervention, they completed a questionnaire on their level of anxiety. The outcome was assessed using the Mari Meter-X, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y (STAI-Y), and a face scale, before and immediately after the intervention. We analyzed data with Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results: We recruited 265 international visitors (134 in the intervention group, 131 in the control group), 241 (91%) of whom completed the questionnaire. Most of them had no previous Japanese health information before arrival in Japan. The level of anxiety about health services in Japan was significantly reduced in the intervention group (Mari Meter-X median: -5 and 0, p < 0.001 and STAI-Y median: -3 and 0, p < 0.001). The face scale analysis showed no significant difference. Conclusions: Watching a digital animation is more effective in reducing anxiety among international visitors to Japan compared with reading a standard brochure or guidebook. Such effective animations of health information should be more widely distributed to international visitors.",10.1186/s12913-018-3191-x,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services,Digital animation; Health information; International visitors; Japan,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-018-3191-x)
Providing Psychological and Emotional Support After Perinatal Loss: Protocol for a Virtual Reality-Based Intervention,Not Multi User,"Corno, G; Bouchard, S; Baños, RM; Rivard, MC; Verdon, C; de Montigny, F",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2020,"The loss of an infant during the perinatal period has been recognized as a complex and potentially traumatic life event and can have a significant impact on women's mental health. However, often times, psychological aftercare is typically not offered, and manualized interventions are rarely used in clinical care practice and have seldom been evaluated. In recent years, a growing number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) interventions to facilitate the expression and coping with emotions linked to a traumatic event. The objective of the proposed paper is to present the protocol of a randomized control trial aimed to assess a novel VR-based intervention for mothers who experienced a perinatal loss. We hypothesize that the VR-based intervention group will show significantly reduced symptoms related to grief, postnatal depression and general psychopathology after treatment relative to a treatment-as-usual (TAU) group. Participants would be randomly assigned to the TAU + VR or to the VR + TAU condition. The TAU condition as well as the VR-based intervention will last 3 weeks, after which women will complete a post-assessment. The proposed VR-based intervention will consist in three weekly sessions focused, respectively on: (1) collect information about the loss and psychoeducation about perinatal grief, and introduction to the virtual environment; (2) through the use of the virtual environment, women will be assisted in the elaboration and acceptation of loss; (3) recreate, using the specific features of the virtual environment a positive metaphor representing woman's future life. VR has proved to be a valid intervention tool in clinical psychology, and in the last years VR technologies have become more affordable to be used in clinical practice. With the present study we propose to answer to the unquestionable need for interventions addressed to ameliorate the emotional effects in women who experienced perinatal loss, by exploiting also the therapeutic opportunities offered by a new technology as VR.",10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01262,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,perinatal loss and grief; intervention; virtual reality; women mental health; psychological intervention,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01262)
Psychiatric diagnosis and treatment in the 21st century: paradigm shifts versus incremental integration,Good,"Stein, DJ; Shoptaw, SJ; Vigo, DV; Lund, C; Cuijpers, P; Bantjes, J; Sartorius, N; Maj, M",WORLD PSYCHIATRY,2022,"Psychiatry has always been characterized by a range of different models of and approaches to mental disorder, which have sometimes brought progress in clinical practice, but have often also been accompanied by critique from within and without the field. Psychiatric nosology has been a particular focus of debate in recent decades; successive editions of the DSM and ICD have strongly influenced both psychiatric practice and research, but have also led to assertions that psychiatry is in crisis, and to advocacy for entirely new paradigms for diagnosis and assessment. When thinking about etiology, many researchers currently refer to a biopsychosocial model, but this approach has received significant critique, being considered by some observers overly eclectic and vague. Despite the development of a range of evidence-based pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies, current evidence points to both a treatment gap and a research-practice gap in mental health. In this paper, after considering current clinical practice, we discuss some proposed novel perspectives that have recently achieved particular prominence and may significantly impact psychiatric practice and research in the future: clinical neuroscience and personalized pharmacotherapy; novel statistical approaches to psychiatric nosology, assessment and research; deinstitutionalization and community mental health care; the scale-up of evidence-based psychotherapy; digital phenotyping and digital therapies; and global mental health and task-sharing approaches. We consider the extent to which proposed transitions from current practices to novel approaches reflect hype or hope. Our review indicates that each of the novel perspectives contributes important insights that allow hope for the future, but also that each provides only a partial view, and that any promise of a paradigm shift for the field is not well grounded. We conclude that there have been crucial advances in psychiatric diagnosis and treatment in recent decades; that, despite this important progress, there is considerable need for further improvements in assessment and intervention; and that such improvements will likely not be achieved by any specific paradigm shifts in psychiatric practice and research, but rather by incremental progress and iterative integration.",10.1002/wps.20998,wos,Psychiatry,Mental disorder; psychiatric nosology; clinical neuroscience; personalized psychiatry; Research Domain Criteria; Hierarchical Tax-onomy of Psychopathology; deinstitutionalization; community mental health care; evidence-based psychotherapy; digital phenotyping; digital therapies; global mental health; task-sharing approaches; paradigm shifts; incremental integration,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1002/wps.20998)

Psychological Dimensions of COVID-19: Perspectives for the Practicing Clinician,Not Multi User,"Paric, A; Ravindran, L; Ravindran, A",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES,2020,"For most individuals, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a novel and anxiety provoking experience. With ongoing outbreaks in many regions around the globe, it has led to worldwide social distancing measures, travel restrictions, job and financial losses, and depletion of resources. In addition, morbidity and mortality of the infection with mental health sequelae including health-related anxiety, depression, and traumatic-related conditions are common. Such adverse mental health consequences clearly have a bidirectional relationship with the infection's presence, and thus, there is a need to recognize and address such complications to optimize care. The perspectives outlined here are based on a review of literature regarding past infectious outbreaks, current experiences with the ongoing pandemic, and their effects on psychological well-being and clinical practice. They attempt to provide a framework that integrates the mental, physical, and social domains of the COVID-19 pandemic and their interrelationships. Thus, it is recommended that management includes a psychological component, and evidence supports the use of psychoeducation and social support groups to mitigate the adverse psychological effects of the pandemic.

Psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis,Not mental health,"Dawson, S; Girling, CJ; Cowap, L; Clark-Carter, D",COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,2023,"Background Adherence to treatment, including inhaled therapies, is low in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF have been developed, no previous published systematic review has evaluated the evidence for efficacy of these interventions. Objectives The primary objective of the review was to assess the efficacy of psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The secondary objective was to establish the most effective components, or behaviour change techniques (BCTs), used in these interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched databases (PubMed; PsycINFO; EBSCO; Scopus; OpenGrey), trials registries (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov), and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, with no restrictions on language, year or publication status. Date of search: 7 August 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different types of psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF of any age, or comparing psychological interventions with usual care. We included quasi-RCTs if we could reasonably assume that the baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and completed data extraction, risk of bias assessments, and BCT coding (using the BCT Taxonomy v1) for all included trials. We resolved any discrepancies by discussion, or by consultation with a third review author as necessary. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We are uncertain whether motivational interviewing (MI) was better or worse than education plus problem-solving (EPS) at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments. Background CF is a chronic, genetic condition, usually diagnosed at birth through newborn screening. People with CF experience recurrent chest infections due to the build-up of thick, sticky mucus (or sputum) in their lungs and digestive systems. Inhaled treatments are usually prescribed to either thin sputum (making it easier to clear or cough up), or to treat and control bacteria in the lungs (to reduce infections). People living with any long-term health condition often struggle to take the number of treatments they are prescribed, and this is no different in CF. What did we want to find out? Can psychological interventions help people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, and are there any harmful or unwanted effects of these interventions (e.g. anxiety or depression)? Which techniques (e.g. goal-setting, problem-solving) work best at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments? What did we do? We searched for studies comparing different types of psychological interventions, or comparing the interventions with usual care, for helping people with CF of any age to take their inhaled treatments. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the trial methods. What did we find? We included 10 trials with 1642 people with CF (approximately 54.3% female). Four trials included children and adolescents; five trials included adults; and one trial included both. Nine trials compared a psychological intervention with usual care, and one study compared two psychological interventions (MI versus EPS). People (or in one trial, CF centres) were randomly selected for one group or the other. People were followed up for between six to eight weeks and 23 months. Psychological interventions were wide-ranging. They included an intervention that combined digital technology (website or app) with support from trained healthcare professionals. Interventions used a range of techniques, with problem-solving and providing instructions on how to take treatments being the most commonly used. Main results Psychological interventions are probably better than usual care at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, and may cause little or no harm (e.g. anxiety or depression) when measured six to 12 months after treatment. Psychological interventions may also improve perceived treatment burden (as measured using a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in terms of lung function (a measure of how well someone's lungs are working), the number of chest infections, or perceived chest symptoms (again measured using a QoL questionnaire). We are uncertain whether MI was better or worse than EPS at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, improving lung function or QoL, or reducing chest infections in people with CF. The included trial did not look at whether MI or EPS caused harm (e.g. anxiety or depression). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence for psychological interventions being better or worse than usual care ranges from low to moderate. The biggest included trial of psychological interventions (which had results from between six and 12 months after treatment started) focused on adults with CF (aged 16 years and over), whereas the question we wanted to answer was broader (i.e. we cannot be sure if the results would be the same in children). Large trials with a longer follow-up period (e.g. 12 months) are needed in children with CF. It is possible that because people completing the outcome assessments knew which group they were in, this might affect the results for QoL, anxiety and depression. We are not confident in the evidence comparing MI with EPS. The only trial examining this included a small number of adults, so we cannot be sure if the results would be the same in children or in a larger group of people. We are unsure whether participants were put into the different treatment groups truly at random, so differences between the groups might be due to differences between people rather than the treatments. We are also unsure about people leaving the trial early and how this might affect the results. We also think that because the people completing the outcome assessments knew which group they were in, this might affect the QoL results. Current evidence on which techniques (e.g. goal-setting, problem-solving) work best at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments is limited. Future trials should provide more details on the techniques used in interventions. How up to date is this evidence?

Considerable additional research in the area has been published since that time. Objectives To provide an update to our 2006 review assessing the efficacy of psychological interventions for needle-related procedural pain and distress in children and adolescents. Search methods Searches of the following databases were conducted for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs): Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; PsycINFO; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and Web of Science. Requests for relevant studies were also posted on various electronic list servers. We ran an updated search in March 2012, and again in March 2013. Selection criteria Participants included children and adolescents aged two to 19 years undergoing needle-related procedures. Only RCTs with at least five participants in each study arm comparing a psychological intervention group with a control or comparison group were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality and a third author helped with data extraction and coding for one non-English study. Included studies were coded for quality using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool. Standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were computed for all analyses using Review Manager 5.2 software. Main results Thirty-nine trials with 3394 participants were included. The most commonly studied needle procedures were venipuncture, intravenous (IV) line insertion, and immunization. Studies included children aged two to 19 years, with the most evidence available for children under 12 years of age. Consistent with the original review, the most commonly studied psychological interventions for needle procedures were distraction, hypnosis, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The majority of included studies (19 of 39) examined distraction only. The additional studies from this review update continued to provide strong evidence for the efficacy of distraction and hypnosis. No evidence was available to support the efficacy of preparation and information, combined CBT (at least two or more cognitive or behavioural strategies combined), parent coaching plus distraction, suggestion, or virtual reality for reducing children's pain and distress. No conclusions could be drawn about interventions of memory alteration, parent positioning plus distraction, blowing out air, or distraction plus suggestion, as evidence was available from single studies only. In addition, the Risk of bias scores indicated several domains with high or unclear bias scores (for example, selection, detection, and performance bias) suggesting that the methodological rigour and reporting of RCTs of psychological interventions continue to have considerable room for improvement. Authors' conclusions Overall, there is strong evidence supporting the efficacy of distraction and hypnosis for needle-related pain and distress in children and adolescents, with no evidence currently available for preparation and information or both, combined CBT, parent coaching plus distraction, suggestion, or virtual reality. Additional research is needed to further assess interventions that have only been investigated in one RCT to date (that is, memory alteration, parent positioning plus distraction, blowing out air, and distraction plus suggestion). There are continuing issues with the quality of trials examining psychological interventions for needle-related pain and distress.",10.1002/14651858.CD005179.pub3,"pubmed, wos",General & Internal Medicine,"Needles; Anxiety [prevention & control; psychology]; Cognitive Therapy [methods]; Hypnosis; Pain [prevention & control; psychology]; Punctures [psychology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans",URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005179.pub3)

Psychological treatment of social anxiety disorder: a meta-analysis,Other,"Acarturk, C; Cuijpers, P; van Straten, A; de Graaf, R",PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,2009,"Background. Older meta-analyses of the effects of psychological treatments of social anxiety disorder have found that these treatments have moderate to large effects. However, these earlier meta-analyses also included non-randomized studies, and there are many featured studies in this area which were published after the recent meta-analysis. Method. We conducted a systematic literature search and identified 29 randomized studies examining the effects of psychological treatments, with a total of 1628 Subjects. The quality of studies varied. For the analyses, we used the Computer program COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS (version 2.2.021; Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). Results. The mean effect size on social anxiety measures (47 contrast groups) was 0.70, 0.80 on cognitive measures (26 contrast groups) and 0.70 both on depression (19 contrast groups) and general anxiety measures (16 contrast groups). We found some heterogeneity, so we conducted a series of subgroup analyses for different variables of the studies. Studies with waiting-list control groups had significantly larger effect sizes than studies with placebo and treatment-as-usual control groups. Studies aimed at subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria for social anxiety disorder had smaller effect sizes than Studies in which other inclusion criteria were used. Conclusions. This study once more makes it clear that psychological treatments of social anxiety disorder are effective in adults, but that they may be less effective in more severe disorders and in studies in which care-as-usual and placebo control groups are used.",10.1017/S0033291708003590,wos,Psychology; Psychiatry,Meta-analysis; randomized studies; social anxiety disorder,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291708003590)

Objective: This study aims to evaluate the patterns of psychophysiological reactions of adults after the consumption of internet-based fluoride-related information and disinformation. Methods: A 2-armed, single-blinded, parallel, and randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 58 parents or caregivers of children who attend the Clinics of Pediatric Dentistry at the Bauru School of Dentistry, considering an attrition of 10% and a significance level of 5%. The participants will be randomized into test and intervention groups, being respectively exposed to fluoride-related information and disinformation presented on a computer with simultaneous monitoring of their psychophysiological reactions, including analysis of their heart rates (HRs) and 7 facial features (mouth outer, mouth corner, eye area, eyebrow activity, face area, face motion, and facial center of mass). Then, participants will respond to questions about the utility and truthfulness of content, their emotional state after the experiment, eHealth literacy, oral health knowledge, and socioeconomic characteristics. The Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests will be used to determine the normality and homogeneity of the data, which could lead to further statistical analyses for elucidating significant differences between groups, using parametric (Student t test) or nonparametric (Mann-Whitney U test) analyses. Moreover, multiple logistic regression models will be developed to evaluate the association of distinct variables with the psychophysiological aspects. Only factors with significant Wald statistics in the simple analysis will be included in the multiple models (P<.2). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis will be performed to determine the accuracy of the remote HR with respect to the measured HR. For all analyses, P<.05 will be considered significant. Results: From June 2022, parents and caregivers who frequent the Clinics of Pediatric Dentistry at the Bauru School of Dentistry will be invited to participate in the study and will be randomized into 1 of the 2 groups (control or intervention). Data collection is expected to be completed in December 2023. Subsequently, the authors will analyze the data and publish the findings of the clinical trial by June 2024.

Psychosocial Assessment Using Telehealth in Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer: A Partially Randomized Patient Preference Pilot Study,Not Multi User,"Chalmers, JA; Sansom-Daly, UM; Patterson, P; McCowage, G; Anazodo, A",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2018,"Background: Adolescent and young adults with cancer are at increased risk of psychosocial difficulties relative to their healthy peers. Current models of inpatient face-to-face psychosocial care might limit the capacity for clinicians to provide timely and personalized assessment and intervention for this group. Telehealth offers a promising alternative toward increasing access to the provision of evidence-based psychosocial assessment and treatment for adolescent and young adults with cancer. Objective: This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability for both patients and clinicians of providing a psychosocial assessment via telehealth to adolescents and young adults currently receiving treatment for cancer, relative to face-to-face delivery. Methods: We included patients who were aged 15-25 years, currently receiving treatment, could speak English well, and medically stable. Patients were recruited from oncology clinics or wards from 5 hospitals located across Sydney and Canberra, Australia, and allocated them to receive psychosocial assessment (Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology Psychosocial Assessment Measure) with a clinical psychologist or social worker through face-to-face or telehealth modalities using a partially randomized patient preference model. Patients completed a pre- and postassessment questionnaire comprising validated and purposely designed feasibility and acceptability indices, including the impact of technical difficulties, if patients had their own devices; number of patients who were content with their group allocation; self-reported preference of modality; Treatment Credibility and Expectations Questionnaire; and Working Alliance Inventory. Clinicians also completed a postassessment questionnaire rating their impressions of the acceptability and feasibility of intervention delivery by each modality. Results: Of 29 patients approached, 23 consented to participate (response rate: 79%). Participants were partially randomized to either telehealth (8/23, 35%; mean age 16.50 years, range 15-23 years; females: 4/8, 50%) or face-to-face (11/23, 62%; mean age 17 years, range 15-22 years; females: 8/11, 72%) conditions. Four participants withdrew consent because of logistical or medical complications (attrition rate: 17.4%). Most participants (6/8, 75%) in the telehealth group used their computer or iPad (2 were provided with an iPad), with minor technical difficulties occurring in 3 of 8 (37.5%) assessments. Participants in both groups rated high working alliance (Working Alliance Inventory; median patient response in the telehealth group, 74, range 59-84 and face-to-face group, 63, range 51-84) and reported positive beliefs regarding the credibility and expectations of their treatment group. Postassessment preferences between face-to-face or telehealth modalities varied. Most patients in the telehealth group (5/8, 63%) reported no preference, whereas 6 of 11 (55%) in the face-to-face group reported a preference for the face-to-face modality. Conclusions: Telehealth is acceptable as patient comfort was comparable across modalities, with no significant technological barriers experienced.

Psychosocial curating: a theory and practice of exhibition-making at the intersection between health and aesthetics,Population,"Bartlett, V",MEDICAL HUMANITIES,2020,"A recent Manifesto for a Visual Medical Humanities suggested that more in-depth analysis of the contribution of visual art to medical humanities is urgently required. This need perhaps arises because artists and curators experience conflict between the experimental approaches and tacit knowledge that drive their practice and existing audience research methods used in visitor studies or arts marketing. In this paper, I adopt an innovative psychosocial method-uniquely suited to evidencing aesthetic experiences-to examine how an exhibition of my own curation facilitated audiences to undertake psychological processing of complex ideas about mental distress. I consider the curator working in a health context as a creator of care-driven environments where complex affects prompted by aesthetic approaches to illness can be digested and processed. My definition of care is informed by psychosocial studies and object relations psychoanalysis, which allows me to approach my exhibitions as supportive structures that enable a spectrum of affects and emotions to be encountered. The key argument of the paper is that concepts from object relations psychoanalysis can help to rethink the point of entanglement between curating and health as a process of preparing the ground for audiences to do generative psychological work with images and affects. The case study is Group Therapy: Mental Distress in a Digital Age, an exhibition that was iterated at FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology), UK and University of New South Wales Galleries Sydney, with an emphasis on audience response to key artworks such as Madlove-A Designer Asylum (2015) by the vacuum cleaner and Hannah Hull.

Methods: Thirty-eight adolescents participated in a controlled trial with GH/GnRHa treatment or no intervention. Each year the adolescents and their parents completed questionnaires and structured interviews. Multilevel analysis was used to analyze data. Results: The adolescents of the treatment group showed a worse outcome than the adolescents of the control group on 3 of 16 variables: perceived competence of scholastic (p < 0.01) and athletic ability (p < 0.05) and trait anxiety (p < 0.05). Adolescents in both the treatment and control groups perceived improved current height (p < 0.001) and self-appraisal of physical appearance (p < 0.05). The parents did not report changes in their children during treatment. Conclusion: The observation of some adverse psychological consequences as experienced by the adolescents indicates that it is useful to monitor psychosocial functioning during a combined GH/GnRHa treatment in adolescents with ISS or SGA. It is uncertain whether the hypothesized positive effects of the expected gain in final height by adulthood can sufficiently counterbalance possible short-term negative effects. Copyright (C) 2005 S.

Psychosocial wellbeing shortly after allocation to a freeze-all strategy compared with a fresh transfer strategy in women and men: a sub-study of a randomized controlled trial,Not Digital,"Pilegaard, SP; Schmidt, L; Stormlund, S; Koert, E; Bogstad, JW; Prætorius, L; Nielsen, HS; Freiesleben, NL; Sopa, N; Klajnbard, A; Humaidan, P; Bergh, C; Englund, ALM; Lossl, K; Pinborg, A",HUMAN REPRODUCTION,2023,"STUDY QUESTION Is the psychosocial wellbeing affected in women and men shortly after allocation to a freeze-all strategy with postponement of embryo transfer compared to a fresh transfer strategy?SUMMARY ANSWER In general, psychosocial wellbeing (i.e. emotional reactions to the treatment, quality-of-life, infertility-related stress, and marital benefit) was similar in women and men allocated to a freeze-all versus those allocated to a fresh-transfer strategy 6 days after disclosure of treatment strategy (i.e. 4 days after oocyte retrieval), although women in the freeze-all group reported a slightly higher degree of depressive symptoms and mood swings compared to women in the fresh transfer group.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY The use of a freeze-all strategy, i.e. freezing of the entire embryo cohort followed by elective frozen embryo transfer in subsequent cycles has increased steadily over the past decade in assisted reproductive technology (ART). This strategy essentially eliminates the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and has proven beneficial regarding some reproductive outcomes in subgroups of women. However, patients experience a longer time interval between oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer, hence a longer time to pregnancy, possibly adding additional stress to the ART treatment. So far, little focus has been on the possible psychosocial strains caused by postponement of embryo transfer.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This is a self-reported questionnaire based sub-study of a multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) including 460 women and 396 male partners initiating their first, second, or third treatment cycle of invitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) from May 2016 to September 2018. This sub-study was included in the primary project protocol and project plan for the RCT, as psychosocial wellbeing was considered a secondary outcome.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Women from eight public fertility clinics in Denmark and Sweden and one private clinic in Spain were randomized in a 1:1 ratio on the day of inclusion (menstrual cycle day 2 or 3) to either a freeze-all strategy with postponement of embryo transfer to a subsequent modified natural menstrual cycle or a fresh transfer strategy with embryo transfer in the hormone stimulated cycle. Treatment allocation was blinded until the day of the ovulation trigger. Women and their male partners were asked to complete a validated self-reported questionnaire 6 days after unblinding of treatment group allocation, corresponding to 4 days after oocyte retrieval, investigating their psychosocial wellbeing related to the treatment defined as emotional reactions to the treatment, quality-of-life, infertility-related stress, and marital benefit. The questionnaire included items from the Copenhagen Multi-Centre Psychosocial Infertility (COMPI) Fertility Problem Stress Scales and the COMPI Marital Benefit Measure.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups for both women and men. In total, response rates were 90.7% for women and 90.2% for men. In the freeze-all group, 207 women and 179 men completed the questionnaire compared with 204 women and 178 men in the fresh transfer group. Men in the two treatment groups did not differ in any of the explored aspects of psychosocial wellbeing (i.e. emotional reactions to the treatment, quality-of-life, infertility-related stress, and marital benefit) 6 days after disclosure of treatment strategy. Women in the freeze-all group reported a slightly higher degree of depressive symptoms (P = 0.045) and mood swings (P = 0.001) (i.e. variables included in 'emotional reactions to treatment') compared to women in the fresh transfer group. When adjusted for multiple testing, depressive symptoms were no longer significantly different between the two groups. No additional differences in psychosocial wellbeing were found. Self-reported quality-of-life during treatment was also rated as similar between the two groups in both women and men, but was slightly lower than they would rate their quality-of-life when not in fertility treatment.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Although response rates were high, selection bias cannot be excluded. As this study was an RCT, we assume that psychosocial characteristics of the participants were equally distributed in the two groups, thus it is unlikely that the identified psychosocial differences between the freeze-all and fresh transfer group were present already at baseline. Furthermore, the questionnaire was completed as a one-time assessment 4 days after oocyte retrieval, thus not reflecting the whole treatment process, whereas an assessment after the full completed treatment cycle is needed to draw firm conclusions about the psychosocial consequences of the whole waiting period. However, a question posted that late would be highly biased on whether or not a pregnancy had been achieved.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The results indicate that individuals in the freeze-all group exhibited slightly higher levels of depressive symptoms and mood swings compared to those in the fresh transfer group. Nevertheless, it is important to note that any worries related to potential emotional strains stemming from delaying embryo transfer should not overshadow the adoption of a freeze-all approach in cases where it is clinically recommended. As long as patients are provided with comprehensive information about the treatment strategy before initiating the process, it is worth emphasising that other aspects of psychosocial wellbeing were comparable between the two groups.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S) The study is part of the Reprounion collaborative study, co-financed by the European Union, Interreg V oresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak.

Psychosomatic Rehabilitation Patients and the General Population During COVID-19: Online Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Study of Digital Trainings and Rehabilitation Effects,Not Multi User,"Keller, FM; Dahmen, A; Derksen, C; Kötting, L; Lippke, S",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has largely affected people's mental health and psychological well-being. Specifically, individuals with a pre-existing mental health disorder seem more impaired by lockdown measures posing as major stress factors. Medical rehabilitation treatment can help people cope with these stressors. The internet and digital apps provide a platform to contribute to regular treatment and to conduct research on this topic. Objective: Making use of internet-based assessments, this study investigated individuals from the general population and patients from medical, psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics. Levels of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, common COVID-19-related worries, and the intention to use digital apps were compared. Furthermore, we investigated whether participating in internet-delivered digital trainings prior to and during patients' rehabilitation stay, as well as the perceived usefulness of digital trainings, were associated with improved mental health after rehabilitation. Methods: A large-scale, online, cross-sectional study was conducted among a study sample taken from the general population (N=1812) in Germany from May 2020 to April 2021. Further, a longitudinal study was conducted making use of the internet among a second study sample of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients at two measurement time points-before (N=1719) and after (n=738) rehabilitation-between July 2020 and April 2021. Validated questionnaires and adapted items were used to assess mental health and COVID-19-related worries. Digital trainings were evaluated. Propensity score matching, multivariate analyses of covariance, an exploratory factor analysis, and hierarchical regression analyses were performed. Results: Patients from the psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics reported increased symptoms with regard to depression, anxiety, loneliness, and stress (F-4,F-2028=183.74, P<.001, eta(2)(p)=0.27) compared to the general population. Patients perceived greater satisfaction in communication with health care professionals (F-1,F-837=31.67, P<.001, eta(2)(p)=0.04), had lower financial worries (F-1,F-837=38.96, P<.001, eta(2)(p)=0.04), but had higher household-related worries (F-1,F-837=5.34, P=.02, eta(2)(p)=0.01) compared to the general population. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived stress were lower postrehabilitation (F-1,F-712=23.21, P<.001, eta(2)(p)=0.04) than prior to rehabilitation. Psychosomatic patients reported a higher intention to use common apps and digital trainings (F-3,F-2021=51.41, P<.001, eta(2)(p)=0.07) than the general population. With regard to digital trainings offered prior to and during the rehabilitation stay, the perceived usefulness of digital trainings on rehabilitation goals was associated with decreased symptoms of depression (beta=-.14, P<.001), anxiety (beta=-.12, P<.001), loneliness (beta=-.18, P<.001), and stress postrehabilitation (beta=-.19, P<.001). Participation in digital group therapy for depression was associated with an overall change in depression (F-1,F-725=4.82, P=.03, eta(2)(p)=0.01) and anxiety (F-1,F-725=6.22, P=.01, eta(2)(p)=0.01) from pre- to postrehabilitation. Conclusions: This study validated the increased mental health constraints of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients in comparison to the general population and the effects of rehabilitation treatment.

Evidence-based, cost-effective public mental health (PMH) interventions exist to prevent mental disorders from arising, prevent associated impacts of mental disorders (including through treatment), and promote mental wellbeing and resilience. However, only a small proportion of people with mental disorders receive minimally adequate treatment. Compared with treatment, there is even less coverage of interventions to prevent the associated impacts of mental disorders, prevent mental disorders from arising, or promote mental wellbeing and resilience. This implementation failure breaches the right to health, has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and results in preventable suffering, broad impacts, and associated economic costs. In this Health Policy paper, we outline specific actions to improve the coverage of PMH interventions, including PMH needs assessments, collaborative advocacy and leadership, PMH practice to inform policy and implementation, training and improvement of population literacy, settings-based and integrated approaches, use of digital technology, maximising existing resources, focus on high-return interventions, human rights approaches, legislation, and implementation research. Increased interest in PMH in populations and governments since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic supports these actions. Improved implementation of PMH interventions can result in broad health, social, and economic impacts, even in the short-term, which support the achievement of a range of policy objectives, sustainable economic development, and recovery.",NA,wos,Psychiatry,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/NA)
Qualitative evaluation of the acceptability and feasibility among healthcare professionals and patients of an ART multi-cycle treatment planning and continuation intervention prototype,Not Multi User,"Harrison, C; Gameiro, S; Boivin, J",HUMAN REPRODUCTION,2023,"STUDY QUESTION Is it possible to design an ART Treatment Planning and Continuation Intervention (TPCI) that is considered acceptable and feasible to patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs)? SUMMARY ANSWER HCPs and patients responded positively to the TPCI prototype and perceived it as an acceptable intervention to support patients to stay engaged with planned treatment, but some concerns were raised about the feasibility of using it in practice. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY People discontinue ART due to its psychological burden. Digital tools to support people undergoing ART are available but typically focus only on practical support rather than psychological support. Research about treatment continuation and multi-cycle planning indicates that cognitive factors (expectations, intentions, efficacy beliefs) should be targets of interventions designed to help patients engage with and continue treatment to meet their personal treatment plans and goals. However, it is not known whether this form of psychological support would be acceptable for HCPs and patients or feasible to implement in practice. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Qualitative cognitive interviews with HCPs and patients (May 2021). Patients were eligible if they had had a consultation to start a first/repeat stimulated IVF/ICSI cycle in the 8 weeks prior to recruitment, were aged 18 or older (upper age limit of 42 years for women) and fluent in English. Eligible HCPs were those employed by a fertility clinic who were responsible for delivering treatment planning consultations to patients. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS HCPs and patients were asked to think aloud while being exposed to and exploring the TPCI in one-to-one online cognitive interviews. The TPCI was designed to reduce treatment discontinuation via cognitive factors namely formation and maintenance of multi-cycle ART intentions and efficiency of decision-making during treatment, and continuation of treatment after an unsuccessful cycle (when recommended). To impact cognitive factors the TPCI comprised of two components: an expectation management and reasoning checklist for HCPs to use during planning consultations (TPCI Checklist) and a multi-feature cognitive support mobile application (TPCI App) for patients to use prior to and during treatment. After participants thought aloud while being exposed to the TPCI prototype (both components) they were asked open questions concerning their perceptions of the core components and activities on eight acceptability dimensions (e.g. acceptability, demand, integration). Interviews lasted between 40 and 90 min, were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Thirteen HCPs and 13 patients participated in 25 online interviews. Thematic analysis using inductive and deductive coding generated 180 codes, grouped into 22 categories and synthesized into 9 themes. The themes showed that HCPs and patients provided positive feedback about the TPCI, perceiving it as a needed, acceptable and potentially effective way to forewarn patients of the possible need for multiple cycles, to provide patients with a sense of patient-clinic collaboration and support, and to bolster treatment intentions, all of which were perceived to contribute to reduced treatment discontinuation. HCPs perceived implementation of the TPCI Checklist to be challenging in its current length due to time pressures and clinic workload. Suggestions for enhancing the TPCI Checklist and App were provided, but none required critical changes to its core components or activities. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION All patients were women recruited from social media websites, mainly associated with patient support groups, who may be highly committed to their fertility treatment. HCPs were predominantly from private fertility clinics. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The findings suggest there is demand for digital support geared towards motivational aspects of undergoing ART. The TPCI is an acceptable support tool to meet that need according to HCPs responsible for delivering planning consultations and patients undergoing fertility treatment. Future research is needed to develop the prototype and examine the feasibility of implementation of the TPCI in clinics.

Qualitative exploration of the psychological dimensions of telehealth shared medical appointments (SMAs) for buprenorphine prescribing,Good,"Greenberg, B; Oft, AC; Lucitt, L; Haug, NA; Lembke, A",JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES,2024,"Background: Shared medical appointments (SMAs) for buprenorphine prescribing are clinical encounters in which multiple patients with opioid problems receive treatment from providers in a group setting. Telehealth, the provision of clinical services remotely using telecommunications technology, is an essential modality for improving access to healthcare when combined with SMAs, especially since the COVID pandemic. Objectives: The current study specifically examined psychological components of telehealth SMAs for buprenorphine prescribing to learn about the benefits and drawbacks of this treatment model. Methods: Data was collected through qualitative interviews with patients (N=10) in a psychiatry addiction medicine clinic. Narrative synthesis using grounded theory was conducted to identify salient themes from the interviews. Results: Findings highlighted the advantages and downsides of telehealth SMA to treat addictive disorders in a digital age: (1) Shared group identity; (2) Decreased stigma around buprenorphine; (3) Benefits of telehealth; (4) Discomfort with group SMA format; (5) Strategies for managing medication side effects; and (6) Enhanced empathy for providers. Several themes corresponded to therapeutic factors identified in group therapy (i.e., installation of hope, universality, imparting information, altruism) and mechanisms theorized in previous SMA research (e.g., combating isolation, disease self-management, feeling inspired by others). Conclusion: Telehealth SMAs for buprenorphine prescribing may be a unique opportunity for patients to receive both ongoing medication management and psychosocial benefits that promote recovery and reduce stigma. The SMA group had shortcomings for some patients, including privacy concerns, fear of judgment from other patients and limited time to discuss individual concerns with providers.",10.1080/10550887.2022.2123669,"pubmed, wos",Substance Abuse,Buprenorphine; opioid use disorder; opioid dependence; shared medical appointments,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2022.2123669)

At home, patients have limited options to contact healthcare providers in the hospital in case of severe pain and nausea. A smartphone application for patients to self-record pain and nausea when at home after day care surgery might improve patient's recovery. Currently patient experiences with smartphone applications are promising; however, we do not know whether remote monitoring with such an application also improves the patient's recovery. This study aims to evaluate the experienced quality of recovery after day care surgery between patients provided with the smartphone application for remote monitoring and patients receiving standard care without remote monitoring.Methods This non-blinded randomized controlled trial with mixed methods design will include 310 adult patients scheduled for day care surgery.The intervention group receives the smartphone application with text message function for remote monitoring that enables patients to record pain and nausea. An anaesthesia professional trained in empathetic communication, who will contact the patient in case of severe pain or nausea, performs daily monitoring. The control group receives standard care, with post-discharge verbal and paper instructions.The main study endpoint is the difference in perceived quality of recovery, measured with the QoR-15 questionnaire on the 7th day after day care surgery. Secondary endpoints are the overall score on the Quality of Recovery-15 at day 1, 4 and 7-post discharge, the perceived quality of hospital aftercare and experienced psychological effects of remote monitoring during postoperative recovery from day care surgery.Discussion This study will investigate if facilitating patients and healthcare professionals with a tool for accessible and empathetic communication might lead to an improved quality of the postoperative recovery period.",10.1186/s13063-023-07121-6,"pubmed, wos",Research & Experimental Medicine,Day care surgery; Postoperative pain; Postoperative nausea; Postoperative recovery; Remote monitoring; eHealth; Smartphone application; Randomized controlled trial,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-023-07121-6)
RECOVER-E - a mobile app for patients undergoing total knee or hip replacement: study protocol,Not Multi User,"Stauber, A; Schüssler, N; Palmdorf, S; Schürholz, N; Bruns, D; Osterbrink, J; Nestler, N",BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS,2020,"Background Total knee replacement (TKR) or total hip replacement (THR) are common and effective procedures in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) to restore physical function and reduce joint related pain. Patient education plays an important role in the treatment process aiming to develop necessary self-management skills to facilitate recovery and ensure long-term success. We have developed a mobile app (RECOVER-E) for iOS and Android smartphones which provides important information on the preoperative phase, surgery and recovery. The concomitant study will determine the efficacy of RECOVER-E on patients' surgical outcomes. Methods/design This study is a non-randomized, multi-centre (4 sites), double-arm, controlled trial with 1:1 assignment. 160 patients undergoing primary TKR or THR will be recruited from January until October 2019 in 4 German hospitals. Both groups will receive standard care. Additionally, the intervention group will use the app RECOVER-E. Measurements will be taken 4-6 weeks before surgery, on the day of admission to the hospital, on the first and 7th postoperative day and 3 months post-surgery. Primary outcome will be self-reported physical function measured on the activities of daily living (ADL) subscale of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) for patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis, respectively. Secondary outcomes include the subscales for pain, symptoms, function in sport and recreation and knee/hip-related quality of life of the HOOS and KOOS, preoperative anxiety, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), as well as, pain at rest and pain during activity measured by a numerical rating scale (NRS). Primary endpoint is 3 months post-surgery. Discussion Mobile Health (mHealth) has become increasingly important in patient-centred health care aiming to enhance patient involvement and self-management capabilities.

Some need them to prevent relapse, but 30-50% could possibly stop them without relapsing and avoid adverse effects and complications of long-term use. However, stopping is not always easy due to withdrawal symptoms and a fear of relapse of depression. When general practitioners review patients on long-term antidepressants and recommend to those who are suitable to stop the medication, only 6-8% are able to stop. The Reviewing long-term antidepressant use by careful monitoring in everyday practice (REDUCE) research programme aims to identify safe and cost-effective ways of helping patients taking long-term antidepressants taper off treatment when appropriate. Methods Design: REDUCE is a two-arm, 1:1 parallel group randomised controlled trial, with randomisation clustered by participating family practices. Setting: England and north Wales. Population: patients taking antidepressants for longer than 1 year for a first episode of depression or longer than 2 years for repeated episodes of depression who are no longer depressed and want to try to taper off their antidepressant use. Intervention: provision of 'ADvisor' internet programmes to general practitioners or nurse practitioners and to patients designed to support antidepressant withdrawal, plus three patient telephone calls from a psychological wellbeing practitioner. The control arm receives usual care. Blinding of patients, practitioners and researchers is not possible in an open pragmatic trial, but statistical and health economic data analysts will remain blind to allocation. Outcome measures: the primary outcome is self-reported nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire at 6 months for depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes: depressive symptoms at other follow-up time points, anxiety, discontinuation of antidepressants, social functioning, wellbeing, enablement, quality of life, satisfaction, and use of health services for costs. Sample size: 402 patients (201 intervention and 201 controls) from 134 general practices recruited over 15-18 months, and followed-up at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. A qualitative process evaluation will be conducted through interviews with 15-20 patients and 15-20 practitioners in each arm to explore why the interventions were effective or not, depending on the results. Discussion Helping patients reduce and stop antidepressants is often challenging for practitioners and time-consuming for very busy primary care practices. If REDUCE provides evidence showing that access to internet and telephone support enables more patients to stop treatment without increasing depression we will try to implement the intervention throughout the National Health Service, publishing practical guidance for professionals and advice for patients to follow, publicised through patient support groups.",10.1186/s13063-020-04338-7,"pubmed, wos",Research & Experimental Medicine,Depression; Antidepressants; Discontinuation; Withdrawal; Deprescribing; Primary care; Digital intervention,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-020-04338-7)

RETRACTED: Mitigating Psychological Trauma on Adult Burn Patients Based on Virtual Reality Technology of Smart Medical Treatment (Retracted Article),Other,"Ren, HL; Du, YP; Feng, XF; Pu, JM; Xiang, XY",JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING,2021,"Virtual reality (VR) is one of the hot spots in the computer network world in recent years, which has attracted more and more people's attention. This study mainly explores the effect of mitigating the psychological trauma of adult burn patients based on the VR technology of smart medical treatment. First, the EEG data are sent to the data processing module through a wireless protocol; then, the data processing module denoises the EEG data and performs feature extraction and feedback parameter calculation; after that, these parameters will be sent to the VR interaction engine; based on this, these parameters change the VR scene to capture and reflect the physiological activities of the patient's brain in real time; finally, the patient uses the VR scene content presented by the real-time feedback of the captured EEG signal as a guide to making self-adjustment in time, and the electrical signal of captured brain at this time is again transmitted to the next work cycle and continues to feed back and present new VR interactive scenes to guide and intervene in the patient's self-regulation behavior. The VR feedback training module is responsible for receiving the characteristic data calculated from the EEG acquisition and processing module and converts it into parameter variables that control the VR intervention system. The system user adjusts the state according to the feedback information displayed in the VR scene and generates new EEG signals to promote the realization of self-adjustment. The biofeedback training based on EEG feeds back the intuitive EEG state to the patient, prompting them to learn how to realize self-regulation and achieve the purpose of adjusting the level of mental health. The degree of itching and pain in the VR treatment group was alleviated, and compared with the normal training treatment results, it was statistically significant (P>0.05).

Randomized Controlled Lifestyle Intervention (LION) Study for Weight Loss and Maintenance in Adults With Obesity-Design and Methods,Not mental health,"Reik, A; Holzapfel, C",FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION,2020,"Introduction: Due to the increasing prevalence of obesity, approaches for a more effective treatment especially in the long-term perspective are needed. However, studies on weight loss and maintenance show heterogeneous results with large inter-individual variations. Therefore, it is of interest to identify factors that contribute to inter-individual differences and predict the success of long-term weight management. Methods and Analysis: The primary outcome of the Lifestyle Intervention (LION) Study is to evaluate the effect of two diets (low carb vs. low fat) and two digital counseling tools (newsletter vs. mobile application) on weight maintenance 12 months after weight loss. The identification of predictive factors (e.g., genetic, epigenetic, physiological, psychological) for the success of weight loss and maintenance is a secondary outcome. Men and women with a body mass index (BMI) between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m(2), aged 18-65 years, and without severe diseases are considered eligible. After phenotyping (e.g., anthropometry, resting metabolic rate, meal challenges, blood parameters) participants will follow a formula-based, low-calorie diet (LCD) for 8 weeks. In addition, the intake of 200 g raw or cooked non-starchy vegetables are allowed per day. Subsequently, 252 participants will be randomized into one of the four intervention groups (low carb/app, low carb/newsletter, low fat/app, low fat/newsletter) for the 12-month weight maintenance step. The study will be concluded after another 12 months of follow-up. Results should provide indications for successful weight management and give insights into the personalized treatment of obesity.

Randomized Controlled Trial to Test the Efficacy of an Unguided Online Intervention with Automated Feedback for the Treatment of Insomnia,Not Multi User,"Lorenz, N; Heim, E; Roetger, A; Birrer, E; Maercker, A",BEHAVIOURAL AND COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY,2019,"Background: Insomnia has become a major public health concern. Aims: The study examined the efficacy of a web-based unguided self-help programme with automated feedback. The programme was based on cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). The investigation particularly focused on factors that contribute to the maintenance of insomnia and tested whether treatment effects were stable over a period of 12 months. Method: Fifty-six participants were randomly assigned either to web-based CBT-I or to the waiting-list control group. Included measures assessed insomnia severity, sleep-related cognitions, safety behaviours, depression, anxiety and somatization. In the intervention group, a sleep diary was used to assess sleep continuity parameters, sleep quality and daytime performance. Results: Large between- and within-group effect sizes (d = 1.79, d = 1.59) for insomnia severity were found. The treatment group effect remained stable over the period of 12 months. Further, sleep-related cognitions, safety behaviours, depression and somatization significantly decreased in the treatment group compared with the control group. On all sleep diary parameters, medium to large effects were revealed within the treatment group. Anxiety did not decrease significantly from pre- to post-assessment. For all measures except somatization and anxiety significant within-group effects were found at 12-month follow-up assessment indicating long-lasting effects. Conclusions: This study adds evidence to the literature on unguided online interventions for insomnia, and indicates that online CBT-I can have substantial long-term effects on relevant sleep-related outcome parameters.

Our Mindfulness-Based Art Workshops (MBAW) combine two established, formal interventions: (a) Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, an 8-week group series teaching mindfulness practices, shown to reduce self-reported measures of stress, and (b) art therapy, the use of art exercises guided by certified therapists, shown to reduce stress and anxiety in hospitalized patients and students. The goal of our study was to determine if a peer-led, virtual workshop series designed specifically for and by medical students may be a feasible and effective method of adapting these models to improve student well-being. We hypothesized that virtual, medical student led MBAW are effective in reducing measures of stress, anxiety, and depression in medical students and improving well-being scores. In 2020, 24 University of Maryland School of Medicine first- and second-year medical students were randomized to either the MBAW or no-intervention control group. Primary outcomes included (a) short-term change in State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores and (b) difference in the perceived stress scores between intervention and control group immediately after, and 2, 4, and 6 weeks after a 6-session intervention. At specific time points, participants completed questionnaires, which included STAI and National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Perceived Stress survey. We compared the percentage of intervention participants who had clinically significant anxiety before and after MBAW for each session using a generalized estimating equations methodology and compared change from baseline scores between intervention and control groups using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures analysis. In the intervention group, post-MBAW STAI scores decreased by 16.2 (p = .0001), 5 (p = .1544), 13.7 (p = .0002), 13.6 (p = .0006), 12.1 (p = .0009), and 11.9 (p = .0011) points after sessions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Intervention group perceived stress scores decreased from baseline by 5.9 (p = .07) and 4.7 (p = .09) points more than the control group immediately after, and 2 weeks after the 6-session intervention. MBAW sessions are effective at significantly reducing short-term anxiety, and a 6-session MBAW workshop intervention shows trends toward decreasing levels of perceived stress lasting 2 weeks following the intervention, although these findings were not statistically significant.

CBT is an established form of psychological treatment that endeavors to identify and change unhelpful thinking patterns. The primary study end point was treatment group difference in mean HbA(1c) change from baseline to 90 days. RESULTS Among 669 randomly assigned subjects who completed app onboarding, the mean age was 58 years, BMI 35 kg/m(2), 54% were female, 28% Black, and 16% Latino. Baseline HbA(1c) was 8.2 and 8.1% in the BT-001 and control groups, respectively. After 90 days of app access, change in HbA(1c) was -0.28% (95% CI -0.41, -0.15) in the BT-001 group and +0.11% (95% CI -0.02, 0.23) in the control group (treatment group difference 0.39%; P < 0.0001). HbA(1c) reduction paralleled exposure to the therapeutic intervention, assessed as the number of modules completed on the app (P for trend <0.0001). No adverse events in either group were attributed to app use and no adverse device effects reported. CONCLUSIONS Patients randomly assigned to the BT-001 arm relative to the control arm had significantly lower HbA(1c) at 90 days. The digital therapeutic may provide a scalable treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes.",10.2337/dc22-1099,"pubmed, wos",Endocrinology & Metabolism,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2337/dc22-1099)
"Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Fluoxetine for-acute treatment of minor depressive disorder",Not Digital,"Judd, LL; Rapaport, MH; Yonkers, KA; Rush, AJ; Frank, E; Thase, ME; Kupfer, DJ; Plewes, JM; Schettler, PJ; Tollefson, G",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY,2004,"Objective: Minor depressive disorder is both common and associated with significant psychosocial impairment. This study examined antidepressant treatment efficacy in a large group of patients with minor depressive disorder. Method: One hundred sixty-two patients with minor depressive disorder were randomly assigned to receive fluoxetine or placebo in a 12-week, double-blind study; 73% (59 of 81) of the patients in each treatment group completed the study. Patients were evaluated weekly with standard depression rating instruments and measures of psychosocial impairment. Hypotheses were tested by last-observation-carried-forward analysis of variance (ANOVA) and confirmed by mixed (random-effects) regression analysis. Results: At baseline, minor depressive disorder patients were mildly to moderately depressed, with a corresponding degree of functional impairment. Over 12 weeks of treatment, both ANOVA and mixed regression showed fluoxetine to be superior to placebo as indicated by significantly greater improvement of fluoxetine-treated patients in scores on the 30-item clinician-rated Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, the 17-item and 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Clinical Global impression severity scale. Improvement in Global Assessment of Functioning Scale score was significantly greater for the fluoxetine group in mixed regression analysis only. Patients in both treatment groups reported a similar number and severity of adverse events during the 12-week treatment period. Conclusions: Clinicians frequently encounter minor depressive disorder either as a prodromal or residual phase of illness in major depressive disorder or as de novo minor depressive disorder episodes. Fluoxetine is significantly superior to placebo in reducing minor depressive disorder symptoms within a 12-week period.

Rapid Mobilization of an Evidence-Based Psychological Intervention for Pediatric Pain during COVID-19: The Development and Deployment of the Comfort Ability® Program Virtual Intervention (CAP-V),Not mental health,"Hale, AE; Bujoreanu, S; LaVigne, TW; Coakley, R",CHILDREN-BASEL,2023,"Background: The gold standard of treatment for chronic pain is a multidisciplinary approach in which psychology plays a leading role, but many children and caregivers do not gain access to this treatment. The Comfort Ability (R) Program (CAP) developed a CBT-oriented group intervention for adolescents and caregivers designed expressly to address access to evidence-based psychological care for pediatric chronic pain. Before the COVID-19 disruption of in-person services, the CAP workshop had been disseminated to a network of 21 children's hospitals across three countries. In March 2020, a virtual (telehealth) format was needed to ensure that children with chronic pain could continue to access this clinical service throughout the CAP Network. Methods: A model of knowledge mobilization was used to adapt the CAP workshop to a virtual format (CAP-V) and disseminate it to network sites. A pilot study assessing participant and clinician perceptions of acceptability, feasibility, and treatment satisfaction included baseline, post-sessions, and post-program questionnaires. Results: A knowledge mobilization framework informed the rapid development, refinement, and mobilization of CAP-V. Data from a pilot study demonstrated feasibility and high acceptability across participants and clinicians. Conclusions: A knowledge mobilizationframework provided a roadmap to successfully develop and deploy a virtual behavioral health intervention for adolescents with chronic pain and their caregivers during a worldwide pandemic.

We describe the rapid deployment of remotely delivered mind-body services to people with cancer during COVID-19, rates of participation, and acceptability from patients' perspectives. Methods Eligible participants were patients with cancer age >= 18 years enrolled in a single academic cancer center's online patient portal. Interventions included mind-body group therapy sessions in fitness, meditation, yoga, dance, tai chi, and music delivered using Zoom video conferencing. Sessions were 30-45 min and led by an integrative medicine clinician. Following each session, participants were asked to complete a three-item questionnaire assessing (1) satisfaction with the class session, (2) reduction in stress/anxiety, and (3) likelihood of recommending the class to others. Patients could also provide comments in real-time using the Zoom chat function. Results Among 5948 unique visits, the most frequently attended classes were fitness (n= 2513, 42.2%) followed by meditation (n= 1176, 19.8%) and yoga (n= 909, 15.3%). Of these visits, 3902 (65.6%) had an associated completed questionnaire.

One such shift was to convert group-level intensive outpatient psychiatric (IOP) interventions to telehealth. Historically, telehealth in psychiatric care has been studied in provider-patient interactions, but has not been as well studied for group telehealth service delivery. During the COVID-19 outbreak, providing group-based interventions was important in order to care for high-risk individuals who needed structured psychotherapy group support. However, the delivery of services via telehealth led to special challenges that were unable to be fully accommodated by the preexisting telehealth infrastructure. Rapid feasibility testing and adoption of technology was needed to support IOP services to minimize infectious spread while delivering group services to high-risk psychiatric patients. This article describes the processes and workflows for service delivery and early results of telehealth for IOP services in 2 adolescent treatment programs.

Rates of Trauma Exposure and Posttraumatic Stress in a Pediatric Digital Mental Health Intervention: Retrospective Analysis of Associations With Anxiety and Depressive Symptom Improvement Over Time,Other,"Lawrence-Sidebottom, D; Huffman, LG; Beam, AB; Guerra, R; Parikh, A; Roots, M; Huberty, J",JMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING,2024,"Background: More than 2 out of 3 children and adolescents in the United States experience trauma by the age of 16 years. Exposure to trauma in early life is linked to a range of negative mental health outcomes throughout the lifespan, particularly co-occurring symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS), anxiety, and depression. There has been an increasing uptake of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) among youths, particularly for anxiety and depression. However, little is known regarding the incidence of trauma exposure and PTS symptoms among youths participating in DMHIs and whether PTS symptoms impact anxiety and depressive symptom treatment response. Moreover, it is unclear whether participation in a DMHI for anxiety and depressive symptoms is associated with secondary effects on PTS symptoms among trauma-exposed youths. Objective: This study aims to use retrospective data from youths participating in a DMHI to (1) characterize rates of trauma, PTS, and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms; (2) determine whether trauma exposure and elevated PTS symptoms impact the improvement of comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms throughout participation in care; and (3) determine whether participation in a non-posttraumatic DMHI is linked to reductions in PTS symptoms. Methods: This study was conducted using retrospective data from members (children ages 6 to 12 years) involved in a pediatric collaborative care DMHI. Participating caregivers reported their children's trauma exposure. PTS, anxiety, and depressive symptom severity were measured monthly using validated assessments. Results: Among eligible participants (n=966), 30.2% (n=292) reported at least 1 traumatic event. Of those with trauma exposure and elevated symptoms of PTS (n=119), 73% (n=87) exhibited elevated anxiety symptoms and 50% (n=59) exhibited elevated depressive symptoms. Compared to children with no trauma, children with elevated PTS symptoms showed smaller reductions per month in anxiety but not depressive symptoms (anxiety: F-2,F-287=26.11; P<.001). PTS symptoms also decreased significantly throughout care, with 96% (n=79) of participants showing symptom reductions. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for the frequency of trauma exposure and comorbid psychiatric symptoms, as well as variations in treatment response between trauma-exposed and nontrauma-exposed youths, among participants in a pediatric collaborative care DMHI. Youths with traumatic experiences may show increased psychiatric comorbidities and slower treatment responses than their peers with no history of trauma. These findings deliver compelling evidence that collaborative care DMHIs may be well-suited to address mental health symptoms in children with a history of trauma while also highlighting the critical need to assess symptoms of PTS in children seeking treatment.",10.2196/55560,"pubmed, wos",Pediatrics,collaborative care model; telehealth; childhood trauma; DMHI; digital health; mental health; telemedicine; trauma; traumatic; pediatric; pediatrics; paediatric; paediatrics; child; children; youth; adolescent; adolescents; teen; teens; teenager; teenagers; retrospective; anxiety; depression; depressive; co-occurring; comorbid; comorbidity; comorbidities; association; associations; correlation; correlations; correlate,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/55560)
Receiving aphasia intervention in a virtual environment: the participants' perspective,Good,"Amaya, A; Woolf, C; Devane, N; Galliers, J; Talbot, R; Wilson, S; Marshall, J",APHASIOLOGY,2018,"Background: Digital technology is making an increasing contribution to aphasia therapy. However, applications of virtual reality are rare. EVA Park is a virtual island developed with and for people with aphasia. It is a multi-user environment, which enables people with aphasia to interact with support workers, therapists and each other. The first study to use EVA Park in aphasia rehabilitation demonstrated significant gains in functional communication. This article augments the findings of that study, by reporting results from qualitative interviews conducted with the 20 study participants.Aims: This study aimed to determine the views of participants about the intervention that they received in EVA Park, and the impacts of that intervention. Long-term retrospective views were also explored.Methods & Procedures: Participants took part in 1:1, semi-structured interviews two weeks before (entry) and two weeks after (exit) the intervention. Questions focussed on activities undertaken by participants, communication, changes since the stroke and uses of technology. Exit interviews additionally explored participants' views and experiences of EVA Park and any perceived impacts of the intervention. A subset of five participants was interviewed at least one year later, to explore long-term recollections of the EVA Park intervention and any perceived long-term impacts. Interview data were transcribed and subject to framework analysis.Outcomes & Results: The thematic framework comprised 10 parent themes and 33 sub-themes. Following affect, the largest single theme related to EVA Park, with 636 coded references. Comments were overwhelmingly positive. EVA Park intervention was strongly associated with fun and enjoyment. Participants particularly valued their relationship with the support workers who delivered the intervention. The virtual locations and activities in EVA Park were also appreciated, together with the contact with other participants. Perceived impacts related to communication, activity, computer use and confidence. Most (4) participants in the long-term interviews described maintained impacts.Conclusions: These interview results indicate that the first intervention delivered in EVA Park was highly acceptable to participants and perceived as beneficial. They augment the findings of our experimental study and suggest that EVA Park could be a valuable addition to the resources available to practising clinicians.",10.1080/02687038.2018.1431831,wos,Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology; Linguistics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Rehabilitation,Aphasia; therapy; participant perspectives; virtual reality,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/02687038.2018.1431831)

Recent developments in research and treatment for social phobia (social anxiety disorder),Not Multi User,"Cottraux, J",CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHIATRY,2005,"Purpose of review This review covers three themes of research that brought fresh data useful for clinical practice in a handicapping anxiety disorder: social phobia. Recent findings deriving from basic biological research, new forms of psychological therapies, and recent psychopharmacology controlled trials are reviewed. Recent findings The basic neuroimaging research suggests that greater activation of the amygdala to novel versus familiar faces may be an underlying trait marker for social phobia. Social phobia may represent a phenotype that expresses a genetically driven trait of social withdrawal, which may be related to infantile inhibited temperament (Kagan's syndrome). The development of virtual reality therapy as therapeutic tool for social phobia appeared promising in one controlled, but not randomized, study. A controlled study suggests that social phobias in children can be effectively treated with cognitive behavioural therapy. This represents an extension of the work done with adults. Venlafaxine appears an effective short-term treatment for social anxiety disorder in two controlled studies, A new compound, pregabalin, appeared clearly effective in a positive controlled study. This trial marks the advent of a new pharmacological lineage for social phobia. Both venlafaxine and pregabalin, however, have been studied in short-term studies. Longer follow-up and relapse prevention studies are warranted. Summary Neuroimaging research points to a temperamental basis for social phobia. Virtual reality therapy is an emerging tool to carry out exposure treatment. Group cognitive behavioural therapy can be extended successfully to children. Venlafaxine and pregabalin have a proven short-term effectiveness in social phobia.",NA,wos,Psychiatry,antidepressant drugs; cognitive behaviour therapy; social anxiety disorder; social phobia; virtual reality therapy,URI::(https://www.doi.org/NA)
"Recruitment, adherence and attrition challenges in internet-based indicated prevention programs for eating disorders: lessons learned from a randomised controlled trial of ProYouth OZ",Good,"Ali, K; Fassnacht, DB; Farrer, LM; Rieger, E; Moessner, M; Bauer, S; Griffiths, KM",JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS,2022,"Background: Growing evidence supports the effectiveness of Internet-based prevention programs for eating disorders, but the adjunctive benefit of synchronous peer support has yet to be investigated. In the current study, a randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of an indicated Internet-based prevention program (ProYouth OZ) with and without peer-to-peer support in reducing disordered eating behaviours and attitudes. Method: Fifty young adults (18-25 years) with eating disorder symptoms were randomised to one of three study conditions: (1) ProYouth OZ (without peer-to-peer support), (2) ProYouth OZ Peers (with peer-to-peer support), and (3) a waitlist control group. Outcomes were assessed at three different time points. Eating disorder symptoms (primary outcome) were measured with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire. Results: Of 415 screened participants, 73 (17.6%) were eligible and 213 (51.3%) excluded due to severe eating disorder symptoms. Fifteen participants (30%) completed the post-intervention survey. Of the two intervention groups, 20.6% failed to access any component of the program. Of 17 ProYouth OZ Peers participants, 58.8% attended at least one chat session, 20% attended 2-5 sessions, and 11.8% attended all six sessions. Due to limited outcome data, it was not possible to statistically examine between-group differences in outcomes. Visual inspection of individual profiles revealed that both ProYouth OZ Peers participants who completed the post-intervention survey showed a decrease in disordered eating compared with only one of the six completers in ProYouth OZ. Conclusion: Findings highlight the challenges of trialling Internet-based eating disorder prevention programs in the community. The study identified a large group of emerging adults with eating disorders who were interested in an Internet-based program, suggesting a high level of unmet need. Future research on synchronous peer-to-peer support in Internet-based prevention for eating disorders is warranted. Further studies are required to identify optimal strategies for reaching this population (e.g., online vs. offline) and evaluating the effectiveness of a range of strategies for promoting engagement. Finally, there is an urgent need to develop innovative widely accessible interventions for individuals who experience clinically relevant eating disorder symptomatology but may not be ready or able to seek professional face-to-face treatment.",10.1186/s40337-021-00520-7,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Psychiatry,Online intervention; Peer support; Mental health; Barriers; Stigma; Eating disorder literacy; Help-seeking; Body image; Digital health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00520-7)

Digital interventions have shown small positive effects in contributing to reductions in problematic use. Specific research on smartphone apps is sparse and the few studies published indicate effects ranging from negative or null to small or moderate. TeleCoach (TM), a web-based skills training smartphone app, has shown positive effects in non-treatment-seeking university students with excessive drinking. This pilot trial aimed to evaluate app effects in a sample of internet help-seekers from the general population in Sweden. A total of 89 participants were recruitedviaonline advertisement. Following baseline assessment for hazardous use, they were randomized to TeleCoach or a web-based control app offering brief information and advice regarding problematic alcohol use. The primary outcome was number of standard drinks per week; secondary outcomes included drinking quantity and frequency, binge drinking and blood alcohol count measures as well as app user data and comorbidity related to depression, anxiety, and drug use. Analysis of baseline and 6-week follow-up outcomes showed significant within-group effects on alcohol consumption but no significant between-group differences.

Reducing alexithymia and increasing interoceptive awareness: A randomized controlled trial comparing mindfulness with dyadic socio-emotional app-based practice,Good,"Silveira, S; Godara, M; Faschinger, A; Singer, T",JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,2023,"Background: Emotion processing deficits of alexithymia are a transdiagnostic risk factor. While such deficits are malleable, the differential efficacy of brief scalable digital mental trainings remains understudied. Methods: This randomized controlled trial probed the efficacy of mindfulness-based (MB) and partner-based socio-emotional Affect Dyad (SE) practice, both supported by weekly coaching sessions, in reducing alexithymia in 285 adult participants. We investigated the predictive role of interoceptive awareness assessed a) before and after daily practice, b) in ecological momentary assessment (EMA) before and after the intervention, and c) weekly during the 10-week intervention. Results: Both interventions reduced emotion processing difficulties on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Similarly, both interventions improved interoceptive awareness immediately after daily practice and after the intervention period, yet SE outperformed MB training in EMA assessments. Further, only Dyad practice led to increases in body listening and self-regulatory aspects of the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) over time, with the latter explaining a decrease in alexithymia. Limitations: Given the subclinical study sample, findings are limited in their generalizability to clinical samples. Conclusions: Findings suggest that app-based socio-emotional and mindfulness-based practices, supported by online coaching sessions, are effective in reducing emotion processing deficits. Dyad training showed advantages on some measures of body awareness, which predicted observed changes in alexithymia.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Provider Education Program (NAMI PEP) when implemented as a curricular requirement across two cohorts of third-year osteopathic medical students, comparing traditional, passive learning and active, online delivery formats. Materials and Methods Participants were two cohorts of third-year medical students (Cohort 1 n = 186; Cohort 2 n = 139; overall N = 325) who completed questionnaires measuring affect, beliefs, and behaviors toward patients with mental illness at pre-program, 1-week follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. For Cohort 1, the existing community-based NAMI PEP was implemented. For Cohort 2, the program was adapted to an online, active learning format tailored to medical students, and an additional 3-month follow-up assessment was added to better identify intermediate-term effects. Results The NAMI PEP was associated with longitudinal improvements in target outcomes, with enhanced effects with the adapted curriculum in Cohort 2.

A virtual reality (VR)-based restorative environment has shown to be an effective new technique to reduce stress and improve cognitive performance, but little is known about its mechanism of improving neuronal activity and connectivity. Methods This is a randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial. A total of 140 medical staff will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either the VR immersion group (intervention group) or the control group. In the morning after the night shift, the participants in the intervention group will watch 360 degrees panoramic videos of immersive VR natural restorative environments for 10 min, while the participants in the control group will just rest for 10 min. Assessments of abbreviated Profile of Mood States Questionnaire (POMS) and verbal fluency task (VFT) performances, as well as oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) and total hemoglobin concentration acquired by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be performed at baseline (day work), the morning after night shift but before the intervention (previous) and after intervention (post). Data collected after a night shift will be compared to baseline performance as well as between the two groups. Discussion This trial will investigate the effects of the night shift and VR-based restorative environment intervention on mood, cognitive performance, and neuronal activity and connectivity.

A subset of MMAs are aimed at helping consumers identify mental states and/or mental illnesses. Although this is a fledgling domain, there are already enough extant mental health MMAs both to suggest a typology and to detail some of the regulatory issues they pose. As to the former, the current generation of apps includes those that facilitate self-assessment or self-help, connect patients with online support groups, connect patients with therapists, or predict mental health issues. Regulatory concerns with these apps include their quality, safety, and data protection. Unfortunately, the regulatory frameworks that apply have failed to provide coherent risk-assessment models.

Rehabilitation efficacy comparison of virtual reality technology and computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment: A network meta-analysis,Other,"Xiao, ZH; Wang, ZN; Ge, S; Zhong, Y; Zhang, WM",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE,2022,"Objective: Virtual reality (VR) and computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR) are two emerging rehabilitation therapies for stroke patients. The aim of this study was to compare the rehabilitation efficacy of these two treatments for patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Methods: A network search of Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, VIP, WanFang Data, and CNKI databases was performed from their inception to February 2022 for screening randomized controlled trials related to VR and CACR in the treatment of PSCI. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk bias assessment tool. The primary outcomes of the included studies contained at least one of the following clinical outcome measures: Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). After screening the literature, assessing the quality and extracting the data, a network meta-analysis was performed with STATA software. Results: A total of 21 randomized controlled trials were included, including 1,047 patients. The results of network meta-analysis showed that under MMSE index, VR group (p = 0.067) and CACR group (p = 0.054) tended to be superior to CT group, but it was not significant. Both the VR (p = 0.024) and CACR (p < 0.001) groups had significantly better outcomes compared to the conventional therapy group in terms of MoCA.

Rehearsal-based digital serious boardgame versus a game-free e-learning tool for anatomical education: Quasi-randomized controlled trial,Not mental health,"Tan, JW; Chong, DKS; Ng, KB; Car, LT; Mogali, SR",ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,2023,"Serious games may resolve problems relating to low motivation in complex medical topics such as anatomy. However, they remain relatively novel introductions to the science of learning, and further research is required to ascertain their benefits. This study describes the overall development and testing of a digital serious boardgame designed to facilitate the rehearsal of musculoskeletal anatomy based on self-determination theory with considerations for the psychological state of Flow. It was hypothesized that students assigned to the intervention game condition would attain higher Flow scores, a measure of engagement and intrinsic motivation, than students assigned to the game-free control, and that the intervention condition would report either superior or non-superior, but not inferior, scores on a surprise recall test. A total of 36 second-year undergraduate medical students participated in the quasi-randomized controlled trial, where the intervention groups went first and randomly drew questions that were mirrored into the control groups. All students were administered an identical 10-question baseline assessment before their interventions, the Short Flow Scale immediately after, and a surprise test four-to-six weeks later. Independent samples t-tests indicated that students of both conditions were of similar baseline knowledge (t = 0.7, p = 0.47), significantly higher Flow scores in the game condition (t = 2.99, p = 0.01), and no significant differences between surprise test scores (t = -0.3, p = 0.75).

Relationship Between Patient Engagement and Depressive Symptoms Among People Living With HIV in a Mobile Health Intervention: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Zeng, Y; Guo, Y; Li, LH; Hong, YA; Li, YR; Zhu, MT; Zeng, CB; Zhang, HX; Cai, WP; Liu, C; Wu, SM; Chi, PL; Monroe-Wise, A; Hao, YT; Ho, RTH",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2020,"Background: Associations between higher levels of patient engagement and better health outcomes have been found in face-to-face interventions; studies on such associations with mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been limited and the results are inconclusive. Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between patient engagement in an mHealth intervention and depressive symptoms using repeated measures of both patient engagement and patient outcomes at 4 time points. Methods: Data were drawn from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an mHealth intervention aimed at reducing depressive symptoms among people living with HIV and elevated depressive symptoms. We examined the association between patient engagement and depressive symptoms in the intervention group (n=150) where participants received an adapted cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) course and physical activity promotion on their WeChat social media app. Depressive symptoms were repeatedly measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at baseline and 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. Patient engagement was correspondingly measured by the completion rate, frequency of items completed, and time spent on the program at 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. Latent growth curve models (LGCMs) were used to explore the relationship between patient engagement and depressive symptoms at multiple time points in the intervention. Results: The mean PHQ-9 scores were 10.2 (SD 4.5), 7.7 (SD 4.8), 6.5 (SD 4.7), and 6.7 (SD 4.1) at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months, respectively. The mean completion rates were 50.6% (SD 31.8%), 51.5% (SD 32.2%), and 50.8% (SD 33.7%) at 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively; the average frequencies of items completed were 18.0 (SD 14.6), 32.6 (SD 24.8), and 47.5 (SD 37.2) at 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively, and the mean times spent on the program were 32.7 (SD 66.7), 65.4 (SD 120.8), and 96.4 (SD 180.4) minutes at 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively. LGCMs showed good model fit and indicated that a higher completion rate (beta at 3 months=-2.184, P=.048) and a greater frequency of items completed (beta at 3 months=-0.018, P=.04) were associated with fewer depressive symptoms at 3 months. Although not significant, similar trends were found in the abovementioned relationships at 1 and 2 months. There was no significant relationship between time spent on the program and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: This study revealed a positive association between patient engagement and health outcomes at 3 months of an mHealth intervention using LGCMs and repeated measures data.

Remote Delivery of the Cuidándome Telehealth Intervention for Self-Management of Depression and Anxiety Among Latina Immigrant Women: Randomized Controlled Trial,Population,"Alvarez, C; Aryal, S; Vrany, E; Sanchez, RMJ; Quiles, R; Escobar-Acosta, L; Hill-Briggs, F",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2024,"Background: Growing evidence suggests that Latina immigrant survivors of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are at increased risk for developing and remaining with either depression or anxiety or both symptoms. This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a telehealth intervention-Cuidandome (quee-DAN-doh-meh, taking care of myself). Cuidandome is a 10-week, patient-centered, trauma-informed intervention delivered by a trained facilitator that promotes self-management of depression and anxiety symptoms through improved problem-solving skills and strategies.Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of Cuidandome delivered remotely (via Zoom) with Latina immigrant ACE survivors with either depression or anxiety or both symptoms. We also estimated the effect sizes associated with the intervention on decreasing depression and anxiety symptoms and improving social problem-solving styles.Methods: We evaluated Cuidandome using a randomized controlled trial design. Latina immigrants (N=47) who had experienced at least 1 ACE and had at least mild depression or anxiety symptoms were randomized to Cuidandome or a comparison group delivered by trained facilitators. We assessed for changes in depression and anxiety symptoms as well as social problem-solving styles at baseline, post intervention, and 3-and 6-month follow-up.Results: Analyses indicated significant decreases over time within both Cuidandome and comparison groups for depression and anxiety symptoms and maladaptive problem-solving. The intervention effect was largest for anxiety; at 6-month follow-up, Cuidandome participants had significantly lower anxiety scores than the comparison group. In addition, we observed a greater average point reduction in depression symptoms at 6 months among Cuidandome participants (5.7 points) than in the comparison group (3.7 points).Conclusions: A mental health program delivered via Zoom by a trained facilitator was feasible and acceptable to Latina immigrant women and can be beneficial for reducing anxiety and depression symptoms.

Remote arts therapy in collaborative virtual environment: A pilot case study,Good,"Li, C; Yip, PY",FRONTIERS IN VIRTUAL REALITY,2023,"Motivated by the unique experience of creating three-dimensional artworks in virtual reality (VR) and the need for teletherapy due to the global pandemic, we conducted this pilot case study to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using a custom-designed collaborative virtual environment (CVE) to enable remote arts therapy. Three participants (two females and one male) experiencing moderate to high stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) joined this study. Each participant had eight 45-minute one-on-one sessions with the therapist for eight consecutive weeks. These eight sessions covered eight art creation themes and were delivered following pre-designed protocols. The CVE was the only medium to facilitate the sessions, during which the therapist and the participants were physically separated into two rooms. The quantitative and qualitative results suggested that the CVE-enabled approach was generally feasible and was welcomed by both the participants and the therapist. However, more evidence of the approach's effectiveness in enhancing the participants' mental wellbeing is needed because the results of the pilot case study were affected by the pandemic. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach and the CVE were investigated from practicality and technological affordance perspectives. Potential improvements to the CVE are also proposed to better facilitate the practice of remote arts therapy in CVE.

Despite well-established efficacy of group psychosocial therapies targeting cognitive health in SSDs, dissemination of these programs remains limited. Remote delivery offers a promising strategy for increasing the programs' accessibility. Yet, little research has evaluated group therapies for cognitive health delivered in this way. Thus, we aimed to assess, from participants' and therapists' perspectives, the feasibility, acceptability, as well as levels and process of engagement in a videoconference delivery of group psychosocial therapies for SSD patients' cognitive health. Participants, outpatients, attended Action Based Cognitive Remediation or Metacognitive Training, both adapted for videoconference. Then, participants and therapists completed post-therapy questionnaires. Of the 28 participants attending at least one session, 75% completed more than half of sessions and seven dropped out. Technology did not appear to significantly hinder participation in the programs. All completing participants reported a positive experience with therapy, 67% were not bothered by the distance from the therapist, and 77% trusted that the information shared was kept confidential. Therapist-rated levels of attention M = 7.5/9 (SD = 1.04), participation M = 6.91/9 (SD = 1.32), and social interactions M = 5.31/9 (SD = 1.96) were satisfactory.

Responsible gambling: is it an alternative for prevention and treatment of pathological gambling?,Other,"Echeburua, E; De Corral, P",ADICCIONES,2008,"This paper deals with the new development of controlled gambling embedded in a harm-reduction context as a viable solution both for primary prevention at school and for treatment of some kinds of problematic gamblers. Pathological gambling significantly improves with psychological therapies, such as stimulus control and in vivo exposure with response prevention or cognitive interventions. In some cases psychopharmacological therapy may complement the benefits of treatment for pathological gambling when patients have comorbid depression or high impulsivity. However, in this mental disorder the goal of treatment (total abstinence or controlled gambling) is currently a controversial issue. Controlled gambling may be a therapeutic option for young gamblers or patients without severe dependence. Furthermore, controlled gambling may be a relevant issue for health education in schools, with a view to teaching teenagers how to cope with actual and virtual exposure to gambling. Likewise, the gambling industry and governments are involved in harm minimization initiatives.

VR use is facilitated by Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS) at pediatric hospitals. The primary aim of this study was to retrospectively review the safety of VR by analyzing adverse events after the utilization of VR under CCLS supervision. Secondary objectives were to characterize the efficacy of VR in enhancing patient cooperation, describe the integration of VR into Child Life services, and identify interventions that accompanied VR. Methods: The Stanford Chariot Program developed VR applications, customized VR interfaces, and patient head straps, and distributed these to CCLS.

Riding the Wave of Digital Transformation in Behavioral Medicine,Good,"Hesse, BW",ANNALS OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,2020,"Background Digital technologies provide a platform for accelerating science and broadening impact in behavioral medicine. Purpose The objective of this invited keynote presentation or paper is to offer a blueprint for navigating the rapidly changing waters of digital health. Methods A strategic literature review on digital health technologies in behavioral medicine was combined with a review of relevant policy initiatives to yield insights on: (a) knowledge building, (b) collaboration, and (c) public health stewardship. Results Digital platforms offer unprecedented leverage for accelerating science, facilitating collaboration, and advancing public health. Early successes in behavioral medicine demonstrated how digital platforms could extend the reach of theory-based behavioral therapeutics through increases in efficiency and scale. As medical investments in health information technology increased, the field of behavioral informatics emerged as the collaborative glue binding behavioral theory into a new generation of patient-facing applications, clinical decision support tools, evidence-based communication programs, and population health management strategies. As a leader within the interstitial space between medicine, psychology, and engineering, the Society of Behavioral Medicine is in a distinct position to exert influence on the ways in which our science is utilized to eliminate health disparities; improve support for patients, caregivers, and communities; to promote general health and well-being; and to offer relief when confronted with psychological pain or addiction.

Role of mHealth in overcoming the occurrence of post-stroke depression,Other,"Miranda, JJ; Moscoso, MG; Toyama, M; Cavero, V; Diez-Canseco, F; Ovbiagele, B",ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA,2018,"Depression associated with stroke affects roughly one-third of stroke survivors. Post-stroke depression (PSD) is thought to adversely influence functional outcome by limiting participation in rehabilitation, decreasing physical, social, and cognitive function, and affecting neuroplasticity thereby placing stroke survivors at high risk for future vascular events. PSD has also been associated with higher mortality rates after stroke. In Peru, a country where there is no national stroke program and mental health disorders are largely underdiagnosed and untreated, people with PSD are likely to be further challenged by dependency and impoverished conditions that will limit their use of ambulatory services, leading to inadequate clinical follow-up. In this scenario, mobile health (mHealth) technology offers a promising approach to extend access to high-quality and culturally tailored evidence-based psychological care to address PSD given that cell phone use, Internet connectivity, and digital health technology have met a rapid growth in the last years and thus contribute to the attainment of broader Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The limited evidence of the effectiveness of mHealth for PSD calls for researchers to fill a knowledge gap where Peru poses as an ideal setting because rapid expansion of digital technology and current mental healthcare reform could be leveraged to enhance post-stroke outcomes.

Objective: In this pilot study, we assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a health chatbot for new mothers of color. Methods: Rosie, a question-and-answer chatbot, was developed as a mobile app and is available to answer questions about pregnancy, parenting, and child development. From January 9, 2023, to February 9, 2023, participants were recruited using social media posts and through engagement with community organizations. Inclusion criteria included being aged >= 14 years, being a woman of color, and either being currently pregnant or having given birth within the past 6 months. Participants were randomly assigned to the Rosie treatment group (15/29, 52% received the Rosie app) or control group (14/29, 48% received a children's book each month) for 3 months. Those assigned to the treatment group could ask Rosie questions and receive an immediate response generated from Rosie's knowledgebase. Upon detection of a possible health emergency, Rosie sends emergency resources and relevant hotline information. In addition, a study staff member, who is a clinical social worker, reaches out to the participant within 24 hours to follow up. Preintervention and postintervention tests were completed to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate Rosie and describe changes across key health outcomes, including postpartum depression and the frequency of emergency room visits. These measurements were used to inform the clinical trial's sample size calculations. Results: Of 41 individuals who were screened and eligible, 31 (76%) enrolled and 29 (71%) were retained in the study. More than 87% (13/15) of Rosie treatment group members reported using Rosie daily (5/15, 33%) or weekly (8/15, 53%) across the 3-month study period. Most users reported that Rosie was easy to use (14/15, 93%) and provided responses quickly (13/15, 87%). The remaining issues identified included crashing of the app (8/15, 53%), and users were not satisfied with some of Rosie's answers (12/15, 80%). Mothers in both the Rosie treatment group and control group experienced a decline in depression scores from pretest to posttest periods, but the decline was statistically significant only among treatment group mothers (P=.008). In addition, a low proportion of treatment group infants had emergency room visits (1/11, 9%) compared with control group members (3/13, 23%). Nonetheless, no between-group differences reached statistical significance at P<.05. Conclusions: Rosie was found to be an acceptable, feasible, and appropriate intervention for ethnic and racial minority pregnant women and mothers of infants owing to the chatbot's ability to provide a personalized, flexible tool to increase the timeliness and accessibility of high-quality health information to individuals during a period of elevated health risks for the mother and child.",10.2196/51361,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,chatbot; health information; maternal and child health; health disparities; health equity; health informatics; preventive health care; postpartum care; patient education; newborn care; prenatal care; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/51361)

Results The study sample consisted of 60 predominantly White (72%) and female (78%) family members (30 intervention, 30 control). Anxiety and depression symptom severity decreased significantly over time in the intervention group but not in the control group. Family members logged in to the app a mean of 11.4 times (range, 1-53 times) and spent a mean of 50.16 minutes (range, 1.87-245.92 minutes) using the app. Conclusions Delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy to family members of critically ill patients via a smartphone app shows some efficacy in reducing PICS-F symptoms.

Safety and efficacy of a digital therapeutic for substance use disorder: Secondary analysis of data from a NIDA clinical trials network study,Not Multi User,"Maricich, YA; Nunes, EV; Campbell, ANC; Botbyl, JD; Luderer, HF",SUBSTANCE ABUSE,2022,"Background: Traditional treatments for substance use disorders (SUDs) rely heavily on face-to-face interactions, which pose substantial limitations for patients. A clinical trial of a digital therapeutic (DT), delivering behavioral therapy demonstrated safety and efficacy in a population including patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) not treated with buprenorphine, which is not a guideline-recommended approach. This study re-analyzed the data excluding patients with OUD to more closely approximate real-world patient populations. Methods: Secondary analysis of patients with substance use disorders related to alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, or other stimulants (n = 399, patients with OUD excluded) from a previously-published randomized controlled trial. Patients received 12-weeks of outpatient treatment-as-usual (TAU; n = 193) or TAU with reduced counseling plus a DT (n = 206) providing computerized cognitive behavioral therapy and contingency management. Primary outcomes were abstinence in weeks 9-12 and retention in treatment. Results: The 399 patients in this analysis (206 in the DT group and 193 in the TAU group) reported substance use disorders related to alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, or other stimulants (e.g., methamphetamines). Demographic and baseline characteristics including age, sex, race, education, and reported primary substance use disorder were balanced between treatment groups. Abstinence was significantly higher in the DT group compared to TAU (40.3 vs. 17.6%; p < 0.001) as was retention in therapy (76.2 vs. 63.2%, p = 0.004). Intergroup adverse event rates were not significantly different (p = 0.68). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that use of a DT safely increased abstinence (reduced substance use) and retention in treatment among patients with substance use disorders related to alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, or other stimulants (including methamphetamines).",10.1080/08897077.2022.2060425,wos,Substance Abuse,Prescription digital therapeutic; PDT; reSET; reSET-O; therapeutic education system; TES,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2022.2060425)
"Satisfaction, Perceived Usefulness, and Therapeutic Alliance as Correlates of Participant Engagement in a Pediatric Digital Mental Health Intervention: Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study",Other,"Huffman, L; Lawrence-Sidebottom, D; Huberty, J; Beatty, C; Roots, M; Roots, K; Parikh, A; Guerra, R",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Although evidence suggests that digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are effective alternatives to traditional mental health care, participant engagement continues to be an issue, especially for pediatric DMHIs. Extant studies of DMHIs among adults suggest that participants' satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and therapeutic alliance are closely tied to engagement. However, these associations have not been investigated among children and adolescents involved in DMHIs.Objective: To address these gaps in extant DMHI research, the purpose of this study was to (1) develop and implement a measure to assess satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and therapeutic alliance among children and adolescents participating in a DMHI and (2) investigate satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and therapeutic alliance as correlates of children's and adolescents' engagement in the DMHI.Methods: Members (children and adolescents) of a pediatric DMHI who had completed at least one session with a care provider (eg, coach or therapist) were eligible for inclusion in the study. Adolescent members and caregivers of children completed a survey assessing satisfaction with service, perceived usefulness of care, and therapeutic alliance with care team members.Results: This study provides evidence for the reliability and validity of an adolescent-and caregiver-reported user experience assessment in a pediatric DMHI. Moreover, our findings suggest that adolescents' and caregivers' satisfaction and perceived usefulness are salient correlates of youths' engagement with a DMHI.Conclusions: This study provides valuable preliminary evidence that caregivers' satisfaction and perceived usefulness are salient correlates of youths' engagement with a DMHI.

"Screening and assessment for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), guidance by personal pilots and support with individual digital trainings within intersectoral care: a study protocol of a randomized controlled trial",Not mental health,"Dahmen, A; Keller, FM; Derksen, C; Rinn, R; Becker, P; Lippke, S",BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES,2022,"Background Because the clinical patterns and symptoms that persist after a COVID-19 infection are diverse, a diagnosis of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is difficult to implement. The current research project therefore aims to evaluate the feasibility and the practicability of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and cross-sectoral treatment program consisting of a low-threshold online screening and holistic assessment for PACS. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate digital interventions and the use of so-called personal guides that may help to facilitate the recovery of PACS. Methods This German study consists of a low-threshold online screening for PACS where positively screened participants will be supported throughout by personal pilots. The personal pilots are aimed at empowering patients and helping them to navigate through the study and different treatment options. Patients will then be randomly assigned either to an intervention group (IG) or an active control group (ACG). The IG will receive a comprehensive assessment of physiological and psychological functioning to inform future treatment. The ACG does not receive the assessment but both groups will receive a treatment consisting of an individual digital treatment program (digital intervention platform and an intervention via a chatbot). This digital intervention is based on the needs identified during the assessment for participants in the IG. Compared to that, the ACG will receive a more common digital treatment program aiming to reduce PACS symptoms. Importantly, a third comparison group (CompG) will be recruited that does not receive any treatment. A propensity score matching will take place, ensuring comparability between the participants. Primary endpoints of the study are symptom reduction and return to work. Secondary outcomes comprise, for example, social participation and activities in daily life. Furthermore, the feasibility and applicability of the online screening tool, the holistic assessment, digital trainings, and personal pilots will be evaluated. Discussion This is one of the first large-scale studies to improve the diagnosis and the care of patients with PACS by means of empowerment. It is to be evaluated whether the methods utilized can be used for the German and international population.

Selective Prevention of Depression in Workers Using a Smartphone App: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Deady, M; Collins, DAJ; Lavender, I; Mackinnon, A; Glozier, N; Bryant, R; Christensen, H; Harvey, SB",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,"Background: There is increasing evidence that depression can be prevented; however, universal approaches have had limited success. Appropriate targeting of interventions to at-risk populations has been shown to have potential, but how to selectively determine at-risk individuals remains unclear. Workplace stress is a risk factor for depression and a target for intervention, but few interventions exist to prevent depression among workers at risk due to heightened stress.Objective: This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a smartphone-based intervention in reducing the onset of depression and improving related outcomes in workers experiencing at least moderate levels of stress.Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with participants who were currently employed and reported no clinically significant depression and at least moderate stress. The intervention group (n=1053) were assignedAnchored, a 30-day self-directed smartphone app-based cognitive behavioral-and mindfulness-based intervention. The attention-control group (n=1031) were assigned a psychoeducation website. Assessment was performed via web-based self-report questionnaires at baseline and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month postbaseline time points. The primary outcome was new depression caseness aggregated over the follow-up period. The secondary outcomes included depressive and anxiety symptoms, stress, well-being, resilience, work performance, work-related burnout, and quality of life. Analyses were conducted within an intention-to-treat framework using mixed modeling.Results: There was no significant between-group difference in new depression caseness (z score=0.69; P=.49); however, those in the Anchored arm had significantly greater depressive symptom reduction at 1 month (Cohen d=0.02; P=.049) and 6 months (Cohen d=0.08; P=.03). Anchored participants also showed significantly greater reduction in anxiety symptoms at 1 month (Cohen d=0.07; P=.04) and increased work performance at 1 month (Cohen d=0.07; P=.008) and 6 months (Cohen d=0.13; P=.01), compared with controls. Notably, for Anchored participants completing at least two-thirds of the intervention, there was a significantly lower rate of depression onset (1.1%, 95% CI 0.0%-3.7%) compared with controls (9.0%, 95% CI 6.8%-12.3%) at 1 month (z score=4.50; P<.001). Significant small to medium effect sizes for most secondary outcomes were seen in the highly engaged Anchored users compared with controls, with effects maintained at the 6-month follow-up for depressive symptoms, well-being, stress, and quality of life.Conclusions: Anchored was associated with a small comparative reduction in depressive symptoms compared with controls, although selective prevention of case-level depression was not observed in the intention-to-treat analysis. When users adequately engaged with the app, significant findings pertaining to depression prevention, overall symptom reduction, and functional improvement were found, compared with controls.

Self-help with minimal therapist contact for obsessive-compulsive disorder: a review,Good,"Mataix-Cols, D; Marks, IM",EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY,2006,"Though there are effective psychological and drug treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many patients remain inadequately treated or untreated. Making effective self-treatment guidance available may increase the number of patients being helped. In this review. database and manual literature searches were performed of case studies, open and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of bibliotherapy, self-help groups, telecare and computer-aided self-help for OCD. We found no RCTs of bibliotherapy or self-help groups for OCD. Three open studies showed the efficacy of brief exposure and ritual prevention (ERP) instructions delivered by a live therapist by phone. A vicarious ERP computer program was effective in a small open study. Fully interactive computer-aided self-help by ERP for OCD was efficacious in two open studies and a large multicentre RCT, and in a small RCT compliance and outcome with that program was enhanced by brief scheduled support from a clinician. Although more research is needed, self-help approaches have the potential to help many more patients who would otherwise remain inadequately treated or untreated. Their dissemination could save resources used by health care providers. We propose a stepped care model for the treatment of OCD. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS.

Edaravone (EDR), an approved free radical scavenger, has proven to have potential against AD by targeting multiple key pathologies including amyloid-beta (A beta), tau phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuro inflammation. To enable its oral use, novel edaravone formulation (NEF) was previously developed. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate safety and efficacy of NEF by using in vitro/ in vivo disease model. Materials and methods: In vitro therapeutic potential of NEF over EDR was studied against the cytotoxicity induced by copper metal ion, H2O2 and A beta 42 oligomer, and cellular uptake on SH-SY5Y695 amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) human neuroblastoma cell line. For in vivo safety and efficacy assessment, totally seven groups of APP/PS1 (five treatment groups, one each as a basal and sham control) and one group of C57BL/6 mice as a positive control for behavior tests were used. Three groups were orally treated for 3 months with NEF at an equivalent dose of EDR 46,138, and414 mu mo1/kg, whereas one group was supplied with each Donepezil (5.27 mu M/kg) and Soluplus (amount present in NEF of 414 mu mo1/kg dose of EDR). Behavior tests were conducted to assess motor function (open-field), anxiety-related behavior (open-field), and cognitive function (novel objective recognition test, Y-maze, and Morris water maze). For the safety assessment, general behavior, adverse effects, and mortality were recorded during the treatment period. Moreover, biochemical, hematological, and morphological parameters were determined. Results: Compared to EDR, NEF showed superior cellular uptake and neuroprotective effect in SH-SY5Y695 APP cell line. Furthermore, it showed nontoxicity of NEF up to 414 mu M/kg dose of EDR and its potential to reverse AD-like behavior deficits of APP/PS1 mice in a dose-dependent manner.

Sense of Community: Is it a Protective Factor for Military Veterans?,Not Digital,"Thomas, VJ; Bowie, SL",JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SERVICE RESEARCH,2016,"Veteran community reintegration (VCR) difficulties impact personal, interpersonal, educational/occupational, and community aspects of returning military service members. Sense of community (SOC), an individual's feeling of membership, influence, need fulfillment, and emotional connection, is the theoretical underpinnings for community-based practice interventions used with this population. This study investigates the mediating role of SOC on the relationship between mental health risk factors (PTSD, depression, and suicidal ideation), employment status, and VCR difficulties among military veterans. Data used in this study (N = 131) were collected by the authors for an outcome evaluation study in 2013. Results found a statistically significant path from depression to SOC and a significant and direct path from SOC to VCR difficulties, suggesting that veterans who are connected to their local communities may be more at risk for depression and VCR difficulties. Practice implications suggest social workers should look beyond the local community as a resilience factor for military veterans and explore more culturally relevant responses (such as veteran support at public universities, individual social support, and local/virtual military support groups).

Sensor-Controlled Digital Game for Heart Failure Self-management: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Not mental health,"Radhakrishnan, K; Julien, C; O'Hair, M; Tunis, R; Lee, GC; Rangel, A; Custer, J; Baranowski, T; Rathouz, PJ; Kim, MT",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2023,"Background: Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization among older adults in the United States. There are substantial racial and geographic disparities in HF outcomes, with patients living in southern US states having a mortality rate 69% higher than the national average. Self-management behaviors, particularly daily weight monitoring and physical activity, are extremely important in improving HF outcomes; however, patients typically have particularly low adherence to these behaviors. With the rise of digital technologies to improve health outcomes and motivate health behaviors, sensor-controlled digital games (SCDGs) have become a promising approach. SCDGs, which leverage sensor-connected technologies, offer the benefits of being portable and scalable and allowing for continuous observation and motivation of health behaviors in their real-world contexts. They are also becoming increasingly popular among older adults and offer an immersive and accessible way to measure self-management behaviors and improve adherence. No SCDGs have been designed for older adults or evaluated to test their outcomes.Objective: This randomized clinical trial aims to assess the efficacy of a SCDG in integrating the behavioral data of participants with HF from weight scale and activity tracker sensors to activate game progress, rewards, and feedback and, ultimately, to improve adherence to important self-management behaviors. Methods: A total of 200 participants with HF, aged & GE;45 years, will be recruited and randomized into 2 groups: the SCDG playing group (intervention group) and sensor-only group (control group). Both groups will receive a weight scale, physical activity tracker, and accompanying app, whereas only the intervention group will play the SCDG. This design, thereby, assesses the contributions of the game. All participants will complete a baseline survey as well as posttests at 6 and 12 weeks to assess the immediate effect of the intervention. They will also complete a third posttest at 24 weeks to assess the maintenance of behavioral changes. Efficacy and benefits will be assessed by measuring improvements in HF-related proximal outcomes (self-management behaviors of daily weight monitoring and physical activity) and distal outcomes (HF hospitalization, quality of life, and functional status) between baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 24. The primary outcome measured will be days with weight monitoring, for which this design provides at least 80% power to detect differences between the 2 groups.Results: Recruitment began in the fall of 2022, and the first patient was enrolled in the study on November 7, 2022. Recruitment of the last participant is expected in quarter 1 of 2025. Publication of complete results and data from this study is expected in 2026.Conclusions: This project will generate insight and guidance for scalable and easy-to-use digital gaming solutions to motivate persistent adherence to HF self-management behaviors and improve health outcomes among individuals with HF.

Sex Offender Treatment Programs Delivered In-Person or Virtually for Adults Convicted of Sexual Offences in Various Settings: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Guidelines,Good,"Subramonian A, Severn M.",Sex Offender Treatment Programs Delivered In-Person or Virtually for Adults Convicted of Sexual Offences in Various Settings: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Guidelines,2020,"Sexual offending has been considered a serious crime and social issue because of the nature of the offence and its short-term and long-term effects on victims. According to the Criminal Code of Canada, sexual offence involves a wide range of criminal acts ranging from unwanted sexual touching to sexual violence resulting in serious physical injury or disfigurement to the victim. It includes sexual assaults (Level 1, 2), aggravated sexual assault (Level 3) and other sexual offences addressing offences primarily aimed at children., It is a heterogenous category involving child molesting, rape, exhibitionism, distribution and consumption of child pornography, etc.

Therapeutic interventions aiming to reduce the likelihood of reoffending (recidivism) is the core of treatment programs for individuals convicted of sexual offences (sometimes referred to in the literature as sex offender treatment programs, and herein also called sexual offence programs). Various pharmacological methods (e.g., hormonal treatment with medroxyprogesterone or cyproterone acetate, serotonergic antidepressants) and surgical methods (surgical castration) have been used in individuals convicted of sex offences. Comprehensive psychological treatment options including components ranging from behavior therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and relapse prevention have been developed as treatment programs for individuals convicted of sexual offences., These programs cover several domains ranging from inappropriate attitudes, problematic sexual arousal and deviant sexual preferences to substance abuse, anger control, impact and empathy, relationship issues and life skills. Although early evidence provided contradicting results on the effectiveness of psychological treatments for those convicted of sexual offences,, after the formation of the Collaborative Outcome Data committee in 1997 and the introduction of guidelines for quality evaluation of studies rigorous high quality meta-analyses (MAs) have been done showing significant effects for CBT-based treatments for sexual offences.,

According to Correctional Services Canada, individuals who have committed sexual offences would be referred to the Integrated Correctional Program Model (ICPM) for men and the Women’s Sex Offender Program (WSOP) for women. Based on risk assessment, in ICPM, individuals may be assigned to a high intensity or moderate intensity CBT-based program followed by maintenance programs in an institution or in the community. Institution and community-based maintenance programs are for individuals with high- to moderate risk of reoffending who need continued support where risk assessment can be done on an ongoing basis. There are also CBT-based programs offered to offenders released in probation to the community. It is also important to incorporate culturally specific values in the sexual offence programs to better support offenders from various cultural groups. Examples of such culturally specific programs include the Tupiq program developed for Inuit males convicted of sex offences, Mamisaq Qamutiik program in Iqaluit and the program by The Native Clan Organization of Manitoba.,

In the era of telehealth, there has been interest in delivering sexual offence programs through videoconferencing or other virtual methods. The purpose of this review is to summarize evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of sexual offence programs offered in the community, and virtually. Additionally, the report will also summarize evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of culturally specific sexual offence programs, and evidence-based guidelines for best practice models.",,pubmed,NA,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/)

Objective: Sexual well-being can contribute significantly to the overall quality of women's lives. This qualitative study aimed to examine sexual activity, functioning, and satisfaction in a large sample of postmenopausal women from the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) Methods: Thematic analysis was used to evaluate the free-text data of the Fallowfield Sexual Activity Questionnaire (FSAQ) completed by UKCTOCS participants at baseline before annual screening. Results: A total of 24,305 women completed the baseline FSAQ and 4,525 (19%) provided free-text data, with 4,418 comments eligible for analysis. Median age was 64 years; 65% had a partner and 22.5% were sexually active. Four interrelated themes were derived: partner availability, physical and sexual health, mental well-being, and interpersonal relationships. Primary reason for absence of sexual activity was lack of a partner, mainly due to widowhood (n = 1,000). Women discussed how partner's medical condition (27%) or sexual dysfunction (13.5%), their own physical health (18%) or menopause-related symptoms (12.5%), and prescribed medication (7%) affected sexual activity. Impact of low libido in self (16%) or partner (7%), relationship problems (10.5%) or logistics (6%), and perceptions of ageing (9%) were also mentioned. Few (3%) referred to positive sexual experiences or had sought medical help for sexual problems (6%). Conclusions: This qualitative analysis explored postmenopausal women's perspective on their sexual functioning. Having an intimate partner and good physical health are key factors for continuation of sexual activity and satisfaction.

Studies that focused on the digital sharing of clinical notes or EHRs with people affected by mental health conditions up to September 2021 were included. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Extension for Scoping Reviews guided narrative synthesis and reporting of findings. Results: Of the 1034 papers screened, 31 were included in this review. The studies used mostly qualitative methods or surveys and were predominantly published after 2018 in the United States. PAEHRs were examined in outpatient (n=29) and inpatient settings (n=11), and a third of all research was conducted in Veterans Affairs Mental Health. Narrative synthesis allowed the integration of findings according to the different stakeholders. First, SUs reported mainly positive experiences with PAEHRs, such as increased trust in their clinician, health literacy, and empowerment. Negative experiences were related to inaccurate notes, disrespectful language use, or uncovering of undiscussed diagnoses. Second, for health care professionals, concerns outweigh the benefits of sharing EHRs, including an increased clinical burden owing to more documentation efforts and possible harm triggered by reading the notes. Third, care partners gained a better understanding of their family members' mental problems and were able to better support them when they had access to their EHR. Finally, policy stakeholders and experts addressed ethical challenges and recommended the development of guidelines and trainings to better prepare both clinicians and SUs on how to write and read notes. Conclusions: PAEHRs in MHC may strengthen user involvement, patients' autonomy, and shift medical treatment to a coproduced process. Acceptance issues among health care professionals align with the findings from general health settings. However, the corpus of evidence on digital sharing of EHRs with people affected by mental health conditions is limited. Above all, further research is needed to examine the clinical effectiveness, efficiency, and implementation of this sociotechnical intervention.",10.2196/34170,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,electronic health record; open notes; user involvement; patient advocacy; patient portal; patient rights; collaborative health care; participation; coproduction; system transformation; health care reform,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/34170)
Sharing Lived Experience: Describing a Virtual Counselor-Facilitated LGBTQ plus Support Group for Disordered Eating,Good,"Brownstone, LM; Hunsicker, MJ; Palazzolo, LPA; Dinneen, JL; Kelly, DA; Stennes, J; Scanga, S",PSYCHOLOGY OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER DIVERSITY,2023,"A growing body of literature has highlighted the disproportionate impact of disordered eating on sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals. As such, specialized and affirming treatment is needed for SGM individuals with disordered eating, and research is needed to better understand what this treatment should include. The current study investigates a rolling, open, counselor-facilitated, free, virtual support group for SGM individuals with disordered eating to better understand support and healing processes, which in turn could be applied or expanded upon in other treatment settings. Participants were 27 SGM adults. All participants completed online surveys, and some (15/27) also completed semistructured focus groups about their experiences in the support group to reflect on shared meaning created within the group and ways that the counselor-facilitated support group fostered learning and healing related to disordered eating, mental health recovery, gender, and sexual identity. Inductive reflexive thematic analysis yielded the following themes: (a) community building and safety, (b) a crucially important space, (c) intersectional healing and insight, (d) seeing futures and building hope, and (e) ripple effects. Results indicate the power of alternative support spaces for disordered eating recovery among SGM individuals and illuminate potential directions for queer-affirming disordered eating treatment.

Objective: The objective was to conduct economic evaluation of SMART4MD compared to standard care in Sweden from a healthcare provider perspective based on a 6-month follow-up period. Methods: Three hundred forty-five dyads were enrolled: 173 dyads in the intervention group and 172 in standard care. The primary outcome measures for PwMCI and informal caregivers were quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The results are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and confidence intervals are calculated using non-parametric bootstrap procedure. Results: For PwMCI, the mean difference in total costs between intervention and standard care was (sic)12 (95%CI: -2090 to 2115) (US$ =(sic) 1.19) and the mean QALY change was -0.004 (95%CI: -0.009 to 0.002).

Digital self-management approaches could improve this disparity, potentially bolstering outreach and providing easy, relatively low-cost access to pain self-management interventions. Objective: This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the short-term efficacy of EPIO (ie, inspired by the Greek goddess for the soothing of pain, Epione), a digital self-management intervention, for people living with chronic pain. Methods: Patients (N=266) were randomly assigned to either the EPIO intervention (n=132) or a care-as-usual control group (n=134). Outcome measures included pain interference (Brief Pain Inventory; primary outcome measure), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), self-regulatory fatigue (Self-Regulatory Fatigue 18 scale), health-related quality of life (SF-36 Short Form Health Survey), pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), and pain acceptance (Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire). Linear regression models used change scores as the dependent variables. Results: The participants were primarily female (210/259, 81.1%), with a median age of 49 (range 22-78) years and a variety of pain conditions. Analyses (n=229) after 3 months revealed no statistically significant changes for the primary outcome of pain interference (P=.84), but significant reductions in the secondary outcomes of depression (mean difference -0.90; P=.03) and self-regulatory fatigue (mean difference -2.76; P=.008) in favor of the intervention group. No other statistically significant changes were observed at 3 months (all P>.05).

"Shyness programme: longer term benefits, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability",Good,"Titov, N; Andrews, G; Johnston, L; Schwencke, G; Choi, I",AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY,2009,"Objective: In two randomized controlled trials Titov et al. demonstrated significant benefit from an Internet- and email-based treatment programme for social phobia: the Shyness programme. Data are presented about the longer term outcomes (6 months after treatment), cost-effectiveness relative to face-to-face treatment, and the acceptability of the programme to participants. Method: Participants completed outcome and acceptability questionnaires at 6 months after treatment. Repeated measures analyses of variance were calculated using an intention-to-treat design. Cost-effectiveness in years lived with disability averted were calculated based on between-group effect sizes. Results: A total of 59% of treatment group participants completed the 6 month follow-up questionnaires. Between post-treatment and 6 month follow up participants continued to make improvements in symptoms of social phobia, while maintaining improvements in mood, psychological distress, and disability. At 6 month follow up the mean within-group effect size (Cohen's d) for the two social phobia measures increased from 1.2 to 1.4. Cost-effectiveness in years lived with disability (YLD) averted was calculated as one-quarter that of face-to-face group treatment, or $AUD1495 for one YLD gained, compared to $AUD5686/YLD gained. Participants rated the Internet treatment to be as effective and helpful as face-to-face treatment.

However, not everyone responds well to this treatment, and it is unclear what determines individual differences in response. The broader aim of this work is to examine to what extent response to CBT-I is due to genetic and environmental factors. The purpose of this pilot study is to examine feasibility of a design to test hypotheses focusing on an unselected sample, that is, without selection on insomnia complaints, in order to plan a larger behavioural genetics study where most participants will likely not have an insomnia disorder. Methods and analysis A two parallel-group randomised controlled trial is being conducted across three London universities. Female students (minimum age 18 years) enrolled on a psychology programme at one of the three sites were invited to participate. The target number of participants to be recruited is 240. Following baseline assessments, participants were randomly allocated to either the treatment group, where they received weekly sessions of digital CBT-I for 6 weeks, or the control group, where they completed an online puzzle each week for 6 weeks. Follow-up assessments have taken place mid-intervention (3 weeks) and end of intervention (6 weeks). A 6-month follow-up assessment will also occur.

The control group was recruited prior to the intervention group to avoid contamination. Of the 117 mothers enrolled, 29 intervention and 29 control mothers com-pleted the study. Five questionnaires were administered at baseline and 6-months to measure maternal depression, empa-thy, beliefs about children's emotions, intelligence mindsets, and app use. At 6 months, questionnaires assessing parenting stress, reflective functioning, and perceived value of app were also administered.RESULTS: Mothers in the final sample were similar to those who did not complete the study, except more mothers who dropped out were recruited during COVID-19 and had a lower empathetic subscale score. No differences were found between groups at pre-or post-test.

Smartphone Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as an Adjunct to Pharmacotherapy for Refractory Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Mantani, A; Kato, T; Furukawa, TA; Horikoshi, M; Imai, H; Hiroe, T; Chino, B; Funayama, T; Yonemoto, N; Zhou, Q; Kawanishi, N",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2017,"Background: In the treatment of major depression, antidepressants are effective but not curative. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also effective, alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy, but accessibility is a problem. Objective: The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone CBT app as adjunctive therapy among patients with antidepressant-resistant major depression. Methods: A multisite, assessor-masked, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted in 20 psychiatric clinics and hospitals in Japan. Participants were eligible if they had a primary diagnosis of major depression and were antidepressant-refractory after taking one or more antidepressants at an adequate dosage for four or more weeks. After a 1-week run-in in which participants started the medication switch and had access to the welcome session of the app, patients were randomized to medication switch alone or to medication switch plus smartphone CBT app via the centralized Web system. The smartphone app, called Kokoro-app (kokoro means mind in Japanese), included sessions on self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring presented by cartoon characters. The primary outcome was depression severity as assessed by masked telephone assessors with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at week 9. The secondary outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Ratings (FIBSER). Results: In the total sample (N=164), 81 participants were allocated to the smartphone CBT in addition to medication change and 83 to medication change alone. In the former group, all but one participant (80/81, 99%) completed at least half, and 71 (88%) completed at least six of eight sessions. In the intention-to-treat analysis, patients allocated the CBT app scored 2.48 points (95% CI 1.23-3.72, P<.001; standardized mean difference 0.40) lower on PHQ-9 than the control at week 9. The former group also scored 4.1 points (95% CI 1.5-6.6, P=.002) lower on BDI-II and 0.76 points (95% CI -0.05 to 1.58, P=.07) lower on FIBSER. In the per-protocol sample (comfortable with the smartphone app, still symptomatic, and adherent to medication with mild or less side effects after run-in), the intervention group (n=60) scored 1.72 points (95% CI 0.25-3.18, P=.02) lower on PHQ-9, 3.2 points (95% CI -0.01 to 6.3, P=.05) lower on BDI-II, and 0.75 points (95% CI 0.03-1.47, P=.04) lower on FIBSER than the control (n=57). The treatment benefits were maintained up to week 17. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a smartphone CBT in the treatment of clinically diagnosed depression.

Smartphone Delivery of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Postintensive Care Syndrome-Family: Protocol for a Pilot Study,Other,"Petrinec, AB; Hughes, JW; Zullo, MD; Wilk, C; George, RL",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2021,"Background: Family members of critically ill patients experience symptoms of postintensive care syndrome-family (PICS-F), including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Postintensive care syndrome-family reduces the quality of life of the families of critically ill patients and may impede the recovery of such patients. Cognitive behavioral therapy has become a first-line nonpharmacological treatment of many psychological symptoms and disorders, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. With regard to managing mild-to-moderate symptoms, the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy via mobile technology without input from a clinician has been found to be feasible and well accepted, and its efficacy rivals that of face-to-face therapy. Objective: The purpose of our pilot study is to examine the efficacy of using a smartphone mobile health (mHealth) app to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy and diminish the severity and prevalence of PICS-F symptoms in family members of critically ill patients. Methods: For our pilot study, 60 family members of critically ill patients will be recruited. A repeated-measures longitudinal study design that involves the randomization of participants to 2 groups (the control and intervention groups) will be used. The intervention group will receive cognitive behavioral therapy, which will be delivered via a smartphone mHealth app. Bandura's social cognitive theory and an emphasis on mental health self-efficacy form the theoretical framework of the study. Results: Recruitment for the study began in August 2020. Data collection and analysis are expected to be completed by March 2022.

Smartphone and tablet self management apps for asthma,Not mental health,"Belisario, JSM; Huckvale, K; Greenfield, G; Car, J; Gunn, LH",COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,2013,"Background Asthma is one of the most common long-term conditions worldwide, which places considerable pressure on patients, communities and health systems. The major international clinical guidelines now recommend the inclusion of self management programmes in the routine management of patients with asthma. These programmes have been associated with improved outcomes in patients with asthma. However, the implementation of self management programmes in clinical practice, and their uptake by patients, is still poor. Recent developments in mobile technology, such as smartphone and tablet computer apps, could help develop a platform for the delivery of self management interventions that are highly customisable, low-cost and easily accessible. Objectives To assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of using smartphone and tablet apps to facilitate the self management of individuals with asthma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register (CAGR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Health Library, Compendex/Inspec/Referex, IEEEXplore, ACMDigital Library, CiteSeerx and CAB abstracts via Web of Knowledge. We also searched registers of current and ongoing trials and the grey literature. We checked the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references. We searched for studies published from 2000 onwards. The latest search was run in June 2013. Selection criteria We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared self management interventions for patients with clinician-diagnosed asthma delivered via smartphone apps to self management interventions delivered via traditional methods (e. g. paper-based asthma diaries). Data collection and analysis We used standard methods expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcomes were symptom scores; frequency of healthcare visits due to asthma exacerbations or complications and health-related quality of life. Main results We included two RCTs with a total of 408 participants. We found no cluster RCTs, controlled before and after studies or interrupted time series studies that met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Both RCTs evaluated the effect of a mobile phone-based asthma self management intervention on asthma control by comparing it to traditional, paper-based asthma self management. One study allowed participants to keep daily entries of their asthma symptoms, asthma medication usage, peak flow readings and peak flow variability on their mobile phone, from which their level of asthma control was calculated remotely and displayed together with the corresponding asthma self management recommendations. In the other study, participants recorded the same readings twice daily, and they received immediate self management feedback in the form of a three-colour traffic light display on their phones. Participants falling into the amber zone of their action plan twice, or into the red zone once, received a phone call from an asthma nurse who enquired about the reasons for their uncontrolled asthma. We did not conduct a meta-analysis of the data extracted due to the considerable degree of heterogeneity between these studies. Instead we adopted a narrative synthesis approach. Overall, the results were inconclusive and we judged the evidence to have a GRADE rating of low quality because further evidence is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. In addition, there was not enough information in one of the included studies to assess the risk of bias for the majority of the domains. Although the other included study was methodologically rigorous, it was not possible to blind participants or personnel in the study. Moreover, there are concerns in both studies in relation to attrition bias and other sources of bias. One study showed that the use of a smartphone app for the delivery of an asthma self management programme had no statistically significant effect on asthma symptom scores (mean difference (MD) 0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.25), asthma-related quality of life (MD of mean scores 0.02, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.39), unscheduled visits to the emergency department (OR 7.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 140.76) or frequency of hospital admissions (odds ratio (OR) 3.07, 95% CI 0.32 to 29.83). The other included study found that the use of a smartphone app resulted in higher asthma-related quality of life scores at six-month follow-up (MD5.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 9.52 for the physical component score of the SF-12 questionnaire; MD 6.00, 95% CI 2.51 to 9.49 for the mental component score of the SF-12 questionnaire), improved lung function (PEFR) at four (MD 27.80, 95% CI 4.51 to 51.09), five (MD 31.40, 95% CI 8.51 to 54.29) and six months (MD 39.20, 95% CI 16.58 to 61.82), and reduced visits to the emergency department due to asthma-related complications (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.99). Both studies failed to find any statistical differences in terms of adherence to the intervention and occurrence of other asthma-related complications. Authors' conclusions The current evidence base is not sufficient to advise clinical practitioners, policy-makers and the general public with regards to the use of smartphone and tablet computer apps for the delivery of asthma self management programmes. In order to understand the efficacy of apps as standalone interventions, future research should attempt to minimise the differential clinical management of patients between control and intervention groups.

MethodsThe study setting will be the Department of Geriatrics at Gia Dinh People's Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. Inclusion criteria will be the family caregivers of people with dementia living in the community, who attend the Department and use smartphones. In phase 1, we will identify the intervention content with family caregivers of people with dementia through 20 in-depth interviews to determine what information and skills they need. In phase 2, a pilot randomized control trial design will be conducted, with 60 family caregivers of people with dementia being assigned to the intervention or control group by the block randomization method with a ratio of 1:1. The intervention will include weekly, online, psycho-educational, group sessions hosted on the Zalo app. The participants will complete questionnaires at baseline, immediately postintervention, and 3-month postintervention. The feasibility of the intervention and methodology will be assessed, including the rates of recruitment, retention, completion of assessments, and acceptability of the intervention.

Smartphone apps for the improvement of body satisfaction? Results of a randomized controlled pilot study on mobile attention bias modification,Not Multi User,"Schmidt, J; Martin, A",PSYCHOTHERAPEUT,2021,"Background Body dissatisfaction is a symptom of a variety of mental disorders. Implicit processes, such as attention biases, contribute to the maintenance of body dissatisfaction. These are expressed among others in a focus on socially threatening stimuli. Such implicit processes could be positively influenced by attention-based cognitive bias modification (CBM-A) to improve body satisfaction. Aim of the study The present pilot study aimed at evaluating whether a 1-week CBM-A intervention via a smartphone app can improve the body and appearance satisfaction in young women. Material and methods In a randomized controlled trial 40 female participants (average age 24.5 years) were either allocated to an intervention group (IG) using a CBM-A app with socially threatening facial stimuli or to a waiting group (CG). Before and after the 1-week intervention period the body and appearance satisfaction as well as self-esteem and well-being of the participants were collated and evaluated by variance analysis. Results In the IG the body and appearance satisfaction improved significantly over the period of the CBM-A intervention (ps < 0.019), whereas no comparable effect was observed in the CG. There were no significant effects on self-esteem and well-being in either group. Overall, the mobile CBM-A-intervention was well accepted. Conclusion The preliminary results indicate a potential for the application of smartphone-based CBM-A interventions to improve body satisfaction in young women as a supplement, for example to psychotherapy; however, mediating processes and a possible application in clinical samples should be evaluated in future studies with larger numbers of participants.",10.1007/s00278-021-00517-2,wos,Psychology,Body dysmorphic disorder; Attentional bias; Cognitive bias modification; Implicit processes; Mobile health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s00278-021-00517-2)

There is, however, no standard intervention for ameliorating FCR. Our clinical experience and previous studies have suggested the potential benefits of problem-solving therapy (PST) and behavioural activation (BA). Given the huge number of cancer survivors and limited number of therapists to competently conduct PST and BA, we have developed PST and BA smartphone applications. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the smartphone-based PST (Kaiketsu-App) and BA (Genki-App) apps in reducing FCR in patients with breast cancer. Methods and analysis The SMartphone Intervention to LEssen fear of cancer recurrence project is an open-label, individually randomised, parallel-group trial.

First self-help apps for eating disorders have been developed recently. However, studies assessing the efficacy of such apps are scarce. A smartphone app could prevent further weight reduction and increase commitment during waiting time for outpatient treatment, especially for adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN). In this study protocol, a randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a smartphone-enhanced low-threshold intervention for AN during waiting time is described. Methods and analysis 30 adolescents with AN aged 12-19 years will be recruited at three child and adolescent psychiatry centres in Germany. All participants will be randomised to consultations only or consultations and the use of the Jourvie Research app. The app will be installed either on their own smartphone or on a research device. The participants will receive biweekly to monthly consultations for 3 months to review meal plans and weight management with a clinician. In addition, the Jourvie Research app for meal, behaviour and emotion protocolling will be provided to the intervention group. The protocols will be discussed with a clinician during the consultations. Dialectical behaviour therapy-informed skills for tension regulation to increase compliance with the meal plan will be taught in the intervention group and the app will remind the participant of a skill in a moment of need. The primary outcome is the age-adjusted and height-adjusted weight gain in standard deviation score after 3 months.

Design A two-arm unblinded feasibility RCT. Setting Six NHS EIP services in England. Participants Adults using EIP services who own an Android Smartphone. Participants were recruited until the recruitment target was met (n=40). Interventions Participants were randomised with a 1:1 allocation to one of two conditions: (1) treatment as usual from EIP services (TAU) or (2) TAU plus access to My Journey 3 on their own Smartphone.

Smoking Cessation Intervention Trial Outcomes for Sexual and Gender Minority Young Adults,Good,"Vogel, EA; Thrul, J; Humfleet, GL; Delucchi, KL; Ramo, DE",HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY,2019,"Objective: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals are more likely to smoke than are non-SGM individuals. It is unclear whether smoking cessation interventions for young adults are effective in the SGM population. The purpose of this study was to compare smoking cessation, other health risk behaviors, and intervention usability between SGM and non-SGM young adult smokers participating in a digital smoking cessation intervention trial. Methods: Young adult smokers (N = 500; 135 SGM) were assigned to a 90-day Facebook smoking cessation intervention (treatment) or referred to Smokefree. gov (control). Intervention participants were assigned to private Facebook groups tailored to their readiness to quit smoking. Participants reported their smoking status and other health risk behaviors at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Usability of the intervention (i.e., perceptions of the intervention and treatment engagement) was assessed in the intervention group at 3 months. Results: Smoking cessation and intervention usability did not significantly differ between SGM participants and non-SGM participants. A greater proportion of SGM participants were at high risk for physical inactivity over the 12-month follow-up period (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55, p = .005). Conclusion: SGM and non-SGM young adult smokers did not differ in their smoking cessation rates, perceptions of, or engagement in a digital intervention. Health risk behavior patterns were mostly similar; however, the disparity in physical activity between SGM and non-SGM smokers widened over time.

Objective: Through a national cross-sectional survey in the United States, we aimed to describe and compare the characteristics of populations with and without mental health issues (depression or anxiety disorders), including physical health, sleep, and alcohol use. We also examined the patterns of social networking service use, PGHD, and attitudes toward health information sharing and activities among the participants, which provided nationally representative estimates. Methods: We drew data from the 2019 Health Information National Trends Survey of the National Cancer Institute. The participants were divided into 2 groups according to mental health status. Then, we described and compared the characteristics of the social determinants of health, health status, sleeping and drinking behaviors, and patterns of social networking service use and health information data sharing between the 2 groups. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess the predictors of mental health. All the analyses were weighted to provide nationally representative estimates. Results: Participants with mental health issues were significantly more likely to be younger, White, female, and lower-income; have a history of chronic diseases; and be less capable of taking care of their own health. Regarding behavioral health, they slept <6 hours on average, had worse sleep quality, and consumed more alcohol. In addition, they were more likely to visit and share health information on social networking sites, write online diary blogs, participate in online forums or support groups, and watch health-related videos. Conclusions: This study illustrates that individuals with mental health issues have inequitable social determinants of health, poor physical health, and poor behavioral health. However, they are more likely to use social networking platforms and services, share their health information, and actively engage with PGHD. Leveraging these digital technologies and services could be beneficial for developing tailored and effective strategies for self-monitoring and self-management.",10.2196/30898,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,patient-generated health data; social network; population health informatics; mental health; social determinants of health; health data sharing; technology acceptability; mobile phone; mobile health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/30898)
Social Prescription Interventions Addressing Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Meta-Review Integrating On-the-Ground Resources,Not Digital,"Paquet, C; Whitehead, J; Shah, RS; Adams, AM; Dooley, D; Spreng, RN; Aunio, AL; Dube, L",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Social prescription programs represent a viable solution to linking primary care patients to nonmedical community resources for improving patient well-being. However, their success depends on the integration of patient needs with local resources. This integration could be accelerated by digital tools that use expressive ontology to organize knowledge resources, thus enabling the seamless navigation of diverse community interventions and services tailored to the needs of individual users. This infrastructure bears particular relevance for older adults, who experience a range of social needs that impact their health, including social isolation and loneliness. An essential first step in enabling knowledge mobilization and the successful implementation of social prescription initiatives to meet the social needs of older adults is to incorporate the evidence-based academic literature on what works, with on-the-ground solutions in the community. Objective: This study aims to integrate scientific evidence with on-the-ground knowledge to build a comprehensive list of intervention terms and keywords related to reducing social isolation and loneliness in older adults. Methods: A meta-review was conducted using a search strategy combining terms related to older adult population, social isolation and loneliness, and study types relevant to reviews using 5 databases. Review extraction included intervention characteristics, outcomes (social [eg, loneliness, social isolation, and social support] or mental health [eg, psychological well-being, depression, and anxiety]), and effectiveness (reported as consistent, mixed, or not supported). Terms related to identified intervention types were extracted from the reviewed literature as well as descriptions of corresponding community services in Montreal, Canada, available from web-based regional, municipal, and community data sources. Results: The meta-review identified 11 intervention types addressing social isolation and loneliness in older adults by either increasing social interactions, providing instrumental support, promoting mental and physical well-being, or providing home and community care. Group-based social activities, support groups with educational elements, recreational activities, and training or use of information and communication technologies were the most effective in improving outcomes. Examples of most intervention types were found in community data sources. Terms derived from the literature that were the most commonly congruent with those describing existing community services were related to telehealth, recreational activities, and psychological therapy. However, several discrepancies were observed between review-based terms and those addressing the available services. Conclusions: A range of interventions found to be effective at addressing social isolation and loneliness or their impact on mental health were identified from the literature, and many of these interventions were represented in services available to older residents in Montreal, Canada. However, different terms were occasionally used to describe or categorize similar services across data sources.

Social support predicts sleep quality in people with multiple sclerosis during the COVID-19 pandemic,Not Digital,"Harris, TP; Zaeske, LM; Ludwig, R; Baker, S; Lynch, S; Thuringer, A; Bruce, J; Siengsukon, CF",MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS,2022,"Background: Poor sleep quality is one of the most prominent patient-reported problems in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in PwMS having less contact with physicians, therapists, support groups, and family, which led to decreased access to typical supports. The purpose of this study was to assess how social support impacted sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic in PwMS within the United States.Methods: Anonymous surveys were utilized to gather data from February - May 2021 from 209 PwMS during their return appointments (face-to-face and virtual) at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC)'s MS Clinic in the United States. SPSS 27 was used to run four regressions in order to determine if social support predicted sleep quality with and without the inclusion of covariates (age, education, disability, anxiety/ depression).Results: The results indicate that overall feelings of being socially supported predict sleep quality. Additionally, various facets of social support predict sleep quality, even when controlling for covariates. Interestingly, while depression and anxiety were significant predictors of sleep quality, those constructs do not attenuate the social support-sleep relationship.Conclusion: These findings will provide key information pertaining to the association between social support and sleep in PwMS during COVID-19 where typical supports were limited.

Stereotype confirmation concerns predict dropout from cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder,Not Multi User,"Johnson, S; Price, M; Mehta, N; Anderson, PL",BMC PSYCHIATRY,2014,"Background: There are high attrition rates observed in efficacy studies for social anxiety disorder, and research has not identified consistent nor theoretically meaningful predictors of dropout. Pre-treatment symptom severity and demographic factors, such as age and gender, are sometimes predictive of dropout. The current study examines a theoretically meaningful predictor of attrition based on experiences associated with social group membership rather than differences between social group categories-fear of confirming stereotypes. Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing two cognitive behavioral treatments for social anxiety disorder: virtual reality exposure therapy and exposure group therapy. Participants (N = 74) with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder who were eligible to participate in the parent study and who self-identified as either African American (n = 31) or Caucasian (n = 43) completed standardized self-report measures of stereotype confirmation concerns (SCC) and social anxiety symptoms as part of a pre-treatment assessment battery. Results: Hierarchical logistic regression showed that greater stereotype confirmation concerns were associated with higher dropout from therapy-race, age, gender, and pre-treatment symptom severity were not. Group treatment also was associated with higher dropout. Conclusions: These findings urge further research on theoretically meaningful predictors of attrition and highlight the importance of addressing cultural variables, such as the experience of stereotype confirmation concerns, during treatment of social anxiety to minimize dropout from therapy.",10.1186/s12888-014-0233-8,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,Social anxiety; Dropout; Stereotypes; Virtual reality exposure; Cognitive behavioral therapy,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-014-0233-8)

Effective program adaptations have continued relevance for the expansion of access to family-focused addiction services beyond the pandemic itself, particularly for rural or other hard to reach populations. Seventy-three semi-structured interviews were conducted with the five agencies participating in the implementation of the In-Home Recovery Program (IHRP), an in-home, substance use disorder (SUD) treatment program. Using a rapid analysis approach two coders analyzed interviews for recurring concepts and themes. Facilitators for adapting services included: (1) the introduction of virtual toxicology screens, (2) helping parents access technology, (3) assisting parents with non-identified children to decrease their stress, and (4) anticipating reoccurrences of substances during the pandemic. Barriers to adapting services included: (1) engaging young children in virtual treatment, (2) privacy, and (3) engaging in telehealth with parents experiencing domestic violence or reoccurrence of substances. Findings reveal virtual substance use treatment is possible. Facilitators to adaptation such as providing access to technology and virtual toxicology screens demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of utilizing telehealth interventions for substance use. Barriers to adaptations were primarily related to the infant mental health component. Telehealth is likely not appropriate for children below the age of five. Individual sessions focusing on caregiving, rather than dyadic treatment may be more suitable to virtual formats.",10.1007/s10488-023-01300-y,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Family-based recovery; COVID-19 pandemic; Child welfare system; Parent; Child treatment; Implementation; Substance use treatment,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10488-023-01300-y)
Strengthening positive social pathways via digital social applications in individuals with social skills deficits: A scoping review,Good,"Salehi, A; Salehi, E; Mosadeghi-Nik, M; Sargeant, S; Fatehi, F",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY,2021,"Background: Effective digital social capital interventions have great potential to establish trusted social pathways to access supportive services and to enable talking about issues contributing to distress. Aim: This review explores the digital social capital interventions used in individuals with social skills deficits, and the best social health outcomes achieved. Method: Four databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and Web of Science) were used with no time limitation, and 33 papers were included. Results: A diverse range of digital social programs was used for social capital improvement based on individuals' characteristics (e.g. age range and illnesses). Programs ranged from digitally-enhanced self-help or self-guided treatment (to enhance the self-efficacy of individuals), to group treatments and/or web-based caregiver support services. They comprised mobile social apps, video blogging, video-communication system/video-conferencing, and online social communication, to more advanced techniques such as virtual reality. All of these modalities were shown to be beneficial for improving the social health of individuals. Interventions targeted two aspects of social capital: (1) cognitive social capital, focusing on enhancing trust and control, self-efficacy on life. Some examples were cognitive behavioural therapy, and increasing the received and more importantly perceived social support. (2) structural social capital, focusing on individuals' relationships with family/carers, friends, peers to other connections at the macro level, such as health care providers and their community as a whole. The two interconnected aspects of social capital play a role in decreasing fears of being judged by others, general fears in social interactions and interpersonal problems. Conclusion: Guided digital social support interventions result in open and flexible access to various resources through supportive social networks, for patients and their family members/carers.",10.1177/0020764020963354,wos,Psychiatry,Social capital; digital social capital; social support; social networking,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1177/0020764020963354)
Strengthening the Impact of Digital Cognitive Behavioral Interventions Through a Dual Intervention: Proficient Motivational Interviewing-Based Health Coaching Plus In-Application Techniques,Good,"Serio, C; Gabarda, A; Uyar-Morency, F; Silfee, V; Ludwig, J; Szigethy, E; Butterworth, S",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital tools to support individuals struggling with their mental health. The use of a digital intervention plus human coaching (dual intervention) is gaining momentum in increasing overall engagement in digital cognitive behavioral interventions (dCBIs). However, there is limited insight into the methodologies and coaching models used by those deploying dual interventions. To achieve a deeper understanding, we need to identify and promote effective engagement that leads to clinical outcomes versus simply monitoring engagement metrics. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a collaborative, goal-oriented communication approach that pays particular attention to the language of change and is an effective engagement approach to help people manage mental health issues. However, this approach has been traditionally used for in-person or telephonic interventions, and less is known about the application of MI to digital interventions. Objective: We sought to provide a dual intervention approach and address multiple factors across two levels of engagement to operationalize a dCBI that combined cognitive behavioral therapy-based techniques and MI-based interactions between the digital health coach (DHC) and user. Methods: We reviewed hundreds of digital exchanges between DHCs and users to identify and improve training and quality assurance activities for digital interventions. Results: We tested five hypotheses and found that: (1) users of a dual digital behavioral health intervention had greater engagement levels than users of a noncoached intervention (P<.001); (2) DHCs with a demonstrated competency in applying MI to digital messages had more engaged users, as measured by the DHC-to-user message exchange ratio (P<.001); (3) the DHC-to-user message exchange ratio was correlated with more engagement in app activities (r=0.28, 95% CI 0.23-0.33); (4) DHCs with demonstrated MI proficiency elicited a greater amount of change talk from users than did DHCs without MI proficiency (H=25.12, P<.001); and (5) users who were engaged by DHCs with MI proficiency had better clinical outcomes compared to users engaged by DHCs without MI proficiency (P=.02). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this pilot was the first of its kind to test the application of MI to digital coaching protocols, and it demonstrated the value of MI proficiency in digital health coaching for enhanced engagement and health improvement. Further research is needed to establish coaching models in dCBIs that incorporate MI to promote effective engagement and optimize positive behavioral outcomes.",10.2196/34552,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,digital health; mHealth; cognitive behavioral therapy; motivational interviewing; COVID-19; mental health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/34552)
Stress Prevention@Work: a study protocol for the evaluation of a multifaceted integral stress prevention strategy to prevent employee stress in a healthcare organization: a cluster controlled trial,Good,"Hoek, RJA; Havermans, BM; Houtman, ILD; Brouwers, EPM; Heerkens, YF; Zijlstra-Vlasveld, MC; Anema, JR; van der Beek, AJ; Boot, CRL",BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,2017,"Background: Adequate implementation of work-related stress management interventions can reduce or prevent work-related stress and sick leave in organizations. We developed a multifaceted integral stress-prevention strategy for organizations from several sectors that includes a digital platform and collaborative learning network. The digital platform contains a stepwise protocol to implement work-related stress-management interventions. It includes stress screeners, interventions and intervention providers to facilitate access to and the selection of matching work-related stress-management interventions. The collaborative learning network, including stakeholders from various organizations, plans meetings focussing on an exchange of experiences and good practices among organizations for the implementation of stress prevention measures. This paper describes the design of an integral stress-prevention strategy, Stress Prevention@Work, and the protocol for the evaluation of: 1) the effects of the strategy on perceived stress and work-related outcomes, and 2) the barriers and facilitators for implementation of the strategy. Methods: The effectiveness of Stress Prevention@Work will be evaluated in a cluster controlled trial, in a large healthcare organization in the Netherlands, at six and 12 months. An independent researcher will match teams on working conditions and size and allocate the teams to the intervention or control group. Teams in the intervention group will be offered Stress Prevention@Work. For each intervention team, one employee is responsible for applying the strategy within his/her team using the digital platform and visiting the collaborative learning network. Using a waiting list design, the control group will be given access to the strategy after 12 months. The primary outcome is the employees' perceived stress measured by the stress subscale of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Secondary outcome measures are job demands, job resources and the number of preventive stress measures implemented at the team level. Alongside the trial, a process evaluation, including barriers and facilitators of the implementation of Stress Prevention@Work, will be conducted in one healthcare organisation. Discussion: If Stress Prevention@Work is found to be effective in one healthcare organisation, further implementation on a broader scale might lead to increased productivity and decreased stress and sick leave in other organizations.

Student-Led Stress Reduction Support Groups: A Qualitative Program Evaluation,Good,"Moran, MK; Makic, MBF; Mcgladrey, L; Cook, PF; Peterson, K",JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION,2023,Background: Burnout and attrition in nursing have been accelerated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nursing students experience greater stress than non-nursing students but often lack adequate institutional support to build resiliency. Support groups are an effective strategy for processing stress that are underused in nursing education. An innovative online stress impact course was developed at a college of nursing to address students' stress during the pandemic. The course culminated in a voluntary virtual support group led by a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner graduate student. The aim of this qualitative program evaluation was to determine how graduate nursing students experienced the stress support group. Method: This study used qualitative exploratory analysis of support group reflections from 47 graduate nursing students. Results: Four themes emerged: (1) Making Positive Connections; (2) Leveraging Skills to Manage Stress; (3) Beneficial; and (4) Facing Trauma. Conclusion: Graduate student-led support groups are a feasible and effective strategy to mitigate stress and improve nursing student resiliency.

StudiCare procrastination - Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial of a persuasive design-optimized internet- and mobile-based intervention with digital coach targeting procrastination in college students,Other,"Mutter, A; Küchler, AM; Idrees, AR; Kählke, F; Terhorst, Y; Baumeister, H",BMC PSYCHOLOGY,2023,"BackgroundAcademic procrastination is widespread among college students. Procrastination is strongly negatively correlated with psychological well-being, thus early interventions are needed. Internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) could provide a low-threshold treatment option. Human guidance seems to be a decisive mechanism of change in iCBT. Persuasive design optimization of iCBT and guidance by a digital coach might represent a resource-saving alternative. The study evaluated the non-inferiority of a digital coach in comparison to human guidance with regard to the primary outcome procrastination.MethodsThe iCBT StudiCare procrastination was optimized by principles of the Persuasive System Design (PSD). A total of 233 college students were randomly assigned to either StudiCare procrastination guided by a digital coach (intervention group, IG) or by a human eCoach (control group, CG). All participants were assessed at baseline, 4-, 8- and 12-weeks post-randomization. Symptom change and between-group differences were assessed with latent growth curve models and supported by effect size levels. The non-inferiority margin was set at Cohen's d = - 0.3.ResultsThe primary outcome procrastination measured by the Irrational Procrastination scale (IPS) significantly decreased across groups (? = - 0.79, p < .001, Cohen's d = -0.43 to -0.89) from baseline to 12-weeks post-randomization. There were no significant differences between groups (? = -0.03, p = .84, Cohen's d = -0.03 to 0.08). Regarding symptoms of depression, no significant time x group effect was found (? = 0.26, p = .09; Cohen's d = -0.15 to 0.21). There was also no significant time x group effect on the improvement of symptoms of anxiety (? = 0.25, p = .09). However, Cohen's ds were above the non-inferiority margin 8-weeks (Cohen's d = 0.51) and 12-weeks post-randomization (Cohen's d = 0.37), preferring the CG. Of the IG, 34% and of the CG, 36% completed 80% of the modules.ConclusionsThe PSD optimized version of StudiCare procrastination is effective in reducing procrastination. The digital coach was not inferior to human guidance. Guidance by a digital coach in iCBT against procrastination for college students could be a resource-saving alternative to human guidance.Trial registrationThe trial was registered at the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Trial Register (ID: DRKS00025209, 30/04/2021).",10.1186/s40359-023-01312-1,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,Persuasive System Design; Internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy; Procrastination; Digital guidance,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40359-023-01312-1)
Study Protocol of an App-Based Prevention Program for Perinatal Depression,Other,"Tan, XM; He, YQ; Hua, N; Wiley, J; Sun, M",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,2022,"The prevalence of perinatal depression (PND) in China is continuously rising, and the suicide rate among pregnant women is remarkably high. Preventing the occurrence of PND based on the management of primary health care is of great significance. Improving adherence to intervention programs is a key concern for PND prevention. Thus, a new intervention strategy based on mobile health could bring a new perspective to prevent the occurrence of PND and reduce the sample dropout rate. A single-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized, dynamic, and stratified intervention strategy based on an app. Four health centers will be randomly selected and randomly assigned to an intervention group (two centers) and a control group (two centers). Participants (n = 426) will be enrolled from the four selected health centers, with 213 in each group. The intervention group will receive the interventions personalized by the feature-matching algorithm of the user profile and be reassigned to the low-risk group (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS] < 9) or moderate/high-risk group (9 <= EPDS < 13 and EPDS >= 13, but not meeting the criteria for PND) for intervention based on each EPDS score until 6 months after delivery. The control group will receive the same intervention components of the app but without the dynamic, personalized, and stratified function. Depression status, negative emotion symptoms, parental competence, and sample dropout rate will be measured at different weeks of pregnancy (12-16 [baseline], 24, 37) and at 42 days, 3 months, and 6 months after delivery. Follow-up evaluation (t(6): 12 months after delivery) will also be conducted. If the intervention is effective, it will provide a personalized, time-friendly, and dynamic intervention for preventing PND.

Anxiety and depression are among the most common psychological difficulties. The aim of this study is to evaluate an optimized version of a promising indicated group intervention for emotional problems. The program (EMOTION Coping Kids Managing Anxiety and Depression) targets school children 8-12 years with anxious and depressive symptoms and examines three factors. Factor 1 compares the standard EMOTION intervention delivered in 16 group-based sessions (Group), versus a partially-digital EMOTION intervention (DIGGI) delivered as eight group sessions and eight digital sessions. Both versions use virtual reality technology (VR) to improve behavioral experiments. Factor 2 compares parent participation in a 5-session parent group (high involvement) versus sharing information with parents via a brochure (low involvement). Factor 3 compares the use of a measurement and feedback system (MFS) designed to help group leaders tailor the intervention using feedback from children with no MFS. Methods Using a cluster-randomized factorial design, 40 schools across Norway will be randomized to eight different experimental conditions based on three, two-level factors. To assess internalizing symptoms in children, children and their parents will be given self-report questionnaires pre-, post-, and one year after intervention. Parents also report on demographics, user satisfaction, personal symptoms and perception of family related factors. Teachers report on child symptoms and school functioning. Group leaders and the head of the municipal services report on implementation issues. The primary outcomes are changes in depressive and anxious symptoms.

Noting that most people with dementia live at home, we conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of an app-based individualized music listening intervention for people with dementia in the home care setting. The intervention is delivered by family caregivers.Methods We will recruit N = 130 dyads consisting of one person with dementia living at home and their family caregiver. After a baseline assessment, dyads are randomly assigned by gender to either the intervention or control group. People with dementia in the intervention group listen to individualized music playlists for 20 min every other day for six weeks via the self-developed Individualized Music and Dementia app. The control group receives standard care. All dyads complete paper-and-pencil questionnaires six weeks before the start of the intervention (T0), directly before the intervention (T1), directly after the intervention (T2), and six weeks later (T3). During the intervention period, all caregivers also complete daily ecological momentary assessments via the app. During three home visits, a trained project member will observe the dyads and collect hair samples. After the intervention, semi-structured interviews will be conducted to collect information about participants' experiences with the app and intervention. The primary outcome is the attainment of individual goals established during the baseline assessment. Secondary outcomes are the well-being, physiological stress and quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers; people with dementia's behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, resistance during care, and reactions to the music; caregivers' burden of care, positive aspects of care, and caregiving self-efficacy; and the quality of the caregiver-care recipient interaction.Discussion Our study will assess the extent to which an app-based individualized music listening intervention is feasible and effective for enhancing the well-being and quality of life of people with dementia living at home and their family caregivers.Trial registration German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00025502 and ISRCTN registry ISRCTN68084105, https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN68084105",10.1186/s12888-024-05697-0,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,Non-pharmacological intervention; Receptive music therapy; Alzheimer's disease; Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; Neuropsychiatric symptoms; Quality of life; Family caregivers,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-024-05697-0)
SuRxgWell: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of telemedicine-based digital cognitive behavioral intervention for high anxiety and depression among patients undergoing elective hip and knee arthroplasty surgery,Not mental health,"Kaynar, AM; Lin, CR; Sanchez, AG; Lavage, DR; Monroe, A; Zharichenko, N; Strassburger, M; Saucier, K; Groff, YJ; Klatt, BA; O'Malley, MJ; Szigethy, E; Wasan, AD; Chelly, JE",TRIALS,2023,"BackgroundMood disorders (anxiety, depression), sleep disorders, and catastrophizing lead to increased post-operative pain perception, increase in postoperative opioid consumption, decreased engagement with physical activity, and increased resource utilization in surgical patients. Psychosocial disorders significantly affect postoperative outcome. Unfortunately, studies focused on perioperative psychological assessment and treatment are scarce. We propose to test whether digital cognitive behavioral intervention (dCBI) can help surgical patients. dCBI such as RxWell (TM) is a proven treatment for mood disorders in medical patients such as reducing depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We hypothesize that RxWell (TM) will also be effective in surgical patients. This study aims to test whether RxWell (TM) can improve preoperative mood disorders and subsequently reduce postoperative pain and opioid requirement in patients scheduled for primary total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA, TKA). We named the trial as the SuRxgWell trial.MethodsThis is a randomized, controlled trial that will enroll primary and unilateral THA or TKA patients with anxiety and/or depression symptoms before surgery to receive the SuRxgWell dCBI program and investigate its impact on postoperative outcomes including postoperative pain, anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and catastrophizing. After signing an informed consent, subjects will be screened using the PROMIS questionnaires, and subjects with a T-score of >= 60 on the short Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 4a Anxiety and/or short PROMIS 4a Depression questionnaires will be randomized to either usual care (control group) or the cognitive behavioral intervention, RxWell (TM), plus usual care (intervention group). The control group will receive information on how to locate tools to address anxiety and depression, whereas the intervention group will have access to SuRxgWell 1 month prior to surgery and up to 3 months after surgery. The allocation will be 3:1 (intervention to control). Investigators will be blinded, but research coordinators approaching patients and research subjects will not.The primary outcome will be day of surgery anxiety or depression symptoms measured with the PROMIS Short Form v1.0 -Anxiety 4a/Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Measure (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Secondary end points include measuring other health-related quality of life outcomes including sleep disturbance, fatigue, ability to participate in social roles, pain interference, cognitive function, pain catastrophizing, and physical function. Other secondary outcomes include collecting data about preoperative and postoperative pain scores, and pain medication usage, and orthopedic functional recovery at baseline, day of surgery, and 1, 2, and 3 months after the surgery with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Hip injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS). In addition, subjects will be asked to complete a GAD-7 and PHQ-8 questionnaires bi-weekly (via the RxWell (TM) app for the interventional group or REDCAP for the control group). Data about postsurgical complications, and resource utilization will also be recorded.

"Supervised team management, with or without structured psychotherapy, in heavy users of a mental health service with borderline personality disorder: a two-year follow-up preliminary randomized study",Good,"Amianto, F; Ferrero, A; Pierò, A; Cairo, E; Rocca, G; Simonelli, B; Fassina, S; Abbate-Daga, G; Fassino, S",BMC PSYCHIATRY,2011,"Background: Individuals affected by severe Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are often heavy users of Mental Health Services (MHS). Short-term treatments currently used in BPD therapy are useful to target disruptive behaviors but they are less effective in reducing heavy MHS use. Therefore, alternative short-term treatments, less complex than long-term psychodynamic psychotherapies but specifically oriented to BPD core problems, need to be developed to reduce MHS overuse. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adding Sequential Brief Adlerian Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (SB-APP) to Supervised Team Management (STM) in BPD treatment compared to STM alone in a naturalistic group of heavy MHS users with BPD. Effectiveness was evaluated 6 times along a two-year follow-up. Methods: Thirty-five outpatients who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (STM = 17; SB-APP = 18) and then compared. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and CGI-modified (CGI-M) for BPD, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), and Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R) were administered at T1, T3, T6, T12, T18 and T24. At T12 the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form (WAI-S) was also completed. At the one-year follow-up, SB-APP group did not receive any additional individual psychological support. MHS team was specifically trained in BPD treatment and had regular supervisions. Results: All patients improved on CGI, GAF, and STAXI scores after 6 and 12 months, independently of treatment received. SB-APP group showed better outcome on impulsivity, suicide attempts, chronic feelings of emptiness, and disturbed relationships. We found a good stabilization at the one year follow-up, even after the interruption of brief psychotherapy in the SB-APP group. Conclusions: Although STM for BPD applied to heavy MHS users was effective in reducing symptoms and improving their global functioning, adding a time-limited and focused psychotherapy was found to achieve a better outcome. In particular, focusing treatment on patients' personality with a specific psychotherapeutic approach (i.e. SB-APP) seemed to be more effective than STM alone.",10.1186/1471-244X-11-181,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/1471-244X-11-181)

Supporting People Who Have Lost a Close Person by Bereavement or Separation: Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Two French-Language Internet-Based Interventions,Other,"Debrot, A; Kheyar, M; Efinger, L; Berthoud, L; Pomini, V",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2022,"Background: Internet-based interventions (IBIs) are as efficient as face-to-face psychotherapy for a variety of mental health disorders, including complicated grief. Most evidence stems from guided IBIs. However, recent research indicates that the benefit of guidance is lower in more interactive IBIs. As such, providing guidance only to people requiring it (guidance on demand) appears a cost-effective solution. This is particularly important to develop given the recent rise in grief symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents the protocol of a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and adherence rate of 2 IBIs for grief-related symptoms after the loss a close one following death or romantic separation, using a guidance on demand framework. LIVIA 2.0 was developed based on theoretical and empirical findings on grief processes and IBIs, and it will be compared to LIVIA 1 that has already demonstrated its efficacy. Objective: Our main hypotheses are that LIVIA 1 (control condition) and LIVIA 2.0 (experimental condition) increase participants' well-being and decrease their distress at posttest and at follow-up, that LIVIA 2.0 is more efficient than LIVIA 1 for all outcomes, and that LIVIA 2.0 has less dropouts than LIVIA 1. Methods: Outcomes will be assessed at pretest, posttest (12 weeks later), and follow-up (24 weeks later). We will recruit 234 participants through a variety of means, including social media and contacts with the press. Primary outcomes are grief symptoms, depressive symptoms, and eudemonic well-being. Secondary outcomes are anxiety symptoms, grief coping strategies, aspects related to self-identity reorganization, and program satisfaction. LIVIA 2.0 participants will additionally undergo a weekly mood and grief symptom monitoring, allowing us to explore the short-term efficacy of the sessions. Results: The creation and development of the content of LIVIA 2.0 was completed during the first phase of the project. Participant recruitment will begin in May 2022 and will last until January 2023. Conclusions: This study will emphasize the relevance of the innovations included in LIVIA 2.0 regarding the efficacy and dropout rate of IBIs for grief symptoms and will allow investigations on how these changes impact the demand for guidance.

Supporting population mental health and wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: protocol for a sequential mixed-method study,Other,"Risling, T; Carlberg, C; Kassam, I; Moss, T; Janssen, P; Iduye, S; Strudwick, G",BMJ OPEN,2021,"Introduction The global COVID-19 pandemic has reported to have a negative impact on the mental health and well-being of individuals around the world. Mental health system infrastructure, primarily developed to support individuals through in-person care, struggled to meet rising demand for services even prior to COVID-19. With public health guidelines requiring the use of physical distancing during the pandemic, digital mental health supports may be one way to address the needs of the population. Despite this, barriers exist in promoting and supporting access to existing and emerging digital resources. Text messaging may address some of these barriers, extending the potential reach of these digital interventions across divides that may separate some vulnerable or disadvantaged groups from essential mental health supports. Building on an existing knowledge synthesis project identifying key digital resources for improved mental health, this research will establish low-tech connections to assess need and better match access to services for those who need it most. The aim of this study is to codesign a customised two-way texting service to explore need and better align access to mental health supports for Canadians located in Saskatchewan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and analysis This study will be completed in Saskatchewan, Canada. For this project, the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework will be used to support three phases of a sequential mixed-method study. An advisory committee of Saskatchewan residents will guide this work with the study team. A 10-week service will be launched to connect individuals with appropriately suited digital mental health interventions through the use of text messaging. In phase 1, implementation and prototyping will be conducted with collaborative codesign for key elements related to features of an enrolment survey and initial messaging content. Phase 2 will focus on advancing the effectiveness of the service using quantitative user data. In phase 3, an embedding approach will be used to integrate both qualitative and quantitative data collected to understand the overall acceptability, satisfaction and perceived benefit of the text messaging service. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics will be used as analytic methods.

Exercise programs and other interventions following surgery can facilitate the recovery process. With limited clinician contact time, patients with TKR have a substantial burden of self-management and limited communication with their care team, thus often fail to implement an effective rehabilitation plan. Objective: We have developed a digital orthopedic rehabilitation platform that comprises a mobile phone app, wearable activity tracker, and clinical Web portal in order to engage patients with self-management tasks for surgical preparation and recovery, thus addressing the challenges of adherence to and completion of TKR rehabilitation. The study will determine the efficacy of the TKR platform in delivering information and assistance to patients in their preparation and recovery from TKR surgery and a Web portal for clinician care teams (ie, surgeons and physiotherapists) to remotely support and monitor patient progress. Methods: The study will evaluate the TKR platform through a randomized controlled trial conducted at multiple sites (N= 5) in a number of states in Australia with 320 patients undergoing TKR surgery; the trial will run for 13 months for each patient. Participants will be randomized to either a control group or an intervention group, both receiving usual care as provided by their hospital. The intervention group will receive the app and wearable activity tracker. Participants will be assessed at 4 different time points: 4 weeks before surgery, immediately before surgery, 12 weeks after surgery, and 52 weeks after surgery. The primary outcome measure is the Oxford Knee Score. Secondary outcome measures include quality of life (Short-Form Health Survey); depression, anxiety, and stress (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales); self-motivation; self-determination; self-efficacy; and the level of satisfaction with the knee surgery and care delivery. The study will also collect quantitative usage data related to all components (app, activity tracker, and Web portal) of the TKR platform and qualitative data on the perceptions of the platform as a tool for patients, carers, and clinicians. Finally, an economic evaluation of the impact of the platform will be conducted. Results: Development of the TKR platform has been completed and deployed for trial. The research protocol is approved by 2 human research ethics committees in Australia. A total of 5 hospitals in Australia (2 in New South Wales, 2 in Queensland, and 1 in South Australia) are expected to participate in the trial. Conclusions: The TKR platform is designed to provide flexibility in care delivery and increased engagement with rehabilitation services.

Synergizing the Behavior Change Wheel and a Cocreative Approach to Design a Physical Activity Intervention for Adolescents and Young Adults With Intellectual Disabilities: Development Study,Other,"Maenhout, L; Latomme, J; Cardon, G; Crombez, G; Van Hove, G; Compernolle, S",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2024,"Background: There is a need for physical activity promotion interventions in adolescents and young adults with intellectual disabilities. Current interventions have shown limited effectiveness, which may be attributed to the absence of theory and a population-specific development. Combining a planning model (including theory) and cocreation with the target audience during intervention development could potentially address this gap. Objective: This study aimed to report the systematic development of the Move it, Move ID! intervention by describing how the 8 different steps of the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) were applied and present the results that emerged from those steps. In doing so, the (theoretical) content of the intervention is described in detail. Methods: A total of 23 adolescents and young adults (aged 14-22 years) with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities were designated as cocreators of the intervention. Across 2 groups, 6 similar cocreation sessions were organized in each. The content and sequence of the sessions were structured to align with the 8 steps of the BCW. All sessions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Both a deductive (ie, steps of the BCW) and inductive (ie, resonating the voice of the participants) analysis approach were applied specifically focusing on identifying and describing the findings within each of the BCW steps. Results: After behavioral analysis (steps 1-4), 10 intervention goals were chosen and linked to Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation-Behavior components (theory within the BCW) that needed to be addressed. Psychological capability, social opportunity, and reflective motivation were emphasized as the first targets to focus on. A key finding was the urge for real-life social connectedness and social integration, which makes the social component as part of physical activity a central theme to focus on within intervention development. Judgments on the most suitable intervention functions (step 5) and behavior change techniques (step 7) were explained. When discussing the mode of delivery of the intervention (step 8), it was underscored that solely relying on a mobile health app would not fulfill participants' social needs. Hence, the chosen intervention adopts a dyadic approach in which young individuals with intellectual disabilities are matched with peers without intellectual disabilities to engage in physical activities together, with a mobile app playing a supportive role in this partnership. Conclusions: The transparent description of the development process highlights why certain intervention components and behavior change techniques were chosen and how they are intertwined by means of the selected intervention design. This paper provides a detailed blueprint for practitioners wanting to integrate the BCW and its associated behavior change techniques, in combination with actively involving the target group, into their intervention development for people with intellectual disabilities.",10.2196/51693,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,Behavior Change Wheel; cocreation; intervention; physical activity; adolescents; young adults; intellectual disabilities,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/51693)

Prehabilitation involves the active preparation of patients prior to surgery, including support to tackle risk behaviours that mediate and undermine physical and mental health and wellbeing. The majority of prehabilitation interventions are delivered in person, however many patients express a preference for remotely-delivered interventions that provide them with tailored support and the flexibility. Digital prehabilitation interventions offer scalability and have the potential to benefit perioperative healthcare systems, however there is a lack of robustly developed and evaluated digital programmes for use in routine clinical care. We aim to systematically develop and test the feasibility of an evidence and theory-informed multibehavioural digital prehabilitation intervention 'iPREPWELL' designed to prepare patients for major surgery. The intervention will be developed with reference to the Behaviour Change Wheel, COM-B model, and the Theoretical Domains Framework.

Women entering treatment present with more severe AUD and more complex psychological, social, and service needs than men. Treatment program elements that may reduce barriers to AUD treatment include provision of childcare, prenatal care, treatment for co-occurring psychological problems, and supplemental social services. Research has suggested that outcomes for women are best when treatment is provided in women-only programs that include female-specific content. To date, research on treatments tailored to the individual needs of women is limited, but research on mechanisms of change has suggested the importance of targeting anxiety and depression, affiliative statements in treatment, abstinence self-efficacy, coping skills, autonomy, and social support for abstinence. Future research should focus on early interventions, linkages between primary care or mental health clinics and AUD treatment settings, and integrated treatments for co- occurring AUD and other disorders.

Participants were 117 fifth-grade students who were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1:1 (i.e., each student had one tablet) and Group 1:m (i.e., each group shared one tablet) to learn the topic of triboelectrification. The results demonstrated that the students with a 1:m TSR performed better than those with a 1:1 TSR in terms of group work; that students with a 1:m TSR showed a higher degree of involvement during collaborative inquiries; and that the retention test, cognitive load, and group-process satisfaction results showed no significant difference between the two conditions. The findings indicate that the positive effect of collaboration on individuals may gradually disappear and the tradeoff between TSR and time of intervention should be considered during instruction.",10.1080/15391523.2021.2015018,wos,Education & Educational Research,Mobile learning; virtual manipulative; CSCL; cognitive load; task involvement; inquiry learning,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/15391523.2021.2015018)
Teaching Cancer Patients the Value of Correct Positioning During Radiotherapy Using Visual Aids and Practical Exercises,Not mental health,"Hansen, H; Nielsen, BK; Boejen, A; Vestergaard, A",JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION,2018,"The aim of this study was to investigate if teaching patients about positioning before radiotherapy treatment would (a) reduce the residual rotational set-up errors, (b) reduce the number of repositionings and (c) improve patients' sense of control by increasing self-efficacy and reducing distress. Patients were randomized to either standard care (control group) or standard care and a teaching session combining visual aids and practical exercises (intervention group). Daily images from the treatment sessions were evaluated off-line. Both groups filled in a questionnaire before and at the end of the treatment course on various aspects of cooperation with the staff regarding positioning. Comparisons of residual rotational set-up errors showed an improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group. No significant differences were found in number of repositionings, self-efficacy or distress. Results show that it is possible to teach patients about positioning and thereby improve precision in positioning.

Teaching and Developing Social and Emotional Skills with Technology,Not Multi User,"Slovák, P; Fitzpatrick, G",ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION,2015,"Supporting social interactions is a long-term focus for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). However, understanding how social and emotional skills are learned, and how this process can be supported by technology, is an important but underresearched area in HCI so far. To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education-such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice-and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far. We also highlight how the focus on supporting SEL would bring novel opportunities and challenges for HCI, as well as provide a basis for a strong HCI research agenda in this space.",10.1145/2744195,wos,Computer Science,Review; social emotional learning; SEL; technology supported learning; child development; education; empathy; reflection; emotional intelligence; soft skills; behavior change,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1145/2744195)

The current study explored the effects of a short-term digital group intervention aimed at providing cognitive behavioral and mindfulness tools and skills to reduce loneliness and depression and to increase social support among older adults in Israel. This pilot randomized controlled trial included community-dwelling older adults (n = 82; aged between 65-90 years; 80% female) who were randomized either to an intervention group (n = 64) or a wait-list control group (n = 18). The intervention included seven online sessions, over 3.5 weeks. Depression, loneliness, and social support measures were administered at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 1-month follow-up. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed statistically and clinically significant reductions in depression in the intervention group, with results maintained at one-month follow-up. Loneliness levels also significantly decreased post-intervention; however, this benefit was not maintained at one-month follow-up. Social support slightly increased both post-intervention and 1-month follow-up-but these changes were not statistically significant. There were no overall changes for the wait-list control group. Our intervention provided promising evidence regarding the effectiveness of an online group intervention to alleviate mental health effects and to promote the coping of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.

One such complex clinical environment is managing a trauma patient. Despite the significant developments in managing these patients, foundation doctors are frequently highly anxious due to their limited knowledge and experience. The aim of this project was twofold; to improve foundation doctor performance of managing trauma patients and to reduce their associated anxiety, through the use of VR teaching. Methods A total of 14 foundation doctors were divided into two groups. One group underwent departmental teaching. The second group underwent departmental teaching and VR FIIT. We assessed the doctors via two methods. First, time taken to complete tasks correctly in trauma simulations was compared. Second, the doctors completed a self-reported level-based assessment questionnaire regarding anxiety and stress around trauma calls. Results The VR FIIT intervention group were able to complete each task on average 118s faster than the standard group. The standard group missed essential tasks such as C-spine immobilisation. The VR FIIT group self-reported significantly lower levels of anxiety related to trauma calls.

Team leader strategies for enabling collaboration technology adaptation: team technology knowledge to improve globally distributed systems development work,Not mental health,"Thomas, DM; Bostrom, RP",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS,2010,"Active management of team adaptation of collaboration technologies offers an important lever for influencing success rates in distributed project work, particularly in settings characterized by high task interdependence, such as information systems development (ISD). Substantial uncertainty exists as to how a leader might influence such technology adaptation during project work. Prior research indicates that a major leader resource to accomplish technology adaptation in these settings would be team technology knowledge (TTK). This empirical field study develops a five-factor model of strategies regarding awareness of TTK that team leaders take in intervening to affect technology adaptation in distributed ISD projects. The analysis indicates insights into when and why these strategies are effective and how they relate to each other as well as the leader's awareness of TTK. The study provides a way for ISD team leaders to approach improving team collaboration from a socio-technical perspective as well as insights into potential levers for improving team technology adaptation and the efficacy of ISD projects.

Three research questions are explored. (1) What opportunities exist for organizations investing in technology as a talent management strategy for recruiting early career talent? (2) What are the risks or threats to organizations from investing in technology as a strategy for recruiting early career talent? (3) What role do meso-level actors play in recruiting early career talent? More specifically, to what extent do the views of graduate recruiters and career advisors as agents of organizations and higher education institutions align or diverge? Thirty-six semi-structured interviews were conducted with graduate recruiters and career advisors. Thematic analysis was subsequently applied, identifying three themes (i) employer branding, (ii) virtual recruitment, and (iii) diversity and social inclusion agendas, each presented opportunities and risks. The theoretical contribution comes from advancing career ecosystems and the new psychological contract as a theoretical framework by focusing on technological transformation and capturing the dyadic relationship between the meso-level actors. Our paper integrates three topic clusters of HRD interventions and outcomes, national HRD, and career development, while manifesting the role and importance of under-represented career actors. Practical implications aim to help shape talent management strategies for recruiting early career talent.

However, adjustment among older people and in synchronous group interventions is more challenging. Technology affordance concerns the possibilities engendered by technology for various users and purposes and can help understand challenges in ICT-delivered groups and identify possible solutions. Research Design and Methods Adopting a multiple triangulation approach, we observed ICT-delivered groups of acceptance and commitment therapy and exercise for older people with depressive symptoms, conducted focus groups with older people who had received group psychotherapy with or without an exercise component, and obtained clinical notes from interventionists. We conducted a thematic analysis of the observation notes, focus group transcriptions, and clinical notes. Results Four focus groups were conducted with 22 participants (mean age = 72.6 years, standard deviation = 7.2, 86% female). We identified 3 challenges: (1) seeing-be seen dilemma, (2) speaking-hearing dilemma, and (3) blurred therapy-home boundary, and 2 solutions: (1) maneuvering layouts and collaborative tools, and (2) cross-platform mediated strategies. Participants struggled to observe the interventionist while simultaneously demonstrating their posture in front of a camera. Remaining silent and moderated turn-taking allowed for clearer hearing but limited interactions. Interruptions from the background environment and intersections of family living spaces disrupted audio-visual communication and jeopardized the sense of security. As a solution, interventionists maneuvered layouts and collaborative tools on teleconferencing applications to achieve intervention goals and provided support through different media. Discussion and Implications The identified challenges and potential solutions can be understood from interactivity, portability, temporality, persistence, and multimediality. Technology affordance can guide ICT-delivered group design by matching the affordance of various technologies and communication media with the characteristics of the intervention and users to enhance efficacy and avoid an unnecessary digital divide.",10.1093/geroni/igad063,"pubmed, wos",Geriatrics & Gerontology,Chronic pain; Cross-platform; Telehealth; Telemental health; Teletherapy,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igad063)

A secondary aim was to estimate the application's effect in reducing caregiver burden and behavioral and psychological symptoms related to dementia (BPSD).MethodsPatient-caregiver dyads (n = 53) were recruited and randomized to intervention and control groups. Assessment of usability, acceptance, BPSD symptoms, and caregiver burden were collected at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up.ResultsThe enrollment rate was acceptable despite pandemic related challenges (53/60 target recruitment sample). Among randomized individuals, there was a retention rate of 85% and data completion was attained for 81.5% of those allocated to usual care and 88.5% of those allocated to Brain CareNotes. Mean caregiver-reported app usability at 6 months was 72.5 (IQR 70.0-90.0) on the System Usability Scale-considered Good to Excellent-and user acceptance was reasonable as indicated by 85%-90% of caregivers reporting they would intend to use the app to some degree in the next 6 months, if able.

Design and Methods: The effects of training and technology on MI is part of a larger comparative effectiveness, cluster randomized trial. Twenty-four SBHCs in six states received virtual training on MI. Half the sites received HeartSmartKids(TM), a bilingual (English/Spanish), decision-support technology. The technology generated tailored patient education materials. Standard growth charts were plotted and health risks were highlighted to support MI counseling. The results of the MI training included provider satisfaction with MI training and parent assessment of the components of MI in their child's care. Providers and parents were surveyed at baseline, after training, and six months after training. Results: Providers were satisfied with training and reported improvements in counseling proficiency (p < 0.0007) and psychological/emotional assessment (p=0.0004) after training. Parents in the technology group reported significant improvement in provider support for healthy eating (p=0.04). Conclusion: Virtual training has the potential of preparing providers to use MI to address childhood obesity. Technology improved parent support for healthy eating. Future research should evaluate the impact of technology to support MI on patient outcomes. Practice Implications: Childhood obesity guidelines emphasize that MI should be used to promote healthy weight in children. Training providers on MI may help more providers incorporate obesity guidelines in their practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This disruption puts patients with T2D at risk for poor diabetes outcomes, especially those who experience social disadvantage due to socioeconomic class, rurality, or ethnicity. The appropriate use of communication technology could reduce these gaps in diabetes care created by the pandemic and also provide support for psychological distress. Objective: The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of an innovative co-designed Technology-Enabled Collaborative Care (TECC) model for diabetes management and mental health support among adults with T2D. Methods: We will recruit 30 adults with T2D residing in Ontario, Canada, to participate in our sequential explanatory mixed methods study. They will participate in 8 weekly web-based health coaching sessions with a registered nurse, who is a certified diabetes educator, who will be supported by a digital care team (ie, a peer mentor, an addictions specialist, a dietitian, a psychiatrist, and a psychotherapist). Assessments will be completed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, with a 12-week follow-up. Our primary outcome is the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, as evident by the participant recruitment and retention rates. Key secondary outcomes include assessment completion and delivery of the intervention. Exploratory outcomes consist of changes in mental health, substance use, and physical health behaviors. Stakeholder experience and satisfaction will be explored through a qualitative descriptive study using one-on-one interviews. Results: This paper describes the protocol of the study.

The aim of this systematic review and preliminary meta-analysis was to summarize all the available information about technology-supported psychological treatments for Adjustment Disorder (AjD) patients of all ages. Method: Eligibility criteria included studies that tested a technology-supported treatment in patients with AjD and reported data on a mental health outcome. Case studies and case series were excluded. Searches were conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0. tool for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and the NHLBI tool for pre-post studies. Results: Nine articles (8 RCTs and 1 pre-post study) were included, eight that tested computerised interventions and two that used virtual reality. The meta-analysis showed the superior efficacy of the intervention groups compared to control conditions in reducing mental health symptomatology and a significant improvement be-tween pre-and post-treatment. Limitations: The small number of studies included and the high heterogeneity among them were two of the main limitations. Conclusions: These results are similar to those observed in previous systematic reviews on technology-supported treatments for other mental disorders and suggest that these interventions could be effective for patients with AjD.

Objective: We aimed to provide an updated systematic review on the efficacy of tele-rehabilitation interventions for recovery from motor, higher cortical dysfunction, and poststroke depression among stroke survivors. Methods: We searched PubMed and Cochrane library from January 1, 1980 to July 15, 2017 using the following keywords: Telerehabilitation stroke, Mobile health rehabilitation, Telemedicine stroke rehabilitation, and Telerehabilitation. Our inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials, pilot trials, or feasibility trials that included an intervention group that received any tele-rehabilitation therapy for stroke survivors compared with a control group on usual or standard of care. Results: This search yielded 49 abstracts. By consensus between 2 investigators, 22 publications met the criteria for inclusion and further review. Tele-rehabilitation interventions focused on motor recovery (n = 18), depression, or caregiver strain (n = 2) and higher cortical dysfunction (n = 2).

Telehealth Interventions Delivering Home-based Support Group Videoconferencing: Systematic Review,Good,"Banbury, A; Nancarrow, S; Dart, J; Gray, L; Parkinson, L",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2018,"Background: Group therapy and education and support sessions are used within health care across a range of disciplines such as chronic disease self-management and psychotherapy interventions. However, there are barriers that constrain group attendance, such as mobility, time, and distance. Using videoconferencing may overcome known barriers and improve the accessibility of group-based interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to review the literature to determine the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and implementation of health professional-led group videoconferencing to provide education or social support or both, into the home setting. Methods: Electronic databases were searched using predefined search terms for primary interventions for patient education and/or social support. The quality of studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We developed an analysis framework using hierarchical terms feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and implementation, which were informed by subheadings. Results: Of the 1634 records identified, 17 were included in this review. Home-based groups by videoconferencing are feasible even for those with limited digital literacy. Overall acceptability was high with access from the home highly valued and little concern of privacy issues. Some participants reported preferring face-to-face groups. Good information technology (IT) support and training is required for facilitators and participants. Communication can be adapted for the Web environment and would be enhanced by clear communication strategies and protocols. A range of improved outcomes were reported but because of the heterogeneity of studies, comparison of these across studies was not possible. There was a trend for improvement in mental health outcomes. Benefits highlighted in the qualitative data included engaging with others with similar problems; improved accessibility to groups; and development of health knowledge, insights, and skills. Videoconference groups were able to replicate group processes such as bonding and cohesiveness. Similar outcomes were reported for those comparing face-to-face groups and videoconference groups. Conclusions: Groups delivered by videoconference are feasible and potentially can improve the accessibility of group interventions. This may be particularly useful for those who live in rural areas, have limited mobility, are socially isolated, or fear meeting new people.

Telehealth Interventions for HIV in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,Good,"Phan, JM; Kim, S; Linh, DTT; Cosimi, LA; Pollack, TM",CURRENT HIV/AIDS REPORTS,2022,"Purpose of review This review summarizes technology-based interventions for HIV in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We highlight potential benefits and challenges to using telehealth in LMICs and propose areas for future study. Recent findings We identified several models for using telehealth to expand HIV health care access in LMICs, including telemedicine visits for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) services, telementoring programs for providers, and virtual peer-support groups. Emerging data support the acceptability and feasibility of these strategies. However, further investigations are needed to determine whether these models are scalable and sustainable in the face of barriers related to cost, infrastructure, and regulatory approval. HIV telehealth interventions may be a valuable approach to addressing gaps along the HIV care cascade in LMICs. Future studies should focus on strategies for expanding existing programs to scale and for assessing long-term clinical outcomes.",10.1007/s11904-022-00630-0,wos,Infectious Diseases,Telehealth; HIV; Low- and middle-income countries; Technology; Telemedicine; Pre-exposure prophylaxis,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11904-022-00630-0)
Telehealth Treatment of Patients in an Intensive Acute Care Psychiatric Setting During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Comparative Safety and Effectiveness to In-Person Treatment,Good,"Zimmerman, M; Terrill, D; Avanzato, CD; Tirpak, JW",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY,2021,"Background: Most research evaluating telehealth psychiatric treatment has been conducted in outpatient settings. There is a great lack of research assessing the efficacy of telehealth treatment in more acute, intensive treatment settings such as a partial hospital. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of behavioral health treatment has transitioned to a virtual format. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we examined the effectiveness of our partial hospital program (PHP). Method: The sample included 207 patients who were treated virtually from May 2020 to September 2020 and a comparison group of 207 patients who were treated in the in-person partial program a year earlier. Patients completed self-administered measures of patient satisfaction, symptoms, coping ability, functioning, and general well-being. Results: For both the in-person and telehealth methods of delivering partial hospital level of care, patients were highly satisfied with treatment and reported a significant reduction in symptoms and suicidality from admission to discharge. On the modified Remission from Depression Questionnaire, the primary outcome measure, both groups reported a significant (P <.01) improvement in functioning, coping ability, positive mental health, and general well-being. A large effect size of treatment (Cohen d > 0.8) was found in both treatment groups. The only significant difference in outcome between the patients treated in the different formats was a greater length of stay (mean +/- SD of 13.5 +/- 8.1 vs 8.5 +/- 5.0 days, t = 7.61, P <.001) and greater likelihood of staying in treatment until completion (72.9% vs 62.3%,.2 = 5.34, P <.05) in the virtually treated patients. Conclusions: Telehealth partial hospital treatment was as effective as in-person treatment in terms of patient satisfaction, symptom reduction, suicidal ideation reduction, and improved functioning and well-being. The treatment completion rate was higher in the telehealth cohort, and several patients who were treated virtually commented that they never would have presented for in-person treatment even if there was no pandemic. Telehealth PHPs should be considered a viable treatment option even after the pandemic has resolved.",10.4088/JCP.20m13815,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Psychiatry,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.4088/JCP.20m13815)
Telehealth and In-Person Behavioral Health Services in Rural Communities Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multisite Prospective Cohort Study,Not Multi User,"Ward, MM; Ullrich, F; Bhagianadh, D; Nelson, EL; Marcin, JP; Carter, K; Law, KB; Mccord, C; Neufeld, J; Merchant, KAS",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2023,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered widespread adjustments across the US health care system. Telehealth use showed a substantial increase in mental health conditions and services due to acute public health emergency (PHE) behavioral health needs on top of long-standing gaps in access to behavioral health services. How health systems that were already providing behavioral telehealth services adjusted services and staffing during this period has not been well documented, particularly in rural areas with chronic shortages of behavioral health providers and services.Objective: This study investigates patient and treatment characteristic changes from before the COVID-19 PHE to during the PHE within both telehealth and in-person behavioral health services provided in 95 rural communities across the United States.Methods: We used a nonrandomized, prospective, multisite research design involving 2 active treatment groups. The telehealth cohort included all patients who initiated telehealth treatment regimens during the data collection period. A comparison group included a cohort of patients who initiated in-person treatment regimen. Patient enrollment occurred on a rolling basis, and data collection was extended for 3 months after treatment initiation for each patient. Chi-square tests compared changes from pre-PHE to PHE time periods within telehealth and in-person treatment cohorts. The dependent measures included patient diagnosis, clinicians providing treatment services, and type of treatment services provided at each encounter. The 4780 patients in the telehealth cohort and the 6457 patients in the in-person cohort had an average of 3.5 encounters during the 3-month follow-up period.Results: The encounters involving anxiety, dissociative, and stress-related disorders in the telehealth cohort increased from 30% (698/2352) in the pre-PHE period to 35% (4632/12,853) in the PHE period (P<.001), and encounters involving substance use disorders in the in-person cohort increased from 11% (468/4249) in the pre-PHE period to 18% (3048/17,047) in the PHE period (P<.001). The encounters involving treatment service codes for alcohol, drug, and medication-assisted therapy in the telehealth cohort increased from 1% (22/2352) in the pre-PHE period to 11% (1470/13,387) in the PHE period (P<.001); likewise, encounters for this type of service in the in-person cohort increased from 0% (0/4249) in the pre-PHE period to 16% (2687/17,047) in the PHE period (P<.001). From the pre-PHE to the PHE period, encounters involving 60-minute psychotherapy in the telehealth cohort increased from 8% (190/2352) to 14% (1802/13,387; P<.001), while encounters involving group therapy in the in-person cohort decreased from 12% (502/4249) to 4% (739/17,047; P<.001). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic challenged health service providers, and they adjusted the way both telehealth and in-person behavioral therapy services were delivered. Looking forward, future research is needed to explicate the interaction of patient, provider, setting, and intervention factors that influenced the patterns observed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",10.2196/47047,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,anxiety; behavior; behavioral health; COVID-19; depression; digital health; eHealth; mental health; mHealth; pandemic; rural health services; rural; telehealth; telemedicine,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/47047)
"Telehealth treatment of patients with major depressive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic: Comparative safety, patient satisfaction, and effectiveness to prepandemic in-person treatment",Good,"Zimmerman, M; D'Avanzato, C; King, BT",JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,2023,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic impelled a transition from in-person to telehealth psychiatric treatment. There are no studies of partial hospital telehealth treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we compared the effectiveness of partial hospital care of patients with MDD treated virtually versus in-person.Methods: Outcome was compared in 294 patients who were treated virtually from May 2020 to December 2021 to 542 patients who were treated in the in-person partial program in the 2 years prior to the pandemic. Patients completed self-administered measures of patient satisfaction, symptoms, coping ability, functioning, and general well-being.Results: In both the in-person and telehealth groups, patients with MDD were highly satisfied with treatment and reported a significant reduction in symptoms from admission to discharge. Both groups also reported a significant improvement in positive mental health, general well-being, coping ability, and functioning. A large effect size of treatment was found in both treatment groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, the small differences in outcome favored the telehealth-treated patients. The length of stay and the likelihood of staying in treatment until completion were significantly greater in the virtually treated patients. Limitations: The treatment groups were ascertained sequentially, and telehealth treatment was initiated after the COVID-19 pandemic began. Outcome assessment was limited to a self-administered questionnaire.Conclusions: In an intensive acute care setting, delivering treatment to patients with MDD using a virtual, tele-health platform was as effective as treating patients in-person.",10.1016/j.jad.2022.12.015,"pubmed, wos",Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,Depression; Treatment; Telehealth; Virtual; Partial hospital,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.12.015)
Telehealth-Supported Decision-making Psychiatric Care for Suicidal Ideation: Longitudinal Observational Study,Other,"O'Callaghan, E; Mahrer, N; Belanger, HG; Sullivan, S; Lee, C; Gupta, CT; Winsberg, M",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, and suicidal ideation (SI) is a significant precursor and risk factor for suicide. Objective: This study aimed to examine the impact of a telepsychiatric care platform on changes in SI over time and remission, as well as to investigate the relationship between various demographic and medical factors on SI and SI remission. Methods: Participants included 8581 US-based adults (8366 in the treatment group and 215 in the control group) seeking treatment for depression, anxiety, or both. The treatment group included patients who had completed at least 12 weeks of treatment and had received a prescription for at least one psychiatric medication during the study period. Providers prescribed psychiatric medications for each patient during their first session and received regular data on participants. They also received decision support at treatment onset via the digital platform, which leveraged an empirically derived proprietary precision-prescribing algorithm to give providers real-time care guidelines. Participants in the control group consisted of individuals who completed the initial enrollment data and completed surveys at baseline and 12 weeks but did not receive care. Results: Greater feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia, and feeling bad about oneself were most significantly correlated (r=0.24-0.37) with SI at baseline. Sleep issues and feeling tired or having low energy, although significant, had lower correlations with SI (r=0.13-0.14). In terms of demographic variables, advancing age and education were associated with less SI at baseline (r=-0.16) and 12 weeks (r=-0.10) but less improvement over time (r=-0.12 and -0.11, respectively). Although not different at baseline, the SI expression was evident in 34.4% (74/215) of the participants in the control group and 12.32% (1031/8366) of the participants in the treatment group at 12 weeks. Although the participants in the treatment group improved over time regardless of various demographic variables, participants in the control group with less education worsened over time, after controlling for age and depression severity. A model incorporating the treatment group, age, sex, and 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores was 77% accurate in its classification of complete remission. Those in the treatment group were 4.3 times more likely (odds ratio 4.31, 95% CI 2.88-6.44) to have complete SI remission than those in the control group. Female participants and those with advanced education beyond high school were approximately 1.4 times more likely (odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.62) to remit than their counterparts. Conclusions: The results highlight the efficacy of an antidepressant intervention in reducing SI, in this case administered via a telehealth platform and with decision support, as well as the importance of considering covariates, or subpopulations, when considering SI.

Telemental Health Collaborative Care Medication Management: Implementation and Outcomes,Population,"Das, S; Wang, JE; Chen, SY; Chen, CNE",TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH,2022,"Introduction: Access to quality mental health medication management (MM) in the United States is limited, even among those with employment-based health insurance. This implementation, feasibility, and outcome study sought to design and evaluate an evidence-based telemental health MM service using a collaborative care model (CoCM).Materials and Methods: CoCM MM was available to adult employees/dependents through their employer benefits, in addition to therapy. Outcomes included Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) collected at baseline and throughout participation. This analysis was not deemed to be human subjects research by the Western Institutional Review Board.Results: Over 17 months, 212 people enrolled and completed >2 assessments; the enrollees were 58.96% female with average age of 32.00 years (standard deviation [SD] = 7.38). In people with moderate to severe depression or anxiety, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores reduced by an average of 7.27 (SD = 4.80) and 6.71 (SD = 5.18) points after at least 12 +/- 4 weeks in the program. At 24 +/- 4 weeks, the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 reductions were on average 7.17 (SD = 5.00) and 6.03 (SD = 5.37), respectively. Approximately 65.88% of participants with either baseline depression or anxiety had a response on either the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 at 12 +/- 4 weeks and 44.71% of participants experienced remission; at 24 +/- 4 weeks, 56.41% had response and 41.03% experienced remission.Conclusions: An evidence-based CoCM telemedicine service within an employee behavioral health benefit is feasible and effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms when using measurement-based care.

Telepsychiatry integration of mental health services into rural primary care settings,Good,"Fortney, JC; Pyne, JM; Turner, EE; Farris, KM; Normoyle, TM; Avery, MD; Hilty, DM; Unützer, J",INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY,2015,"From a population health perspective, the mental health care system in the USA faces two fundamental challenges: (1) a lack of capacity and (2) an inequitable geographic distribution of services. Telepsychiatry can help address the equity problem, and if applied thoughtfully, can also help address the capacity problem. In this paper we describe how telepsychiatry can be used to address the capacity and equity challenges related to the delivery of mental health services in rural areas. Five models of telepsychiatry are described, including (1) the traditional telepsychiatry referral model, (2) The telepsychiatry collaborative care model, (3) the telepsychiatry behavioural health consultant model, (4) the telepsychiatry consultation-liaison model, and (5) the telepsychiatry curbside consultation model. The strong empirical evidence for the telepsychiatry collaborative care model is presented along with two case studies of telepsychiatry consultation in the context of the telepsychiatry collaborative care model. By placing telepsychiatrists and tele-therapists in consultation roles, telepsychiatry collaborative care has the potential to leverage scarce specialist mental health resources to reach more patients, thereby allowing these providers to have a greater population level impact compared to traditional referral models of care. Comparative effectiveness trials are needed to identify which models of telepsychiatry are the most appropriate for patients with complex psychiatric disorders.",10.3109/09540261.2015.1085838,wos,Psychiatry,Collaborative care; integrated care; rural; telepsychiatry; virtual care,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3109/09540261.2015.1085838)

Telerehabilitation Programme as a Maintenance Strategy for COPD Patients: A 12-Month Randomized Clinical Trial,Not mental health,"Galdiz, JB; Gómez, A; Rodriguez, D; Guell, R; Cebollero, P; Hueto, J; Cejudo, P; Ortega, F; Sayago, I; Chic, S; Iscar, M; Amado, C; Trigo, GR; Cosio, BG; Bustamante, V; Pijoan, JI",ARCHIVOS DE BRONCONEUMOLOGIA,2021,"Background: There is uncertainty regarding efficacy of telehealth-based approaches in COPD patients for sustaining benefits achieved with intensive pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Research question: To determine whether a maintenance pulmonary telerehabilitation (TelePR) programme, after intensive initial PR, is superior to usual care in sustaining over time benefits achieved by intensive PR. Study design and methods: A multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted. Two groups were created at completion of an 8-week intensive outpatient hospital PR programme. Intervention group (IG) patients were given appropriate training equipment and instructed to perform three weekly training sessions and send performance data through an app to a web-based platform. Patients in the control group (CG) were advised to exercise regularly (usual care). Results: Ninety-four patients (46 IG, 48 CG) were randomized. The analysis of covariance showed non-significant improvements in 6-min walk distance [19.9 m (95% CI -4.1/+43.8)] and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire - Emotion score [0.4 points (0-0.8)] in the IG. Secondary linear mixed models showed improvements in the IG in Short Form-36 mental component summary [9.7, (4.0-15.4)] and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire - Emotion [0.5, (0.2-0.9)] scores, but there was no association between compliance and outcomes. Acute exacerbations were associated with a marginally significant decrease in 6-minute walk distance of 15.8 m (-32.3/0.8) in linear models. Conclusions: The TelePR maintenance strategy was both feasible and safe but failed to show superiority over usual care, despite improvements in some HRQoL domains. Acute exacerbations may have an important negative influence on long-term physical function. (C) 2020 SEPAR. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Temporary improvement of cognitive and behavioral scales for Dementia elderly by Shiritori word game with a dialogue robot: A pilot study,Not mental health,"Sugiyama, H; Nakamura, K",FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI,2022,"Communication therapies based on conversations with caregivers, such as reminiscence therapy and music therapy, have been proposed to delay the progression of dementia. Although these therapies have been reported to improve the cognitive and behavioral functions of elderly people suffering from dementia, caregivers do not have enough time to spend on administering such communication therapies, especially in Japan where the workforce of caregivers is inadequate. Consequently, the progression of dementia in the elderly and the accompanying increased burden on caregivers has become a social problem. While the automation of communication therapy using robots and virtual agents has been proposed, the accuracy of both speech recognition and dialogue control is still insufficient to improve the cognitive and behavioral functions of the dementia elderly. In this study, we examine the effect of a Japanese word-chain game (Shiritori game) with an interactive robot and that of music listening on the maintenance and improvement of cognitive and behavioral scales [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Dementia Behavior Disturbance scale (DBD)] of the dementia elderly. These activities can provide linguistic and phonetic stimuli, and they are simpler to implement than conventional daily conversation. The results of our Wizard-of-Oz-based experiments show that the cognitive and behavioral function scores of the elderly who periodically played the Shiritori game with an interactive robot were significantly improved over the elderly in a control group. On the other hand, no such effect was observed with the music listening stimuli. Our further experiments showed that, in the Shiritori intervention group, there was a ceiling on the increase in MMSE. The lower the MMSE before participating in the experiment, the greater the increase. Furthermore, greater improvement in DBD was observed when the participants actively played the Shiritori game. Since the Shiritori game is relatively easy to automate, our findings show the potential benefits of automating dementia therapies to maintain cognitive and behavioral functions.",10.3389/frobt.2022.941056,"pubmed, wos",Robotics,Dementia; WOZ test; Shiritori word game; music listening therapy; decreasing BPSD; improving cognitive and behavioral scales,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2022.941056)

We aimed to test a novel cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) app-based intervention on insomnia symptoms and social psychological factors in people with epilepsy and to examine the possible mechanisms among the factors. Methods: Participants were recruited from neurology clinics in Iran and comprised individuals diagnosed with epilepsy and having moderate to severe insomnia. A two-arm randomized controlled trial design was used, consisting of a treatment group (CBT-I; n = 160) and control group (patient education; n = 160). Primary outcomes were self-reported sleep quality, insomnia severity, and sleep hygiene behavior and objective sleep characteristics measured by actigraphy. Secondary outcomes were attitude, perceived behavioral control, intention, action planning, coping planning, behavioral automaticity, self-monitoring, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL). All outcomes were measured at baseline, and at one, three, and six months postintervention, except objective sleep, which was assessed at baseline, and one and six months postintervention. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. Results: Current findings showed that sleep quality, insomnia severity, sleep hygiene behavior, and sleep onset latency were significantly improved in the CBT-I group compared with the patient education group at all measurement points. Also, the CBT-I group had significantly improved anxiety, depression, and QoL compared with the patient education group. Mediation analyses showed that attitude, intention, coping planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on sleep outcomes. Conclusion: Results support the use of the CBT-I app to improve sleep outcomes among people with epilepsy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

High sedentary behavior levels potentially contribute to this morbidity. Smartphone apps may be feasible to facilitate sedentary behavior reductions and lead to reduced health care use. Objective: We aimed to test the effect of a sedentary behavior change smartphone app (Vire app and ToDo-CR program) as an adjunct to cardiac rehabilitation on hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) presentations over 12 months.Methods: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted with 120 participants recruited from 3 cardiac rehabilitation programs. Participants were randomized 1:1 to cardiac rehabilitation plus the fully automated 6-month Vire app and ToDo-CR program (intervention) or usual care (control). The primary outcome was nonelective hospital admissions and ED presentations over 12 months. Secondary outcomes including accelerometer-measured sedentary behavior, BMI, waist circumference, and quality of life were recorded at baseline and 6 and 12 months. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the primary outcome, and linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze secondary outcomes. Data on intervention and hospital admission costs were collected, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated.Results: Participants were, on average, aged 62 (SD 10) years, and the majority were male (93/120, 77.5%). The intervention group were more likely to experience all-cause (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% CI 0.58-4.10; P=.39) and cardiac-related (OR 3.26, 95% CI 0.84-12.55; P=.09) hospital admissions and ED presentations (OR 2.07, 95% CI 0.89-4.77; P=.09) than the control group.

The intervention was more effective but more costly in reducing sedentary behavior (ICER Aus $351.77) and anxiety (ICER Aus $10,987.71) at 12 months. The intervention was also more effective yet costly in increasing quality of life (ICER Aus $93,395.50) at 12 months.Conclusions: The Vire app and ToDo-CR program was not an outcome-effective or cost-effective solution to reduce all-cause hospital admissions or ED presentations in cardiac rehabilitation compared with usual care.

Testing the Pragmatic Effectiveness of a Consumer-Based Mindfulness Mobile App in the Workplace: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Huberty, JL; Espel-Huynh, HM; Neher, TL; Puzia, ME",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2022,"Background: Mental health and sleep problems are prevalent in the workforce, corresponding to costly impairment in productivity and increased health care use. Digital mindfulness interventions are efficacious in improving sleep and mental health in the workplace; however, evidence supporting their pragmatic utility, potential for improving productivity, and ability to reduce employer costs is limited.Objective: This pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the experimental effects of implementing a commercially available mindfulness app-Calm-in employees of a large, multisite employer in the United States. Outcomes included mental health (depression, anxiety, and stress), sleep (insomnia and daytime sleepiness), resilience, productivity impairment (absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work impairment, and non-work activity impairment), and health care use (medical visit frequency).Methods: Employees were randomized at the work site to receive either the Calm app intervention or waitlist control. Participants in the Calm intervention group were instructed to use the Calm app for 10 minutes per day for 8 weeks; individuals with elevated baseline insomnia symptoms could opt-in to 6 weeks of sleep coaching. All outcomes were assessed every 2 weeks, with the exception of medical visits (weeks 4 and 8 only). Effects of the Calm intervention on outcomes were evaluated via mixed effects modeling, controlling for relevant baseline characteristics, with fixed effects of the intervention on outcomes assessed at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. Models were analyzed via complete-case and intent-to-treat analyses. Results: A total of 1029 employees enrolled (n=585 in the Calm intervention group, including 101 who opted-in to sleep coaching, and n=444 in waitlist control). Of them, 192 (n=88 for the Calm intervention group and n=104 for waitlist) completed all 5 assessments. In the complete-case analysis at week 8, employees at sites randomized to the Calm intervention group experienced significant improvements in depression (P=.02), anxiety (P=.01), stress (P<.001), insomnia (P<.001), sleepiness (P<.001), resilience (P=.02), presenteeism (P=.01), overall work impairment (P=.004), and nonwork impairment (P<.001), and reduced medical care visit frequency (P<.001) and productivity impairment costs (P=.01), relative to the waitlist control. In the intent-to-treat analysis at week 8, significant benefits of the intervention were observed for depression (P=.046), anxiety (P=.01), insomnia (P<.001), sleepiness (P<.001), nonwork impairment (P=.04), and medical visit frequency (P<.001).Conclusions: The results suggest that the Calm app is an effective workplace intervention for improving mental health, sleep, resilience, and productivity and for reducing medical visits and costs owing to work impairment. Future studies should identify optimal implementation strategies that maximize employee uptake and large-scale implementation success across diverse, geographically dispersed employers.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05120310; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05120310",10.2196/38903,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,mindfulness; mobile apps; workforce; workplace; presenteeism; mental health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/38903)

Text Messages Exchanged Between Individuals With Opioid Use Disorder and Their mHealth e-Coaches: Content Analysis Study,Good,"Ranjit, YS; Davis, WM; Fentem, A; Riordan, R; Roscoe, R; Cavazos-Rehg, P",JMIR HUMAN FACTORS,2023,"Background: Opioid use disorder (OUD) has affected 2.2 million people in the United States. About 7.2 million people reported using illicit drugs in 2019, which contributed to over 70,000 overdose deaths. SMS text messaging interventions have been shown to be effective in OUD recovery. However, the interpersonal communication between individuals in OUD treatment and a support team on digital platforms has not been well examined.Objective: This study aims to understand the communication between participants undergoing OUD recovery and their e-coaches by examining the SMS text messages exchanged from the lens of social support and the issues related to OUD treatment.Methods: A content analysis of messages exchanged between individuals recovering from OUD and members of a support team was conducted. Participants were enrolled in a mobile health intervention titled uMAT-R, a primary feature of which is the ability for patients to instantly connect with a recovery support staff or an e-coach via in-app messaging. Our team analyzed dyadic text-based messages of over 12 months. In total, 70 participants' messages and 1196 unique messages were analyzed using a social support framework and OUD recovery topics.Results: Out of 70 participants, 44 (63%) were between the ages of 31 and 50 years, 47 (67%) were female, 41 (59%) were Caucasian, and 42 (60%) reported living in unstable housing conditions. An average of 17 (SD 16.05) messages were exchanged between each participant and their e-coach. Out of 1196 messages, 64% (n=766) messages were sent by e-coaches and 36% (n=430) by participants. Messages of emotional support occurred the most, with 196 occurrences (n=9, 0.8%) and e-coaches (n=187, 15.6%). Messages of material support had 110 occurrences (participants: n=8, 0.7%; e-coaches: n=102, 8.5%). With OUD recovery topics, opioid use risk factors appeared in most (n=72) occurrences (patient: n=66, 5.5%; e-coach: n=6, 0.5%), followed by a message of avoidance of drug use 3.9% (n=47), which occurred mainly from participants. Depression was correlated with messages of social support (r=0.27; P=.02).Conclusions: Individuals with OUD who had mobile health needs tended to engage in instant messaging with the recovery support staff. Participants who are engaged in messaging often engage in conversations around risk factors and avoidance of drug use.

With the advent of targeted therapies for ARCAs, disease registries have become a precious source of real-world quantitative and qualitative data complementing knowledge from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Here, we review the ARCA Registry, a global collaborative multicenter platform (>15 countries, >30 sites) with the overarching goal to advance trial readiness in ARCAs. It presents a good clinical practice (GCP)- and general data protection regulation (GDPR)-compliant professional-reported registry for multicenter web-based capture of cross-center standardized longitudinal data. Modular electronic case report forms (eCRFs) with core, extended, and optional datasets allow data capture tailored to the participating site's variable interests and resources. The eCRFs cover all key data elements required by regulatory authorities [European Medicines Agency (EMA)] and the European Rare Disease (ERD) platform. They capture genotype, phenotype, and progression and include demographic data, biomarkers, comorbidity, medication, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and longitudinal clinician- or patient-reported ratings of ataxia severity, non-ataxia features, disease stage, activities of daily living, and (mental) health status. Moreover, they are aligned to major autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and sporadic ataxia (SPORTAX) registries in the field, thus allowing for joint and comparative analyses not only across ARCAs but also with SCAs and sporadic ataxias. The registry is at the core of a systematic multi-component ARCA database cluster with a linked biobank and an evolving study database for digital outcome measures. Currently, the registry contains more than 800 patients with almost 1,500 visits representing all ages and disease stages; 65% of patients with established genetic diagnoses capture all the main ARCA genes, and 35% with unsolved diagnoses are targets for advanced next-generation sequencing. The ARCA Registry serves as the backbone of many major European and transatlantic consortia, such as PREPARE, PROSPAX, and the Ataxia Global Initiative, with additional data input from SPORTAX.

Well-prepared and informed children have better outcomes (less procedural anxiety and higher satisfaction). A digital therapeutic (DTx) platform (Xploro) was developed with children to provide health information through gamification, serious games, a chatbot, and an augmented reality avatar. Objective: This before and after evaluation study aims to assess the acceptability of the Xploro DTx and examine its impact on children and their parent's procedural knowledge, procedural anxiety, and reported experiences when attending a hospital for a planned procedure. Methods: We used a mixed methods design with quantitative measures and qualitative data collected sequentially from a group of children who received standard hospital information (before group) and a group of children who received the DTx intervention (after group). Participants were children aged between 8 and 14 years and their parents who attended a hospital for a planned clinical procedure at a children's hospital in North West England. Children and their parents completed self-report measures (perceived knowledge, procedural anxiety, procedural satisfaction, and procedural involvement) at baseline, preprocedure, and postprocedure. Results: A total of 80 children (n=40 standard care group and n=40 intervention group) and their parents participated in the study; the children were aged between 8 and 14 years (average 10.4, SD 2.27 years) and were attending a hospital for a range of procedures. The children in the intervention group reported significantly lower levels of procedural anxiety before the procedure than those in the standard group (two-tailed t63.64=2.740; P=.008). The children in the intervention group also felt more involved in their procedure than those in the standard group (t75=-2.238; P=.03). The children in the intervention group also reported significantly higher levels of perceived procedural knowledge preprocedure (t59.98=-4.892; P=.001) than those in the standard group. As for parents, those with access to the Xploro intervention reported significantly lower levels of procedural anxiety preprocedure than those who did not (t68.51=1.985; P=.05). During the semistructured write and tell interviews, children stated that they enjoyed using the intervention, it was fun and easy to use, and they felt that it had positively influenced their experiences of coming to the hospital for a procedure. Conclusions: This study has shown that the DTx platform, Xploro, has a positive impact on children attending a hospital for a procedure by reducing levels of procedural anxiety.

MLC901 (Neuroaid II) is a simplified form of MLC601 (Neuroaid), a Traditional Chinese Medicine with neuroprotective and neuroproliferative properties in cellular and animal models of brain injury. MLC601 has been shown to modulate amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in human neuroblastoma cell cultures and increase the levels of soluble APP alpha. In addition, MLC901 has been shown to reduce tau phosphorylation invitro. Hence, MLC901 may have possible multimodal actions and a disease-modifying effect in AD. In previous clinical studies, MLC601 has shown promising effects in AD. ObjectiveTo investigate the safety and efficacy of MLC901 add-on therapy to standard treatment in mild-to-moderate probable AD patients stable on standard treatment and to evaluate if MLC901 has a disease-modifying effect in AD. MethodsThis is a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in mild-to-moderate probable AD where MLC901 will be given as an add-on therapy to standard AD treatment, followed by an extension study for another 6months, where all subjects will be treated with open-label MLC901 in addition to standard treatment. The primary outcome is safety as measured by adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, and physical and neurological examinations.

Literature on the impact on individuals with eating disorders is slowly emerging. While outpatient eating disorder services in Canada have attempted to transition to virtual care, guidelines related to optimal virtual care in this field are lacking. As such, the objective of our Canadian Consensus Panel was to develop clinical practice guidelines related to the provision of virtual care for children, adolescents, and emerging adults living with an eating disorder, as well as their caregivers, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Methods Using scoping review methodology (with literature in databases from 2000 to 2020 and grey literature from 2010 to 2020), the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation tool, and a panel of diverse stakeholders from across Canada, we developed high quality treatment guidelines that are focused on virtual interventions for children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, and their caregivers. Results Strong recommendations were supported specifically in favour of in-person medical evaluation when necessary for children, adolescents, and emerging adults, and that equity-seeking groups and marginalized youth should be provided equal access to treatment. For children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for telehealth family-based treatment (FBT) and online guided parental self-help FBT. For emerging adults, internet cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-based guided self-help was strongly recommended. Weak recommendations for emerging adults included CBT-based group internet interventions as treatment adjuncts, internet-based relapse prevention Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) guided self-help, telehealth relapse prevention using MANTRA, and guided CBT-based smartphone apps as treatment adjuncts. For caregivers of children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for virtual parent meal support training, and moderated online caregiver forums and support groups. For caregivers of emerging adults, guided parental self-help CBT was strongly recommended, and unguided caregiver psychoeducation self-help was weakly recommended.

Mean costs and outcomes were compared at 18 months and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Uncertainty analysis using bootstrapping and sensitivity analyses was conducted. Study results The sample included 170 participants: Horyzons intervention group (n = 86) and TAU (n = 84). Total costs were significantly lower in the Horyzons group compared with TAU from both the healthcare sector (-AU$4789.59; P < .001) and the societal perspective (-AU$5131.14; P < .001). In the CEA, Horyzons was dominant, meaning it was less costly and resulted in better social functioning. In the CUA, the Horyzons intervention resulted in fewer costs but also yielded fewer QALYs. However, group differences in outcomes were not statistically significant. When young people engaged more with the platform, costs were shown to decrease and outcomes improved. Conclusions The Horyzons intervention offers a cost-effective approach for improving social functioning in young people with FEP after discharge from early intervention services.",10.1093/schbul/sbad071,wos,Psychiatry,economic evaluation; psychosis; online intervention; social functioning; quality of life; youth,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbad071)
The Course of the Working Alliance during Virtual Reality and Exposure Group Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder,Good,"Ngai, I; Tully, EC; Anderson, PL",BEHAVIOURAL AND COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY,2015,"Background: Psychoanalytic theory and some empirical research suggest the working alliance follows a rupture and repair pattern over the course of therapy, but given its emphasis on collaboration, cognitive behavioral therapy may yield a different trajectory. Aims: The current study compares the trajectory of the working alliance during two types of cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder - virtual reality exposure therapy (VRE) and exposure group therapy (EGT), one of which (VRE) has been proposed to show lower levels of working alliance due to the physical barriers posed by the technology (e.g. no eye contact with therapist during exposure). Method: Following randomization, participants (N = 63) diagnosed with social anxiety disorder received eight sessions of manualized EGT or individual VRE and completed a standardized self-report measure of working alliance after each session. Results: Hierarchical linear modeling showed overall high levels of working alliance that changed in rates of growth over time; that is, increases in working alliance scores were steeper at the beginning of therapy and slowed towards the end of therapy. There were no differences in working alliance between the two treatment groups. Conclusion: Results neither support a rupture/repair pattern nor the idea that the working alliance is lower for VRE participants. Findings are consistent with the idea that different therapeutic approaches may yield different working alliance trajectories.",10.1017/S135246581300088X,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,Social anxiety disorder; working alliance; virtual reality exposure therapy; exposure group therapy; cognitive behavioral therapy,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1017/S135246581300088X)

The Effect of Digital Literacy on Participation in Social Media Clinical Trials in Cancer: Tailoring an Informed Consent Process,Not mental health,"Oliver, DP; Demiris, G; Washington, KT; Pitzer, K; Ulrich, C",TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH,2022,Introduction: This study asked: (1) How does digital literacy influence one's decision to consent to a social media intervention study? (2) What is a brief way to assess individual digital literacy before an individual's decision to participate in a trial? and (3) How can a consent process be tailored around an individual's digital literacy level?Methods: We used an assessment tool to investigate digital literacy of those who chose to consent to a clinical trial and those who did not consent to the clinical trial but agreed to participate in a digital literacy study.Results A total of 161 hospice caregivers completed the digital literacy assessment. Older individuals and those who rated themselves as more proficient in the use of technology and social media were more likely to consent to the social media clinical trial.Conclusions: We found that asking participants to rate their technology skills and social media skills allows researchers to tailor a consent process. For those who are comfortable with technology and social media the traditional process is appropriate. For individuals that rate themselves with weaker technology and social media skills it is important that the consent process includes assurance they will receive adequate support in the use of the technology and the media. The next step is to test the assessment and tailoring of consent processes for a social media clinical trial.

The Effect of Nurse Companionship on Anxiety and Vital Sign Changes of Cesarean Section Candidates: A Randomized Control Trial,Not Digital,"Roshangar, F; Lotfi, M; Aghazadeh, AM; Asghari, E; Aghaei, E",CRESCENT JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,2020,"Objectives: Cesarean section (C-section) is one of the most common surgeries for women, which has numerous complications including anxiety and vital sign changes. Various non-drug methods exist for controlling these complications. Although nurse companionship is one of such methods, there is little information about the accompaniment of mothers by trained nurses during the C-section surgery. This study aimed to determine the effect of nurse companionship on the level of anxiety and vital sign changes of C-section candidates. Materials and Methods: Using a random allocation method, this randomized control trial was performed on 128 C-section candidates in Al-Zahra teaching hospital of Tabriz in 2017. In addition to routine cares, intervention group mothers were accompanied and supported by a nurse 1 hour before to after the C-section surgery while mothers in the control group only received routine cares for the C-section. Data collection tools were demographic information form, visual analogue scale (VAS), digital blood pressure monitor, and chronometer. The anxiety level and vital sign changes were measured one hour before, during, and one hour after the C-section surgery. Finally, data were analyzed by SPSS 24 using the mixed repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The comparison of the results of the two groups showed that the accompaniment of the mothers had a significant effect on reducing anxiety during (P < 0.001) and 1 hour after (P = 0.011) C-section surgery while it had no significant effect on vital sign changes. Conclusions: The results revealed the positive effect of nurse companionship on reducing mothers' anxiety during and after the C-section surgery. Therefore, this method can be used as non-invasive nursing care during C-section surgeries and in operating rooms. However, cost-effectiveness assessment is recommended before the implementation of this method.",NA,wos,General & Internal Medicine,Cesarean section; Anxiety; Vital signs; Nurse companionship,URI::(https://www.doi.org/NA)

The Effect of Reminiscence Therapy Using Virtual Reality on Apathy in Residential Aged Care: Multisite Nonrandomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Saredakis, D; Keage, HAD; Corlis, M; Ghezzi, ES; Loffler, H; Loetscher, T",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2021,"Background: Apathy is a frequent and underrecognized neurological disorder symptom. Reduced goal-directed behavior caused by apathy is associated with poor outcomes for older adults in residential aged care. Recommended nonpharmacological treatments include person-centered therapy using information and communication technology. Virtual reality (VR) in the form of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is a fully immersive technology that provides access to a wide range of freely available content. The use of VR as a therapy tool has demonstrated promise in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety. In addition, VR has been used to improve conditions including depression, anxiety, cognitive function, and balance in older adults with memory deficits, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease. Research using VR for the symptoms of apathy in older adults living in residential aged care facilities is limited. Objective: This study aims to examine whether using HMDs as a tool for reminiscence therapy improves the symptoms of apathy compared with using a laptop computer and physical items with older adults living in residential aged care. Methods: In this multisite trial, 43 participants were allocated to one of three groups: reminiscence therapy intervention using VR in the form of HMDs, reminiscence therapy using a laptop computer supplemented by physical items if required (active control), and a usual care (passive control) group. The primary outcome was apathy, and the secondary outcomes included cognition and depression. The side effects of using HMDs were also measured in the VR group. Results: Mixed model analyses revealed no significant group interaction over time in outcomes between the VR and laptop groups (estimate=-2.24, SE 1.89; t(40)=-1.18; P=.24). Pooled apathy scores in the two intervention groups compared with the passive control group also revealed no significant group interaction over time (estimate=-0.26, SE 1.66; t(40)=-0.16; P=.88). There were no significant secondary outcomes. Most participants in the VR group stated that they would prefer to watch content in VR than on a flat screen (chi(2)(2)=11.2; P=.004), side effects from HMD use were negligible to minimal according to the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire cutoff scores. Conclusions: Although there were no significant results in outcome measures, this study found that participants engaged in the research and enjoyed the process of reminiscing using both forms of technology. It was found that VR can be implemented in an aged care setting with correct protocols in place. Providing residents in aged care with a choice of technology may assist in increasing participation in activities.

"The Effect of Showing Images of the Foetus with the Virtual Reality Glass During Labour Process on Labour Pain, Birth Perception and Anxiety",Not Multi User,"Akin, B; Kocak, MY; Küçükaydin, Z; Güzel, K",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING,2021,"Aim and objectives This study was conducted to determine the effect of showing images of the foetus to the pregnant women with the virtual reality glass during labour process on labour pain, childbirth perception and anxiety level. Background Virtual reality is an effective and inexpensive method that allows the creation of simulated scenarios in which it interacts with the virtual environment with multisensory stimuli. Design This is a randomised controlled experimental study. This study was conducted with the guidelines of Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). The study was enrolled in the Clinical Trials database (NCT04664114). Methods The study included 100 pregnant women (50 intervention group and 50 control group). Ultrasound images of the foetus were recorded on the 28th week of pregnancy of the women in the intervention group. These images were shown to the women with the virtual reality glass during labour process. Routine procedures were carried out for the women in the control group. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was applied to both groups when cervical dilatation was 4 cm and 9 cm. The Women's Perception for the Scale of Supportive Care Given During Labor (POBS) and the Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS) were applied almost two hours after labour. Results The VAS scores of the women in the intervention group with 9 cm dilatation and their PASS mean scores were significantly lower than women in the control group while their POBS score were significantly higher (p < 0.01). Conclusion The results of this study show that showing images of the foetus to women with virtual reality decreased labour pain and anxiety level. Relevance to clinical practice It is known that supportive care given during labour is important both for the mother's and baby's health. Therefore, it is important that nurses and midwives, who spend the most time with women and provide the most support, reduce the pain and anxiety of the woman with nonpharmacological practices and make them feel positive feelings about delivery.",10.1111/jocn.15768,"pubmed, wos",Nursing,anxiety; labour; pain; virtual reality,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15768)

The intervention group watched and listened to beach and nature content with virtual reality glasses for 30 minutes. The con-trol group also received standard care. An Introductory Information Form, the State Anxiety Scale, and the Cancer Fatigue Scale were used for data collection. The scales were administered to the groups before the intervention, followed by practice or standard care, and then the scales were re-administered. All patients were evaluated for each cycle over four cycles. Conclusion: In the intervention group, the mean post-application anxiety scores decreased compared with the mean pretest scores, and the mean posttest anxiety scores decreased from the first cycle to the last cycle. In addition, the mean post-test anxiety scores of the intervention group were found to be lower in all four cycles than the mean post-test anxiety scores of the control group. In the intervention group, the mean post -test fatigue and subscales scores decreased in all cycles compared with the mean pre-test scores. Implications for Nursing Practice: This research has shown that the use of virtual reality glasses is effective in reducing anxiety and fatigue scale scores and their subscales in patients with breast cancer. For this reason, it is recommended to introduce the use of virtual reality glasses to patients and to present their use according to patients' preferences.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

The Effect of a Sepsis Interprofessional Education Using Virtual Patient Telesimulation on Sepsis Team Care in Clinical Practice: Mixed Methods Study,Not mental health,"Chua, WL; Ooi, SL; Chan, GWH; Lau, TC; Liaw, SY",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Improving interprofessional communication and collaboration is necessary to facilitate the early identification and treatment of patients with sepsis. Preparing undergraduate medical and nursing students for the knowledge and skills required to assess, escalate, and manage patients with sepsis is crucial for their entry into clinical practice. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures have created the need for interactive distance learning to support collaborative learning. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sepsis interprofessional education on medical and nursing students' sepsis knowledge, team communication skills, and skill use in clinical practice. Methods: A mixed methods design using a 1-group pretest-posttest design and focus group discussions was used. This study involved 415 undergraduate medical and nursing students from a university in Singapore. After a baseline evaluation of the participants' sepsis knowledge and team communication skills, they underwent didactic e-learning followed by virtual telesimulation on early recognition and management of sepsis and team communication strategies. The participants' sepsis knowledge and team communication skills were evaluated immediately and 2 months after the telesimulation. In total, 4 focus group discussions were conducted using a purposive sample of 18 medical and nursing students to explore their transfer of learning to clinical practice. Results: Compared with the baseline scores, both the medical and nursing students demonstrated a significant improvement in sepsis knowledge (P<.001) and team communication skills (P<.001) in immediate posttest scores. At the 2-month follow-up, the nursing students continued to have statistically significantly higher sepsis knowledge (P<.001) and communication scores (P<.001) than the pretest scores, whereas the medical students had no significant changes in test scores between the 2-month follow-up and pretest time points (P=.99). A total of three themes emerged from the qualitative findings: greater understanding of each other's roles, application of mental models in clinical practice, and theory-practice gaps. The sepsis interprofessional education-particularly the use of virtual telesimulation-fostered participants' understanding and appreciation of each other's interprofessional roles when caring for patients with sepsis. Despite noting some incongruities with the real-world clinical practice and not encountering many sepsis scenarios in clinical settings, participants shared the application of mental models using interprofessional communication strategies and the patient assessment framework in their daily clinical practice. Conclusions: Although the study did not show long-term knowledge retention, the use of virtual telesimulation played a critical role in facilitating the application of mental models for learning transfer and therefore could serve as a promising education modality for sepsis training. For a greater clinical effect, future studies could complement virtual telesimulation with a mannequin-based simulation and provide more evidence on the long-term retention of sepsis knowledge and clinical skills performance.",10.2196/35058,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,sepsis; interprofessional education; team training; nurse-physician communication; simulation; telesimulation,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/35058)

In a randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 68 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The MCI diagnosis was based on medical evaluations through a clinical interview conducted by a dementia specialist. Cognitive assessments were performed by neuropsychologists according to standardized methods, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and frontal cognitive function: trail making test (TMT) A & B, and symbol digit substitute test (SDST). Resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured in eyes open and eyes closed conditions for 5 minutes each, with a 19-channel wireless EEG device. The VR intervention program (3 times/week, 100 min each session) comprised four types of VR game-based content to improve the attention, memory and processing speed. Analysis of the subjects for group-time interactions revealed that the intervention group exhibited a significantly improved executive function and brain function at the resting state. Additionally, gait speed and mobility were also significantly improved between and after the follow-up. The VR-based training program improved cognitive and physical function in patients with MCI relative to controls.

The Effect of a Web-Based Deep Breathing App on Stress of Direct Care Workers: Uncontrolled Intervention Study,Not Multi User,"Kim, J; Gray, JA; Johnson, H",JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE,2021,"Objectives: Studies have demonstrated success in reducing stress levels in complex interventions including deep breathing components. Breathing exercise interventions, however, tend not to be studied in isolation. The aim of the study was to examine the impact of a breathing exercise using a web-based app on the stress levels of direct care workers (DCWs) who serve people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Design: Uncontrolled one-group intervention. Settings/Location: DCWs were recruited from intellectual and developmental disability service providers in a US Midwestern state. Subjects: Sixty-four DCWs who used the breathing exercise app at least 2 times. Interventions: Breathing exercise using a web-based app for a month. Outcome measures: Five measures were obtained from the data recorded in the app: initial stress level before exercise, exercise duration in minutes, change in stress level between before and after each breathing exercise, and frequency and number of days the app was used during a month. Participants' self-report of the number of days of app use was collected in a 1-month follow-up survey. Results: The participants appear to have a moderate stress level indicated by the initial stress level 5 out of 10. After the breathing exercise, the stress level decreased by 1.2 points from 5.0 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.8) to 3.7 (SD = 1.6) on average (paired t-test, p < 0.00005). Cohen's d 0.72 indicates a large effect size. Among within-individual factors, a higher initial stress level and longer app use per occasion were significantly associated with stress reduction. Among between-individual factors, only race was associated with stress reduction. Although there was no effect of being an African American alone on stress level change (coefficient = 0.44, 95% confidence interval = -0.29 to 1.18, p > 0.05), there was an additional reduction among African Americans in relation to the initial stress level, controlling for exercise duration. The number of breathing exercise days recorded in the app was not correlated with that of self-report (Pearson's correlation r = 0.12, p > 0.05). Although the app was used for 4.4 (SD = 4.2) days, participants reported using it for 10.7 (SD = 8.2) days on average in the follow-up survey. Conclusions: The findings suggest the benefit of breathing exercises using an app for reducing DCWs' stress levels.

Psychoeducational intervention via a website could be effective for primary prevention of mental illness among workers in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the effect of a newly developed online psychoeducational website named Imacoco Care on reducing psychological distress and fear about COVID-19 infection among workers. Methods: Participants in the study were recruited from registered members of a web survey company in Japan. Participants who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group were invited to access the Imacoco Care program within a month after the baseline survey. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) scores were obtained at baseline and at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Results: A total of 1200 workers were randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups (n=600 [50%] per group). The Imacoco Care intervention group showed a significant favorable effect on K6 scores (P=.03) with a small effect size (ES; Cohen d=-0.14) and an adverse effect on FCV-19S scores (P=.01) with a small ES (Cohen d=0.16) at 3-month follow-up. In the per protocol analysis (including only participants who had read the Imacoco Care content at least 1 time), the Imacoco Care intervention group also showed a significant favorable effect on reducing K6 scores (P=.03), while an adverse effect on FCV-19S scores was not significant (P=.06) in the intervention group at 3-month follow-up.

The Interactive Mobile Health and Rehabilitation (iMHere) mobile health (mHealth) system was developed to support self-management for individuals with disabilities. Objective: The main objective of this study was to determine if the use of iMHere would be associated with improved health outcomes over a 9-month period. A secondary objective was to determine if the use of iMHere would be associated with improved psychosocial outcomes. Phone usage, app usage, and training time data were also collected to analyze trends in iMHere use. Methods: Overall, 38 participants with SCI were randomized into either the intervention group who used the iMHere system and received standard care or the control group who received standard care without any technology intervention. Health outcomes were recorded for the year before entry into the study and during the 9 months of the study. Participants completed surveys at baseline and every 3 months to measure psychosocial outcomes. Results: The intervention group had a statistically significant reduction in UTIs (0.47 events per person; P=.03; number needed to treat=2.11). Although no psychosocial outcomes changed significantly, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in mood symptoms in the intervention group compared with the control group meeting the threshold for clinical significance. Approximately 34 min per participant per month were needed on average to manage the system and provide technical support through this mHealth system. Conclusions: The use of the iMHere mHealth system may be a valuable tool in the prevention of UTIs or reductions in depressive symptoms.

The collaborative care model is increasingly being adopted to improve access to services and to promote diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric diseases. Objective: This systematic review seeks to summarize what is known about collaborative care on depression outcomes for racial/ethnic minorities in the United States. Methods: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method. Collaborative care studies were included if they comprised adults from at least one racial/ethnic minority group, were located in primary care clinics in the United States, and had depression outcome measures. Core principles described by the University of Washington Advancing Integrated Mental Health Solutions Center were used to define the components of collaborative care. Results: Of 398 titles screened, 169 full-length articles were assessed for eligibility, and 19 studies were included in our review (10 randomized controlled trials, 9 observational). Results show there is potential that collaborative care, with or without cultural/linguistic tailoring, is effective in improving depression for racial/ethnic minorities, including those from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Conclusions: Collaborative care should be explored as an intervention for treating depression for racial/ethnic minority patients in primary care. Questions remain as to what elements of cultural adaptation are most helpful, factors behind the difficulty in recruiting minority patients for these studies, and how the inclusion of virtual components changes access to and delivery of care.

The Effectiveness of Internet-Guided Self-help Interventions to Promote Physical Activity Among Individuals With Depression: Systematic Review,Good,"Tang, YL; Gierc, M; Lam, RW; Liu, SM; Faulkner, G",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2022,"Background: Depression is a prevalent and debilitating mental disorder and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Physical activity (PA) interventions have been shown to alleviate depressive symptoms. However, not all patients have access to PA programing tailored for depression. Internet-guided self-help (IGSH) interventions may be an effective option for increasing PA among people with depression who cannot or prefer not to access supervised exercise treatment. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of IGSH interventions in increasing PA and alleviating depressive symptoms in people with depression. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted for randomized controlled trials and quasiexperimental studies using 9 electronic databases. The review was registered in PROSPERO (2020 CRD42020221713). Results: A total of 4 randomized controlled trials (430 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 3 were web-based and 1 was app-based. Three studies found IGSH interventions to have medium to large effects on decreasing depressive symptoms but not on increasing PA compared with waitlist or usual care. One study showed increased self-reported PA but no significant difference in depressive symptoms in the intervention group compared with the control group. Goal setting was the most common behavior change technique used in the interventions. Dropout rates within the intervention groups were relatively low (0%-19%). Conclusions: Our findings suggested that IGSH PA interventions are feasible and have the potential to reduce depressive symptoms in people with depression. More well-designed and tailored interventions with different combinations of behavior change techniques, particularly those targeting the emotion domain, are needed to assess the overall effectiveness and feasibility of using IGSH interventions to increase PA among people with depression.",10.2196/38049,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,physical activity; eHealth; mobile health; mHealth; depression; systematic review; internet; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/38049)
The Effectiveness of Web-Based Psychotherapy to Treat and Prevent Burnout: Controlled Trial,Good,"Michelsen, C; Kjellgren, A",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Burnout is a hidden productivity killer in organizations. Finding a solution to efficiently measure and proactively prevent or rehabilitate employees with burnout is a challenge. To meet this unabated demand, companies and caregivers can focus on proactive measures to prevent Burnout as an Occupational Phenomenon. Objective: We aimed to address effectiveness, reliability, and validity of the empowerment for participation (EFP) batch of assessments to measure burnout risk in relation to the efficacy of web-based interventions using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and floating to improve mental health and well-being. We introduced three risk assessments: risk for burnout, risk of anxiety, and risk for depression. Methods: We used an interventional, empirical, and parallel design using raw EFP psychometric data to measure the effectiveness of web-based therapy to reduce the risk of burnout between a control group and web-based therapy group. A total of 50 participants were selected. The rehabilitation and control groups consisted of 25 normally distributed employees each. The rehabilitation group received therapy, whereas the control group had not yet received any form of therapy. IBM SPSS was used to analyze the data collected, and a repeated measures ANOVA, an analysis of covariance, a discriminant analysis, and a construct validity analysis were used to test for reliability and validity. The group was selected from a list of employees within the My-E-Health ecosystem who showed a moderate or high risk for burnout. All assessments and mixed-method CBT were web-based, and floating was conducted at designated locations. The complete EFP assessment was integrated into a digital ecosystem designed for this purpose and therapy, offering a secure and encrypted ecosystem. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between pre- and postassessment scores for burnout. The reliability of the burnout measure was good (Cronbach alpha=.858; mean 1.826, SD 3.008; Cohen d=0.607; P<.001) with a high validity of 0.9420. A paired samples 2-tailed test showed a good t score of 4.292 and P<.001, with a good effect size, Cohen d=0.607. Web-based therapy reduced the risk for burnout in participants compared with the control group. Tests of between-subject effects show F=16.964, a significant difference between the control group and the web-based therapy group: P<.001, with movement between the group variables of 0.261 or 26.1% for the dependent variable. Conclusions: This study suggests good reliability and validity of using web-based interventional mixed methods CBT to reduce the risk of burnout.

The Effectiveness of a Psychoeducation Intervention delivered via WhatsApp for mothers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A randomized controlled trial,Good,"Hemdi, A; Daley, D",CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT,2017,"BackgroundMothers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) report high levels of stress and lower levels of well-being than parents of typically developing children. Current interventions for ASD typically focus on working with the child rather than delivering strategies to help support parents. ObjectiveTo evaluate the effectiveness of a psychoeducation intervention developed to support mothers of children with ASD in Saudi Arabia. MethodSixty-two mothers (23-52years) of children (26-78months) were recruited to a multisite randomized controlled trials of the intervention. The intervention consisted of one face-to-face session (60min) and four virtual sessions (30min each) delivered using WhatsApp. Parenting stress was the primary outcome, with secondary outcomes focusing on maternal depression, anxiety, and happiness, and child behaviour problems and ASD symptoms. Data were collected at baseline T1, immediately postintervention T2 and 8-week follow-up T3. ResultsOne-way analysis of covariance was used at T2 and T3 with T1 scores entered as a covariate. Improvements were found at T2 for stress (F=234.34, p=.00, and d=-1.52) and depression (F=195.70, p=.00, and d=-2.14) but not anxiety, and these results were maintained at T3. Changes in child behaviour problems were limited to improvements in hyperactivity at T2 (F=133.66, p=.00, and d=-1.54). Although changes in stress and depression were statistically significant, change to clinically normal levels was limited to depression. None of the participants had recovered after the intervention (Parent Stress Index Short Form stress scores), whereas 23 mothers (71.87%) in the intervention group had recovered at T2 and 22 (68.75%) at T3 (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression scores).

In many countries, resources to help mothers and infants are limited. Online group-based nurse-led interventions have the potential to help address this problem by providing large numbers of mothers with access to professional and peer support during the postnatal period. Objective: This study tested the effectiveness of a 4-month online group-based nurse-led intervention delivered when infants were aged 2 to 6 months as compared with standard care outcomes. Methods: The study was a block randomized control trial. Mothers were recruited at the time they were contacted for the postnatal health check offered to all mothers in South Australia. Those who agreed to participate were randomly assigned to the intervention or standard care. The overall response rate was 63.3% (133/210). Primary outcomes were the level of maternal depressive symptoms assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and quality of maternal caregiving assessed using the Parenting Stress Index (PSI; competence and attachment subscales), the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSCS), and the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Scale. Assessments were completed at baseline (mean child age 4.9 weeks [SD 1.4]) and again when infants were aged 8 and 12 months. Results: Outcomes were evaluated using linear generalized estimating equations adjusting for postrandomization group differences in demographic characteristics and the outcome score at baseline. There were no significant differences in the intervention and standard care groups in scores on the PSI competence subscale (P=.69) nor in the PSCS (P=.11). Although the group by time interaction suggested there were differences over time between the EPDS and PSI attachment subscale scores in the intervention and standard care groups (P=.001 and P=.04, respectively), these arose largely because the intervention group had stable scores over time whereas the standard care group showed some improvements between baseline and 12 months. Mothers engaged well with the intervention with at least 60% (43/72) of mothers logging-in once per week during the first 11 weeks of the intervention. The majority of mothers also rated the intervention as helpful and user-friendly. Conclusions: Mothers reported that the intervention was helpful, and the app was described as easy to use. As such, it appears that support for mothers during the postnatal period, provided using mobile phone technology, has the potential to be an important addition to existing services. Possible explanations for the lack of differences in outcomes for the 2 groups in this study are the failure of many mothers to use key components of the intervention and residual differences between the intervention and standard care groups post randomization.",10.2196/13689,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,mobile phone; infant; mother-child relations; postnatal depression; randomized controlled trial,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/13689)

Outcomes included mainly measures of cognition, psychosocial functioning, caregiving processes, caregiver-care receiver relationship, and activities of daily living. Positive effects of cognitive training technologies were observed on cognitive functioning of older adults, as well as those of supportive web platforms on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and caregiver self-efficacy. The effects of these solutions on depression in both target groups were inconclusive. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate to good.

This may adversely affect the individual's ability to live his or her life in the way that is desired. Cognitive conditions constitute a group of chronic diseases that predominantly affects older people. Recent technology advancements can help support the day-to-day living activities at home for people with cognitive impairments. Objective: A digital platform (Support Monitoring and Reminder for Mild Dementia; SMART4MD) is created to improve or maintain the quality of life for people with mild cognitive impairment (PwMCI) and their carers. The platform will provide reminders, information, and memory support in everyday life, with the purpose of giving structure and lowering stress. In the trial, we will include participants with a diagnosed neurocognitive disorder as well as persons with an undiagnosed subjective memory problem and cognitive impairment, that is, 20 to 28 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination. Methods: A pragmatic, multicenter RCT is being conducted in Spain, Sweden, and Belgium. The targets for recruitment are 1200 dyads-split into an intervention group and a control group that are in usual care. Intervention group participants will be provided with a data-enabled computer tablet with the SMART4MD app. Its core functionalities, intended to be used daily at home, are based on reminders, cognitive supporting activities, and sharing health information. Results: Inclusion of participants started in December 2017, and recruitment is expected to end in February 2019. Furthermore, there will be 3 follow-up visits at 6, 12, and 18 months after the baseline visit. Conclusions: This RCT is expected to offer benefits at several levels including in-depth knowledge of the possibilities of introducing a holistic multilayered information and communication technology solution for this group. SMART4MD has been developed in a process involving the structured participation of PwMCI, their informal carers, and clinicians. The adoption of SMART4MD faces the challenge of this age group's relative unfamiliarity with digital devices and services. However, this challenge can also be an opportunity for developing a digital device tailored to a group at risk of digital exclusion. This research responds to the wider call for the development of digital devices which are accessible and affordable to older people and this full scale RCT can hopefully serve as a model for further studies in this field.",10.2196/13711,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",dementia; mild cognitive impairment; tablet; app; carer; eHealth; mHealth,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/13711)
The Efficacy of Digital Help for Divorced Danes: Randomized Controlled Trial of Cooperation After Divorce (CAD) and Sick Days,Not Multi User,"Sander, S; Strizzi, JM; Cipric, A; Overup, CS; Hald, GM",CONTEMPORARY FAMILY THERAPY,2024,"Few digital divorce interventions have undergone rigorous randomized control trial study (RCT) testing of their physical and psychological health effects. This paper describes the Cooperation after Divorce (CAD) intervention including background, target group, design and engagement strategies, intervention development, content, and theoretical cornerstones. The 17-module digital psychoeducational intervention addresses three main content areas: (1) the divorcee themselves, (2) the children, and (3) co-parenting. The content of the modules provided psychoeducation and therapeutic activities focused on the maladaptive interactional patterns between former partners and how to develop new interactional schemas, including a focus on when and how to communicate with the former partner in a way that does not escalate conflict. A randomized controlled trial (N = 778) assessed the effect of CAD in terms of number of sick days. Participants were assessed at 3-, 6- and 12-month post-divorce. Independent samples t test revealed that participants in the intervention group on average reported 5.82 fewer sick days one year post-divorce than did participants in the control condition.

Now more than ever, there is an urgent need for scalable, evidence-based interventions to support mental well-being. Objective: The aim of this proof-of-principle study was to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile-based app in adults with self-reported symptoms of anxiety and stress in a randomized control trial that took place during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Methods: Adults with mild to severe anxiety and moderate to high levels of perceived stress were randomized to either the intervention or control arm. Participants in the intervention arm were given access to the Foundations app for the duration of the 4-week study. All participants were required to self-report a range of validated measures of mental well-being (10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience scale [CD-RISC-10], 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7], Office of National Statistics Four Subjective Well-being Questions [ONS-4], World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index [WHO-5]) and sleep (Minimal Insomnia Scale [MISS]) at baseline and at weeks 2 and 4. The self-reported measures of perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Score [PSS-10]) were obtained weekly. Results: A total of 136 participants completed the study and were included in the final analysis. The intervention group (n=62) showed significant improvements compared to the control group (n=74) on measures of anxiety, with a mean GAD-7 score change from baseline of -1.35 (SD 4.43) and -0.23 (SD 3.24), respectively (t(134)=1.71, P=.04); resilience, with a mean change in CD-RISC score of 1.79 (SD 4.08) and -0.31 (SD 3.16), respectively (t(134)=-3.37, P <.001); sleep, with a mean MISS score change of -1.16 (SD 2.67) and -0.26 (SD 2.29), respectively (t(134)=2.13, P=.01); and mental well-being, with a mean WHO-5 score change of 1.53 (SD 5.30) and -0.23 (SD 4.20), respectively (t(134)=-2.16, P=.02), within 2 weeks of using Foundations, with further improvements emerging at week 4. Perceived stress was also reduced within the intervention group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance relative to the control group, with a PSS score change from baseline to week 2 of -2.94 (SD 6.84) and -2.05 (SD 5.34), respectively (t(134)= 0.84, P=.20). Conclusions: This study provides a proof of principle that the digital mental health app Foundations can improve measures of mental well-being, anxiety, resilience, and sleep within 2 weeks of use, with greater effects after 4 weeks.

Due to technological advancements, individually tailored therapy and online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are on the rise. Objective: This study analyzed the efficacy of a smartphone app based on third-wave CBT tailored to an individual. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 126 participants who were divided into 2 groups. The intervention group used the smartphone app BetterLife for 10 weeks, while the control group was placed on a waiting list for the same duration. The Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS), Korean Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-9 (UWES), World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were administered at baseline and after 10 weeks to both groups. Results: Of the 126 participants, 11 dropped out during the trial. A 2-way repeated measure analysis of covariance was conducted, controlling for baseline BDI.

Objective: Our aim was to examine the potential effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of delivering an evidence-based Electronic Cardio-Metabolic Program (eCMP) for improving health-related quality of life, improving health behaviors, and reducing cardiometabolic risk factors in ambulatory care high-risk adults. Methods: We conducted a randomized, wait-list controlled trial with 74 adults aged >= 18 years recruited from a large multispecialty health care organization. Inclusion criteria were (1) BMI >= 35 kg/m(2) and prediabetes, previous gestational diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome, or (2) BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) and type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. Participants had a mean age of 59.7 years (SD 11.2), BMI 37.1 kg/m(2) (SD 5.4) and were 59.5% female, 82.4% white. Participants were randomized to participate in eCMP immediately (n= 37) or 3 months later (n= 37). eCMP is a 6-month program utilizing video conferencing, online tools, and pre-recorded didactic videos to deliver evidence-based curricula. Blinded outcome assessments were conducted at 3 and 6 months postbaseline. Data were collected and analyzed between 2014 and 2015. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes included biometric cardiometabolic risk factors (eg, body weight), self-reported diet and physical activity, mental health status, retention, session attendance, and participant satisfaction. Results: Change in quality of life was not significant in both immediate and delayed participants. Both groups significantly lost weight and reduced waist circumference at 6 months, with some cardiometabolic factors trending accordingly. Significant reduction in self-reported anxiety and perceived stress was seen in the immediate intervention group at 6 months. Retention rate was 93% at 3 months and 86% at 6 months post-baseline. Overall eCMP attendance was high with 59.5-83.8% of immediate and delayed intervention participants attending 50% of the virtual stress management and behavioral lifestyle sessions and 37.8-62.2% attending at least 4 out of 7 in-person physical activity sessions.

The Emerging Imperative for a Consensus Approach Toward the Rating and Clinical Recommendation of Mental Health Apps,Good,"Torous, J; Firth, J; Huckvale, K; Larsen, ME; Cosco, TD; Carney, R; Chan, S; Pratap, A; Yellowlees, P; Wykes, T; Keshavan, M; Christensen, H",JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE,2018,"With over 10,000 mental health- and psychiatry-related smartphone apps available today and expanding, there is a need for reliable and valid evaluation of these digital tools. However, the updating and nonstatic nature of smartphone apps, expanding privacy concerns, varying degrees of usability, and evolving interoperability standards, among other factors, present serious challenges for app evaluation. In this article, we provide a narrative review of various schemes toward app evaluations, including commercial app store metrics, government initiatives, patient-centric approaches, point-based scoring, academic platforms, and expert review systems. We demonstrate that these different approaches toward app evaluation each offer unique benefits but often do not agree to each other and produce varied conclusions as to which apps are useful or not.

The Impact of Explanations on Layperson Trust in Artificial Intelligence-Driven Symptom Checker Apps: Experimental Study,Not Multi User,"Woodcock, C; Mittelstadt, B; Busbridge, D; Blank, G",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2021,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven symptom checkers are available to millions of users globally and are advocated as a tool to deliver health care more efficiently. To achieve the promoted benefits of a symptom checker, laypeople must trust and subsequently follow its instructions. In AI, explanations are seen as a tool to communicate the rationale behind black-box decisions to encourage trust and adoption. However, the effectiveness of the types of explanations used in AI-driven symptom checkers has not yet been studied. Explanations can follow many forms, including why-explanations and how-explanations. Social theories suggest that why-explanations are better at communicating knowledge and cultivating trust among laypeople. Objective: The aim of this study is to ascertain whether explanations provided by a symptom checker affect explanatory trust among laypeople and whether this trust is impacted by their existing knowledge of disease. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 750 healthy participants was conducted. The participants were shown a video of a chatbot simulation that resulted in the diagnosis of either a migraine or temporal arteritis, chosen for their differing levels of epidemiological prevalence. These diagnoses were accompanied by one of four types of explanations. Each explanation type was selected either because of its current use in symptom checkers or because it was informed by theories of contrastive explanation. Exploratory factor analysis of participants' responses followed by comparison-of-means tests were used to evaluate group differences in trust. Results: Depending on the treatment group, two or three variables were generated, reflecting the prior knowledge and subsequent mental model that the participants held. When varying explanation type by disease, migraine was found to be nonsignificant (P=.65) and temporal arteritis, marginally significant (P=.09). Varying disease by explanation type resulted in statistical significance for input influence (P=.001), social proof (P=.049), and no explanation (P=.006), with counterfactual explanation (P=.053). The results suggest that trust in explanations is significantly affected by the disease being explained. When laypeople have existing knowledge of a disease, explanations have little impact on trust. Where the need for information is greater, different explanation types engender significantly different levels of trust. These results indicate that to be successful, symptom checkers need to tailor explanations to each user's specific question and discount the diseases that they may also be aware of. Conclusions: System builders developing explanations for symptom-checking apps should consider the recipient's knowledge of a disease and tailor explanations to each user's specific need. Effort should be placed on generating explanations that are personalized to each user of a symptom checker to fully discount the diseases that they may be aware of and to close their information gap.",10.2196/29386,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,symptom checker; chatbot; artificial intelligence; explanations; trust; knowledge; clinical communication; mHealth; digital health; eHealth; conversational agent; virtual health care; symptoms; diagnostics; mobile phone,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/29386)
The Impact of Optimism and Pain Interference on Response to Online Behavioral Treatment for Mood and Anxiety Symptoms,Good,"Morone, NE; Herbeck, BB; Huang, Y; Abebe, KZ; Rollman, BL; Jonassaint, CR",PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE,2021,"Objective: This study aimed to explore a) if high pain interference has a negative effect on response to computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) for anxiety and depression and b) whether high optimism can buffer the negative effects of pain interference on cCBT outcomes. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of data on 403 participants from the randomized controlled clinical trial Online Treatment for Mood and Anxiety Disorders in Primary Care. It examined the impact of cCBT, with and without access to an Internet support group, on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), mood, and anxiety symptoms. Results: High versus low pain interference had a negative effect on response to cCBT for physical HRQoL regardless of high or low optimism level (between group difference = -3.46 [-5.89 to -1.03],p = .005, or -4.06 [-6.28 to -1.85],p < .001, respectively). However, in the context of low optimism/high pain interference only negatively impacted the effect of cCBT on mental HRQoL (3.68 [0.63 to 6.73], p = .018) and anxiety symptoms (-2.61 [-4.87 to -0.35], p = .024). Although the pattern of effects was similar for depressive symptoms, the between-group differences were not significant. Conclusions: High optimism may buffer against the negative effects of pain interference on treatment response from cCBT. Primary care patients who report high pain interference yet also lack optimism may not receive as much benefit from cCBT as other groups. Furthermore, this study found an unexpected positive effect of low optimism on treatment response.

Methods: We performed a single-center, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, controlled trial. This trial enrolled women between 20 and 60 years of age with stage 0 to III breast cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, and the capability of using their own smartphone apps. From January 7, 2019, to April 17, 2020, a total of 2,616 patients were consecutively screened for eligibility after breast cancer surgery.

The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Genitourinary Cancer Care: Re-envisioning the Future,Good,"Wallis, CJD; Catto, JWF; Finelli, A; Glaser, AW; Gore, JL; Loeb, S; Morgan, TM; Morgans, AK; Mottet, N; Neal, R; O'Brien, T; Odisho, AY; Powles, T; Skolarus, TA; Smith, AB; Szabados, B; Klaassen, Z; Spratt, DE",EUROPEAN UROLOGY,2020,"Context: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated rapid changes in medical practice. Many of these changes may add value to care, creating opportunities going forward. Objective: To provide an evidence-informed, expert-derived review of genitourinary cancer care moving forward following the initial COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence acquisition: A collaborative narrative review was conducted using literature published through May 2020 (PubMed), which comprised three main topics: reduced in-person interactions arguing for increasing virtual and image-based care, optimisation of the delivery of care, and the effect of COVID-19 in health care facilities on decision-making by patients and their families. Evidence synthesis: Patterns of care will evolve following the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine, virtual care, and telemonitoring will increase and could offer broader access to multidisciplinary expertise without increasing costs. Comprehensive and integrative telehealth solutions will be necessary, and should consider patients' mental health and access differences due to socioeconomic status. Investigations and treatments will need to maximise efficiency and minimise health care interactions. Solutions such as one stop clinics, day case surgery, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and oral or less frequent drug dosing will be preferred. The pandemic necessitated a triage of those patients whose treatment should be expedited, delayed, or avoided, and may persist with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in circulation. Patients whose demographic characteristics are at the highest risk of complications from COVID-19 may re-evaluate the benefit of intervention for less aggressive cancers. Clinical research will need to accommodate virtual care and trial participation. Research dissemination and medical education will increasingly utilise virtual platforms, limiting in-person professional engagement; ensure data dissemination; and aim to enhance patient engagement. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic will have lasting effects on the delivery of health care. These changes offer opportunities to improve access, delivery, and the value of care for patients with genitourinary cancers but raise concerns that physicians and health administrators must consider in order to ensure equitable access to care. Patient summary: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the care provided to many patients with genitourinary cancers. This has necessitated a transition to telemedicine, changes in threshold or delays in many treatments, and an opportunity to reimagine patient care to maintain safety and improve value moving forward.

The Importance of Activating Factors in Physical Activity Interventions for Older Adults Using Information and Communication Technologies: Systematic Review,Not mental health,"Bentlage, E; Nyamadi, JJ; Dubbeldam, R",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2023,"Background: In an aging population, it is important to activate older adults in taking care of their own health. Increasing physical activity is one way to avoid or lessen age-related physical and mental impairments. Interest in the use of information and communication technology (ICT) tools to promote physical activity among older adults is growing considerably. Such tools are suitable for communicating activation factors-skills, knowledge, and motivation-by integrating a variety of behavior change techniques (BCTs) to enhance physical activity. Although activation factors have been incorporated into physical activity interventions using ICT, little is known about the actual integration methods used in such interventions or about the effects of activation factors on influencing behavior change.Objective: The first aim of this study was to identify which of the activation factors were covered in physical activity-promoting ICT interventions for older adults and which BCTs were used to address them. The second objective was to classify the user interaction interfaces and delivery modes that were used to promote these activation factors.Methods: The search engines of PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect were used to search for and identify articles examining the effectiveness of ICT interventions for promoting physical activity in older adults. References and related data were selected, extracted, and reviewed independently by 2 reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed, and any conflict was addressed by a third separate reviewer. Selected articles included older adults aged >= 55 years without pre-existing medical diseases and other physical or mental conditions that could hinder movement.Results: In total, 368 records were retrieved, and 13 studies met all inclusion criteria. Articles differed in terms of themes, timescales, user interaction interfaces, and outcome measures; therefore, a quantitative data synthesis was not feasible. Motivation was the most promoted activation factor among all trials (33 times). An app and a smartwatch were used in the majority of intervention groups (7/20, 35%) for tracking physical activity and receiving personalized feedback based on the individual goals. Skills (25 times) and knowledge (17 times) were the next most commonly addressed activation factors. Face-to-face interaction was the most used approach to targeting users' skills, including providing instructions on how to perform a behavior and exchanging knowledge via education on the health consequences of insufficient physical activity. Overall, integrating all 3 activation factors and using multiple user interaction interfaces with a variety of delivery modes proved the most effective in improving physical activity. Conclusions: This study highlights commonly used BCTs and preferred modes of their delivery. So far, only a limited number of available BCTs (21/99, 21%) have been integrated. Considering their effectiveness, a larger variety of BCTs that address skills, knowledge, and motivation should be exploited in future ICT interventions.",10.2196/42968,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,older adults; information and communication technology; healthy aging; activation factors; skills; knowledge; motivation; behavior change techniques; physical activity,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/42968)

The intervention can be availed via in-person and telephonic sessions, and it has been recently developed as an individualized, customizable mobile app. Objective: We examined the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of the Life Goals self-management app among individuals diagnosed with BD who used the app for up to 6 months. Methods: A total of 28 individuals with BD used the Life Goals app on their personal smartphone for 6 months. They completed key clinical outcome measurements of functioning, disability, and psychiatric symptoms at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, in addition to a poststudy survey about usability and satisfaction. Results: Participants used the app for a median of 25 times (IQR 13-65.75), and for a longer time during the first 3 months of the study. The modules on depression and anxiety were the most frequently used, accounting for 35% and 22% of total usage, respectively. Overall, the study participants found the app useful (15/25, 60%) and easy to use (18/25, 72%), and they reported that the screen displayed the material adequately (22/25, 88%). However, less than half of the participants found the app helpful in managing their health (10/25, 40%) or in making progress on their wellness goals (9/25, 36%). Clinical outcomes showed a trend for improvements in mental and physical health and mania-related well-being. Conclusions: The Life Goals app showed feasibility of use among individuals with BD. Higher user engagement was observed in the initial 3 months with users interested more frequently in the mood modules than other wellness modules.

The Mediating Role of General and Cognitive Stress on the Effect of an App-Based Intervention on Productivity Measures in Workers: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"de Miquel, C; Moneta, MV; Weber, S; Lorenz, C; Olaya, B; Haro, JM",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Loss of productivity is a result of absence from work (absenteeism) or of working with limitations due to illness (presenteeism). Recently, occupational mental health interventions have increasingly been delivered in digital format, as this is thought to be more convenient, flexible, easily accessible, and anonymous. However, the effectiveness of electronic mental health (e-mental health) interventions in the workplace to improve presenteeism and absenteeism remains unknown, and could be potentially mediated by psychological variables such as stress levels. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an e-mental health intervention to reduce absenteeism and presenteeism in employees, as well as to investigate the mediating role of stress in this effect. Methods: Employees of six companies in two countries participated in a randomized controlled trial (n=210 in the intervention group and n=322 in the waitlist control group). Participants in the intervention group could use the Kelaa Mental Resilience app for 4 weeks. All participants were asked to complete assessments at baseline, during the intervention, postintervention, and at a 2-week follow-up. Absenteeism and presenteeism were assessed by means of the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health, while general and cognitive stress were assessed through the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire-Revised Version. Regression and mediation analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of the Kelaa Mental Resilience app on presenteeism and absenteeism. Results: The intervention did not have a direct effect on presenteeism or absenteeism, neither at postintervention nor at follow-up. Nevertheless, general stress significantly mediated the intervention effect on presenteeism (P=.005) but not on absenteeism (P=.92), and cognitive stress mediated the effect of the intervention on both presenteeism (P<.001) and absenteeism (P=.02) right after the intervention. At the 2-week follow-up, the mediating effect of cognitive stress on presenteeism was significant (P=.04), although this was not the case for its mediating effect on absenteeism (P=.36). Additionally, at the 2-week follow-up, general stress did not mediate the intervention effect on presenteeism (P=.25) or on absenteeism (P=.72). Conclusions: While no direct effect of the e-mental health intervention on productivity was found in this study, our findings suggest that stress reduction could mediate the effect of the intervention on presenteeism and absenteeism. As such, e-mental health interventions that address stress in employees might also indirectly reduce presenteeism and absenteeism in these employees. However, due to study limitations such as an overrepresentation of female participants in the sample and a high proportion of attrition, these results should be interpreted with caution. Future research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of interventions on productivity in the workplace.",10.2196/42317,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,e-mental health intervention; work; absenteeism; presenteeism; stress; mediation,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/42317)
The Momentum trial: the efficacy of using a smartphone application to promote patient activation and support shared decision making in people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia in outpatient treatment settings: a randomized controlled single-blind trial,Other,"Vitger, T; Austin, SF; Petersen, L; Tonder, ES; Nordentoft, M; Korsbek, L",BMC PSYCHIATRY,2019,"BackgroundShared decision making (SDM) is often defined as an interactive process that ensures that both patient and practitioner are actively involved in the treatment and that they share all relevant information to arrive at a mental health decision. Previous SDM interventions have found improvements in outcomes such as personal recovery, higher perceived involvement in treatment decisions and knowledge about one's disease. Still, SDM occurs less frequently in mental health care than in primary care. Electronic aids developed to support patient activation and SDM could be a promising mean to engage patients in their mental healthcare.The aim of this trial is to investigate the effects of using a smartphone app to promote patient activation and support SDM for people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders in an outpatient treatment setting.MethodsThis randomised controlled trial will allocate participants to one of two groups: (1) Intervention group: smartphone app and TAU (treatment as usual) or (2) Control group: TAU without the smartphone app. A total sample size of 260 people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorder will be recruited from five OPUS teams (a specialized early intervention program) in Denmark between 2019 and 2020. The intervention will last for 6months with data collection at baseline, and at 3 and 6months. Primary outcome will be self-perceived patient activation. Secondary outcomes will be feeling of being prepared for SDM; self-efficacy; working alliance; treatment satisfaction; positive and negative symptoms; level of functioning; hope; and perceived efficacy in patient-provider interaction. Patients' and health providers' preferences in clinical decision making will be assessed. Patients' usage and perceived usefulness of the app will be explored.DiscussionThis study will investigate the efficacy of using the smartphone app to support people with severe mental illness in engaging in their own healthcare management. The study may provide evidence to the idea that linking client and practitioner in digital solutions can have advantages in facilitating SDM in mental health.

The PTSD Family Coach App in Veteran Family Members: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"van Stolk-Cooke, K; Wielgosz, J; Hallenbeck, HW; Chang, A; Rosen, C; Owen, J; Kuhn, E",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among US military veterans can adversely impact their concerned significant others (CSOs; eg, family members and romantic partners). Mobile apps can be tailored to support CSO mental health through psychoeducation, coping skills, and stress monitoring.Objective: This study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of PTSD Family Coach 1.0, a free, publicly available app that includes psychoeducation, stress management tools, self-assessments, and features for connecting to alternative supports, compared with a psychoeducation-only version of the app for cohabitating CSOs of veterans with PTSD.Methods: A total of 200 participants with an average age of 39 (SD 8.44) years, primarily female (193/200, 97%), and White (160/200, 80%) were randomized to self-guided use of either PTSD Family Coach 1.0 (n=104) or a psychoeducation-only app (n=96) for 4 weeks. Caregiver burden, stress, depression, anxiety, beliefs about treatment, CSO self-efficacy, and relationship functioning assessed using measures of dyadic adjustment, social constraints, and communication danger signs were administered via a web survey at baseline and after treatment. User satisfaction and app helpfulness were assessed after treatment. Data were analyzed using linear mixed methods.Results: Overall, 50.5% (101/200) of randomized participants used their allocated app. Participants found PTSD Family Coach 1.0 somewhat satisfying (mean 4.88, SD 1.11) and moderately helpful (mean 2.99, SD 0.97) to use. Linear mixed effects models revealed no significant differences in outcomes by condition for caregiver burden (P=.45; Cohen d=0.1, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.4), stress (P=.64; Cohen d=0.1, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.6), depression (P=.93; Cohen d= 0.0, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.3), anxiety (P=.55; Cohen d=-0.1, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.2), beliefs about treatment (P=.71; Cohen d=0.1, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.3), partner self-efficacy (P=.59; Cohen d=-0.1, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.2), dyadic adjustment (P=.08; Cohen d=-0.2, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.0), social constraints (P=.05; Cohen d=0.3, 95% CI 0.0-0.6), or communication danger signs (P=.90; Cohen d=-0.0, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.3). Post hoc analyses collapsing across conditions revealed a significant between-group effect on stress for app users versus nonusers (beta=-3.62; t281=-2.27; P=.02). Conclusions: Approximately half of the randomized participants never used their allocated app, and participants in the PTSD Family Coach 1.0 condition only opened the app approximately 4 times over 4 weeks, suggesting limitations to this app version's feasibility. PTSD Family Coach 1.0 users reported moderately favorable impressions of the app, suggesting preliminary acceptability. Regarding efficacy, no significant difference was found between PTSD Family Coach 1.0 users and psychoeducation app users across any outcome of interest. Post hoc analyses suggested that app use regardless of treatment condition was associated with reduced stress. Further research that improves app feasibility and establishes efficacy in targeting the domains most relevant to CSOs is warranted.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02486705; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02486705",10.2196/42053,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,posttraumatic stress disorder; PTSD; veterans; family; mobile apps,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/42053)

The Psychosocial Effects of Lockdown Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children in 2021,Other,"Anand, P; Patil, RS; Puri, P; Patil, S",CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,2024,"Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic led to a nationwide lockdown that isolated numerous children and adolescents, significantly affecting their mental well-being. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the challenges faced by children during the pandemic and identify the potential contributing factors. Additionally, given the existing concerns surrounding the mental health of female children and adolescents, our study aimed to investigate the presence of sex -based disparities in children's observed emotional and behavioral difficulties during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods Participants in this study were parents of children aged 6-17 years. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted through verbal administration of a validated semi -structured questionnaire, the Parent Report Measure, from June 2021 to August 2021 at a nearby community health center. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic details and utilized the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a screening tool to assess children's emotional and behavioral aspects during the six-month lockdown period. The responses were then analyzed using appropriate statistical tools like SPSS statistics, and cumulative SDQ scores were used to categorize participants. Results Out of the total 280 responses analyzed, the prosocial subscale exhibited the highest number of abnormal responses, 73 (26.1%), followed by conduct (42; 15%), hyperactivity (41; 14.6%), and peer (41; 14.6%) subscales. These results indicated that children displayed decreased empathy towards others, restlessness, fidgetiness, reduced attention span, frequent tantrums, and a preference for solitary activities. Furthermore, there was a significant association between abnormal subscale scores and the sex of children. Females showed a considerably higher prevalence of emotional problems (172; 61.5%) than males. Among the behavioral responses, a more significant proportion of females displayed abnormal scores in the conduct subscale (170; 60.7%), while abnormal hyperactivity scores were more frequently observed among males (178; 63.4%). Regarding the peer problems subscale, the proportion of females was slightly higher than males (150; 53.7%) and nearly equal in the prosocial domain. A more significant proportion of females displayed abnormal scores for overall difficulties 144 (51.5%), indicating a notable sex -based disparity. Conclusion Our findings highlight the pandemic's significant impact on many children's psychological well-being. The results emphasize the need for targeted interventions to address the mental health concerns that arose in this population. The observed disparity in emotional and behavioral difficulties among female children is particularly concerning, highlighting the need for gender -sensitive support and care. Various strategies can be helpful, such as virtual support groups, indoor recreational activities, reduced screen time and excessive news consumption, and effective communication with parents. Furthermore, our study also indicates the need to dive deep into such areas of pediatric research to understand and plan timely interventions.",10.7759/cureus.53614,wos,General & Internal Medicine,covid-19 pandemic; pandemic; public psychiatry; child and adolescent psychiatry; psychosocial stress; covid-19,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.53614)

Through a process of social product adaptation, assistive artifacts become part of occupational therapy and co-evolve with clients. Personal digital fabrication tools enable small user groups to make and share their one-of-a-kind products with the world. This approach opens up new possibilities for disabled people and their caregivers to actively engage with their own skills and challenges. The paper describes a case study of an inclusive participatory design approach, which leads to qualitative occupational experiences within the field of community-based practice. The aim is to show how the process of collaborative designing, making and using artifacts fosters several elements of subject well-being in itself. The starting point of this open design process is a threefold interaction involving industrial designers, patients and occupational therapists within their local product ecology. Co-experience driven design is an intersubjective process that enables all individual stakeholders to work on a common phenomenon in respect of each subjective experience. Participatory prototyping is applied as a mobilization medium that (a) coordinates and (b) motivates design actions towards collaborative well-being equilibriums. This form of artifact-mediated participatory design embodies simultaneously (1) a communication language between all stakeholders that identifies meaningful goals, (2) an explorative process to attain and challenge these goals, (3) a selection of meaningful and engaging prototyping activities and (4) an appropriateness process with local skills and technology.

The Role of Telemedicine in Rural Mental Health Care Around the Globe,Good,"Hand, LJ",TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH,2022,"Purpose: Through a qualitative systematic literature review (n = 12), this article seeks to better understand how telemedicine is used globally to address mental health needs within rural areas. This article highlights common barriers and advantages to providing this type of care, arguing that telemedicine services may be quite impactful in addressing mental health care needs in rural areas, but barriers, risks, and other cultural considerations must be considered when designing and implementing telemental health intervention programs. Methods: A search was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, PsychINFO, Medline, and SocINDEX. The inclusion criteria: (1) studies published between the years 2012 and 2019; (2) studies that met rigorous methodological criteria or analyzed telemedicine programs rigorously with evidence-based approaches; and (3) studies that specifically address or discuss tested telemedicine intervention programs for mental health in rural areas. Twelve articles of the 143 reviewed met the inclusion criteria. Findings: Themes included: (1) advantages (cost-effectiveness; accessibility, feasibility, and addressing disparities; privacy/confidentiality; integrative/collaborative care with primary care providers); (2) barriers and challenges (digital divides and infrastructure; ongoing care); (3) need for evaluation, evidence-based programs, and sustainability; and (4) across-cultural considerations.

Effects of Gamification on Psychological Well-Being of College Students,Not Multi User,"Navarro-Mateos, C; Mora-Gonzalez, J; Pérez-López, IJ",GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL,2024,"Background: College students are particularly susceptible to developing mental health problems. Gamification can be a powerful teaching strategy to favor motivation and behavioral changes for the improvement of psychological well-being.Purpose: To analyze the effect of a 14-week gamification-based physical education teaching program on psychological well-being of college students.Materials and Methods: A total of 112 college students (21.22 +/- 2.55 years) were recruited and assigned to a gamification-based group or a control group. The intervention group participated in a gamification-based program under the framework of STAR WARS science fiction sage. Participants from this group used a mobile app with a countdown timer and the way for them to gain lifetime was by doing physical activity (PA) and formative challenges. The control group did not experience the gamification approach itself as their classes were based on traditional methodology.

The Treatment of Intra-articular Calcaneus Fractures with Severe Soft Tissue Damage with a Hinged External Fixator or Internal Stabilization: Long-term Results,Population,"Besch, L; Waldschmidt, JS; Daniels-Wredenhagen, M; Varoga, D; Mueller, M; Hilgert, RE; Mathiak, G; Oestern, S; Lippross, S; Seekamp, A",JOURNAL OF FOOT & ANKLE SURGERY,2010,"We developed a hinged external fixator for the treatment of dislocated intra-articular calcaneus fractures with severe soft tissue damage. The external fixation was performed with a known external fixator system. The screw insertion points were biomechanically tested by defining a virtual rotation axis through the center of the talus to allow early active motion in the ankle joint. Long-term follow-up was performed after an average of 7.3 years. Results were graded with the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score. Radiographs were reviewed according to Sanders classification. Four open fractures and 33 cases with extremely swollen soft tissue, blisters, or compartment syndromes were treated. In 24 cases (64.9%), the hinged fixator was the final method of treatment (group I). A change to open reduction with internal fixation was performed in 13 fractures (35.1%) when soft tissue problems were minimal (group II). There were no late amputations, osteomyelitis, or malunions. According to Sanders classification, group I consisted of 14 type II, 8 type III, and 2 type IV fractures. Pin loosening or pin infection was seen in 4 cases, but there was no redislocation. The Bohler's angle improved in 43%, gaps in the posterior facet were closed in 41%, and any shortening or deviation of the axis was corrected in 82% of the cases. The AOFAS score for the group averaged 66.5. According to Sanders classification, group II consisted of 8 type II and 5 type III fractures. The Bohler's angle improved in 88%, and gaps in the posterior facet were closed in 87%. Any shortening or deviation of the axis was corrected in 95%, and the AOFAS score averaged 61.3. Significant differences in patient outcome scores between open reduction with internal fixation and hinged fixator were not found. P value was > .05. The hinged external fixator frame can be used in all calcaneus fracture types without soft tissue limitation. The hinged fixator allows early movement in the ankle joint, the risk of infection is minimized, and secondary plate fixation remains possible.

Remote patient monitoring via telehealth may enhance self-management and control of diabetes. A three-arm randomized controlled trial involving 90 participants randomized into two intervention groups and one control group was conducted. The purpose of this study is to test whether the use of a mobile phone-based app, with or without telehealth counseling, could improve HbA1c level, self-management, and health-related quality of life compared with usual care. The two intervention groups received a mobile phone with a self-management app. One intervention group additionally received telehealth counseling delivered by a diabetes specialist nurse for 6 months. All three groups continued to receive the usual care from their provider. The primary outcome is a reduction in HbA1c level. Secondary outcomes are self-management, health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, and lifestyle changes. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate (descriptive, t-test, MANOVA) methods. There was a significant reduction in the HbA1c levels of participants after 3 and 6 months. There was also a significant difference in HbA1c levels between the control and two intervention groups.

The Use of Social Networking Sites in Mental Health Interventions for Young People: Systematic Review,Good,"Ridout, B; Campbell, A",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2018,"Background: The onset of mental health problems peaks between adolescence and young adulthood; however, young people face barriers to treatment and are often reluctant to seek professional help. Many are instead seeking support and information regarding their mental health via the Web, especially via social networking sites (SNSs), and hence, there is a promising opportunity to use SNSs to deliver or integrate with youth-focused online mental health interventions. Previous reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of SNSs for specific disorders in young people; however, none of the reviews have covered the breadth of SNS-based youth mental health interventions available across all mental health issues. Objective: This review aimed to systematically identify available evidence regarding the use of SNS-based interventions to support the mental health of young people aged up to 25 years, to evaluate their effectiveness, suitability, and safety, and identify gaps and opportunities for future research. Methods: The PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched using Medical Subject Headings terms and exploded keywords and phrases. Retrieved abstracts (n= 974) were double screened, yielding 235 articles for screening at the full-text level. Of these, 9 articles met the review inclusion criteria. Given the small number of studies, and the variety of outcome measures used, a quantitative meta-analysis was not possible. Results: The 9 articles (quantitative studies, qualitative studies, and descriptions of the iterative design process) covered 5 separate interventions. Of the 5 interventions, 2 interventions used purpose-built platforms based on the moderated online social therapy (MOST) model, 2 used Facebook, and 1 evaluated a purpose-built mobile app. The 2 MOST interventions targeted specific mental health issues (depression and psychosis), whereas the others focused on improving mental health literacy, social support, and general well-being. Only 3 quantitative studies were identified, and all used a pre-post design (without a control group) to establish proof of concept. Of the outcome variables assessed, there were significant improvements in mental health knowledge and number of depressive symptoms but no improvement in anxiety or psychosis symptoms. Acceptability of and engagement with the SNS platforms were generally high, as were perceptions of usefulness and safety. Moderation by clinical experts was identified as a key component of the more successful interventions. When offered a choice, users showed a preference for mobile apps over Web-based interfaces. Conclusions: The evidence reviewed suggests young people find SNS-based interventions highly usable, engaging, and supportive. However, future studies need to address the current lack of high-quality evidence for their efficacy in reducing mental health symptoms. Given young people are already turning to SNSs to engage in knowledge seeking and peer-to-peer support, SNS-based youth mental health interventions provide an opportunity to address some of the barriers young people face in accessing qualified mental health support and information.",10.2196/12244,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,social media; social networking; mental health; social support; support groups,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/12244)

The Utilization of Nintendo® Wii™ During Burn Rehabilitation: A Pilot Study,Not Multi User,"Yohannan, SK; Tufaro, PA; Hunter, H; Orleman, L; Palmatier, S; Sang, C; Gorga, DI; Yurt, RW",JOURNAL OF BURN CARE & RESEARCH,2012,"The purpose of this study was to demonstrate feasibility and measure outcomes on pain, anxiety, active range of motion (AROM), function, enjoyment, and presence with the adjunctive use of Nintendo (R) Wii (TM) (Nintendo of America Inc., Redmond, WA) during acute burn rehabilitation. Participants were alternated and stratified based on the location of burn into Wii or control treatment groups. Joints of interest with limited AROM were the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle. All participants received three consecutive sessions of passive range of motion and predetermined joint-specific exercises. This was followed by either designated Wii games or therapist-chosen interventions (control). The outcomes were compared between groups using t-tests (P < .05) and Cohen's d statistic. Data from 23 participants aged 20 to 78 years were analyzed. The difference in mean slopes suggested that the Wii group experienced less pain (x = -0.97, P = .07) than the control group over time. Overall, trends with anxiety (x = -0.11, P = .77), AROM (x = 0.55, P = .81), function (x = -0.38, P = .43), and enjoyment (x = 0.09, P = .73) seemed to favor the Wii group. Presence minimally changed between successive treatment sessions for those in the Wii group. Although statistical significance was not reached in any category, feasibility was supported and the overall pattern for outcomes was positive for the Wii group, the most favorable being for pain reduction. Future research with larger sample sizes is warranted to explore best practice with video game technology throughout the continuum of burn rehabilitation with appropriate prescriptions.

The VRIMM study: Virtual Reality for IMMunisation pain in young children-protocol for a randomised controlled trial,Other,"Ellerton, K; Tharmarajah, H; Medres, R; Brown, L; Ringelblum, D; Vogel, K; Dolphin, A; McKellar, S; Bridson, F; John-White, M; Craig, S",BMJ OPEN,2020,"Introduction Pain caused by routine immunisations is distressing to children, their parents and those administering injections. If poorly managed, it can lead to anxiety about future medical procedures, needle phobia and avoidance of future vaccinations and other medical treatment. Several strategies, such as distraction, are used to manage the distress associated with routine immunisations. Virtual reality (VR), a technology which transports users into an immersive 'virtual world', has been used to manage pain and distress in various settings such as burns dressing changes and dental treatments. In this study, we aim to compare the effectiveness of VR to standard care in a general practice setting as a distraction technique to reduce pain and distress in 4-year-old children receiving routine immunisations. Methods and analysis The study is a randomised controlled clinical trial comparing VR with standard care in 100 children receiving routine 4-year-old vaccination. Children attending a single general practice in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia will be allocated using blocked randomisation to either VR or standard care. Children in the intervention group will receive VR intervention prior to vaccination in addition to standard care; the control group will receive standard care. The primary outcome is the difference in the child's self-rated pain scores between the VR intervention and control groups measured using The Faces Pain Scale-Revised. Secondary outcomes include another measure of self-rated pain (the Poker Chip Tool), parent/guardian and healthcare provider ratings of pain (standard 100 mm visual analogue scales) and adverse effects.

The Value of Technology to Support Dyadic Caregiving for Individuals Living With Heart Failure: Qualitative Descriptive Study,Not mental health,"El-Dassouki, N; Pfisterer, K; Benmessaoud, C; Young, K; Ge, KLY; Lohani, R; Saragadam, A; Pham, Q",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2022,"Background: The demand for health services to meet the chronic health needs of the aging population is significant and remains unmet because of the limited supply of clinical resources. Specifically, in managing heart failure (HF), digital health sought to address this gap during the COVID-19 pandemic but highlighted an access issue for those who could not use technology-mediated health care services without the support of their informal caregivers (ICs). The complexity of managing HF symptoms and recurrent exacerbations requires many patients to comanage their illness with their ICs in a care dyad, working together to optimize patient outcomes and health-related quality of life. However, most HF programs have missed the opportunity to consider the dyadic perspective despite interdependencies on HF outcomes. Objective: This study aims to characterize the value of technology in supporting caregiving for individuals living with HF. Methods: Motivated by an observed unique pattern of engagement in patients enrolled in our Medly HF management program at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in Toronto, Canada, we conducted 20 semistructured interviews with a convenience sample of ICs. All interviews were analyzed using the iterative refinement of a codeveloped codebook. The team maintained reflexivity journals to reflect the impact of their positionality on their coding. Themes were first derived deductively using HF typologies (patient-oriented dyads, caregiver-oriented dyads, and collaboratively oriented dyads) and then inductively refined and recategorized based on concepts from the van Houtven et al framework. Results: We believe that there is a need to formally and intentionally expand HF technologies to include dyadic needs and goals. We suggest defining 3 opportunities in which value can be added to technological design. First, identify how technology may be leveraged to increase psychological bandwidth by reducing uncertainty and providing peace of mind. We found that actionable feedback was highly desired by both partners. Second, develop technology that can serve as a member of the dyad's support system. In our experience, automated prompts for patients to take measurements can mimic the support typically provided by ICs and ease their workload. Third, consider how technology can mitigate the dyad's clinical knowledge requirements and learning curve. Our approach includes real-time actionable feedback paired with a human-in-the-loop, nurse-led model of care. Conclusions: Our findings identified a need to focus on improving the dyadic experience as a whole by building IC functionality into digital health self-management interventions. Through a shared model of care that supports the role of the patient in their own HF management, includes ICs to expand and enhance the patient's capacity to care, and acknowledges the need of ICs to care for themselves, we anticipate improved outcomes for both partners.",10.2196/40108,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,heart failure; digital therapeutics; remote patient management; caregiving; dyadic management,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/40108)

The clinical effect of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in subgroups with depressive and anxiety symptoms: A secondary analysis of a randomized-controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Rötger, A; Schuffelen, J; Maurer, LF; Lorenz, N; Pollok, B; Gieselmann, A",JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH,2024,"Insomnia is a highly prevalent mental disorder, and is often co-occurring with depression and anxiety disorders. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia as treatment of choice for insomnia can also be applied digitally (digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia), making it more accessible. This is a secondary data analysis of a two-armed parallel randomized-controlled trial. In the primary publication, N = 238 participants meeting criteria for the 5th edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders chronic insomnia disorder were randomly assigned to either 8 weeks of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia + treatment-as-usual, or waitlist + treatment-as-usual. To determine the clinical effects of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in populations with comorbid anxiety and depression symptoms, this secondary analysis focused on two subgroups: (1) participants with high initial depressive symptoms; and (2) participants with high initial anxiety symptoms. Symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety as primary outcome measures were obtained at baseline, 8 weeks post-randomization and, in the intervention group only, at 6- and 12-months follow-up. At 8 weeks post-randomization, the use of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in both subgroups was associated with large reductions in insomnia severity in comparison to control (depression subgroup: d = 2.37; anxiety subgroup: d = 2.13). Between-group treatment effects were also observed for symptoms of depression in the depression subgroup (d = 1.59), and for symptoms of anxiety in the anxiety subgroup (d = 1.28). Within-group effects were stable over time (d = 0.64-1.63).

The clinical effects of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in a heterogenous study sample: results from a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Schuffelen, J; Maurer, LF; Lorenz, N; Rötger, A; Pietrowsky, R; Gieselmann, A",SLEEP,2023,"Study Objectives Numerous studies worldwide have reported the beneficial effects of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I). However, few focus on real-world study samples that reflect people in regular care. To test whether dCBT-I is suitable within German regular care, we designed a randomized controlled trial recruiting a heterogenous insomnia population.Methods Participants aged >= 18 who met the criteria for insomnia disorder were randomized to 8-weeks dCBT-I + care-as-usual (CAU) or they were set on a waitlist + CAU. The intervention group was followed-up at 6- and 12-months. The primary outcome was self-reported insomnia severity, assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at 8-weeks post-randomization. A one-way ANCOVA with baseline score as a covariate was fitted to determine group differences. Secondary outcomes included measures of daytime functioning, quality of life, depression, anxiety, dreams, and nightmares.Results Of the N = 238 participants (67.6% female), age range 19-81 years, n = 118 were randomized to dCBT-I and n = 120 to the control group. At posttreatment, the use of dCBT-I was associated with a large reduction in the ISI (Diffadj = -7.60) in comparison to WLC (d = -2.08). This clinical improvement was also reflected in responder and remission rates. Treatment effects were also observed for daytime functioning, quality of life, symptoms of depression and anxiety (ds = 0.26-1.02) and at long-term follow-up (intervention group only; ds = 0.18-1.65). No effects were found for dream and nightmare frequency.Conclusions This study showed that dCBT-I reduces insomnia symptoms and improves daytime functioning in a heterogenous insomnia population in Germany with sustained long-term treatment effects in the intervention group. Our results underscore the potential of digital health applications, their suitability within regular care, and their role in facilitating widespread implementation of CBT-I as a first-line treatment for insomnia.

Primary care settings involve high diagnostic uncertainty and limited time and information, creating ideal conditions for diagnostic errors. We report on the design and conduct of Project RedDE, a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized controlled trial of a virtual quality improvement collaborative aimed at reducing diagnostic errors in pediatric primary care. Methods: Project RedDE cluster-randomized pediatric primary care practices into one of three groups. Each group participated in a quality improvement collaborative targeting the same three diagnostic errors (missed diagnoses of elevated blood pressure and adolescent depression and delayed diagnoses of abnormal laboratory studies), but in a different sequence. During the quality improvement collaborative, practices worked both independently and collaboratively, leveraging general quality improvement strategies (e.g. process mapping) in addition to error-specific content (e.g. pocket guides for blood pressure norms) delivered during the intervention phase for each error. The quality improvement collaborative intervention included interactive learning sessions and webinars, quality improvement coaching at the team level, and repeated evaluation of failures via root cause analyses. Pragmatic data were collected monthly, submitted to a centralized data aggregator, and returned to the practices in the form of run charts comparing each practice's progress over time to that of the group. The primary analysis used patients as the unit of analysis and compared diagnostic error proportions between the intervention and baseline periods, while secondary analyses evaluated the sustainability of observed reductions in diagnostic errors after the intervention period ended. Results: A total of 43 practices were recruited and randomized into Project RedDE. Eleven practices withdrew before submitting any data, and one practice merged with another participating practice, leaving 31 practices that began work on Project RedDE. All but one of the diverse, national pediatric primary care practices that participated ultimately submitted complete data. Quality improvement collaborative participation was robust, with an average of 63% of practices present on quality improvement collaborative webinars and 85% of practices present for quality improvement collaborative learning sessions. Complete data included 30 months of outcome data for the first diagnostic error worked on, 24 months of outcome data for the second, and 16 months of data for the third. Lessons learned and limitations: Contamination across study groups was a recurring concern; concerted efforts were made to mitigate this risk. Electronic health records played a large role in teams' success.

We have developed a hybrid off-job crafting intervention to promote off-job crafting, a proactive pursuit to adjust one's off-job time activities to satisfy one's psychological needs. This hybrid intervention contains both on-site (two trainings) and online elements (smartphone app) to enhance employees' well-being and performance within different life domains. Methods The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with an intervention group and a waitlist control group. The study population will be Finnish knowledge workers. The intervention program focuses on six psychological needs (detachment, relaxation, autonomy, mastery, meaning, and affiliation) proposed by the DRAMMA model. The intervention will consist of the following components: 1) an on-site off-job crafting training, 2) an individual off-job crafting plan for the four-week intervention period, 3) Everydaily smartphone app usage, and 4) a training session for reflection. The study outcomes are assessed with online questionnaires once at baseline, weekly during the intervention period and twice after the intervention (two-week and six-week follow-up). Moreover, during the second training session, participants will participate in a process evaluation to shed light on the mechanisms that can affect the effectiveness of the intervention. Discussion We expect that the intervention will stimulate off-job crafting behaviors, which may in turn increase well-being and performance in both non-work and work domains during and after the intervention (compared to baseline and to the control group). The intervention may provide employees with additional resources to deal with various stressors in life.

The effect of Housing First on mobile and digital media usage by people experiencing homelessness: A program evaluation based on a randomized controlled trial in Spain,Not Multi User,"Martínez-Cantos, JL; Martín-Fernández, JA; Panadero, S",MOBILE MEDIA & COMMUNICATION,2023,"In 2014, a non-governmental organization called HOGAR Si initiated the Habitat program as a pioneer attempt to implement the Housing First model in Spain. The present study is part of the evaluation of this program, which was carried out from May 2015 to February 2020 using a form of a randomized controlled trial. The treatment group was compared with a control group (people experiencing homelessness but not selected as Habitat users), keeping track of their evolution over 18 months. Among the many dimensions that were evaluated (coverage of basic needs, life satisfaction, victimization, physical and mental health, etc.), the study analyzed social support and leisure activities involving the use of mobile media and other communication technologies-along similar lines to some previous research. The main results show that participating in the Habitat program brought a few improvements in digital inclusion. That is the case of the higher use of mobile phones to receive calls, to connect to the Internet, or to have contact with relatives, partners, or friends. These gains seem to be significant for the increase in perception of available social support by Habitat users, whereas these changes did not occur in the comparison group to the same extent. Additionally, participating in the program enhances satisfaction with leisure time, as well as the frequency of carrying out some activities such as shopping, watching TV, or doing a pastime or hobby. It could be concluded that the Habitat program achieved significant improvements in areas beyond specific housing services. The positive effects regarding social support and leisure activities seem to be partly channeled through mobile phones and digital applications; nevertheless, we are aware that further research and discussion on the active role of these technologies in helping people experiencing homelessness is still necessary.",10.1177/20501579231216670,wos,Communication,Housing First; homelessness; mobile media; evaluation; randomized controlled trial,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1177/20501579231216670)

Intervention group were provided the MyHeartMate app for 6 months. Co-designed features included an avatar of the patient's heart and tokens earned by risk factor work (tracking, challenges, and quizzes). The control group received usual care. Primary outcome was self-reported physical activity [metabolic equivalents (METs), Global Physical Activity Questionnaire] and secondary outcomes included lipid levels, blood pressure (BP), body mass index, and smoking. Pre-specified sample size was achieved (n = 390), age 61.2 +/- 11.5 years; 82.5% men and 9.2% current smokers. At 6 months, adjusted for baseline levels, the intervention group achieved more physical activity than control (median difference 329 MET mins/wk), which was not statistically significant (95% CI -37.4, 696; P = 0.064). No differences occurred between groups on secondary outcomes except for lower triglyceride levels in the intervention [mean difference -0.3 (95% CI -0.5, -0.1 mmoL/L, P = 0.004)].

The effect of a therapeutic smartphone application on suicidal ideation in young adults: Findings from a randomized controlled trial in Australia,Not Multi User,"Torok, M; Han, J; McGillivray, L; Wong, QY; Werner-Seidler, A; O'Dea, B; Calear, A; Christensen, H",PLOS MEDICINE,2022,"BackgroundSuicidal ideation is a major risk for a suicide attempt in younger people, such that reducing severity of ideation is an important target for suicide prevention. Smartphone applications present a new opportunity for managing ideation in young adults; however, confirmatory evidence for efficacy from randomized trials is lacking. The objective of this study was to assess whether a therapeutic smartphone application ( LifeBuoy ) was superior to an attention-matched control application at reducing the severity of suicidal ideation.Methods and findingsIn this 2-arm parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 455 young adults from Australia experiencing recent suicidal ideation and aged 18 to 25 years were randomly assigned in a 2:2 ratio to use a smartphone application for 6 weeks in May 2020, with the final follow-up in October 2020. The primary outcome was change in suicidal ideation symptom severity scores from baseline (T0) to postintervention (T1) and 3-month postintervention follow-up (T2), measured using the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). Secondary outcomes were symptom changes in depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD-7), distress (Distress Questionnaire-5, DQ5), and well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, SWEMWBS). This trial was conducted online, using a targeted social media recruitment strategy. The intervention groups were provided with a self-guided smartphone application based on dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; LifeBuoy ) to improve emotion regulation and distress tolerance. The control group were provided a smartphone application that looked like LifeBuoy ( LifeBuoy-C ), but delivered general (nontherapeutic) information on a range of health and lifestyle topics. Among 228 participants randomized to LifeBuoy, 110 did not complete the final survey; among 227 participants randomized to the control condition, 91 did not complete the final survey. All randomized participants were included in the intent-to-treat analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes. There was a significant time x condition effect for suicidal ideation scores in favor of LifeBuoy at T1 (p < 0.001, d = 0.45) and T2 (p = 0.007, d = 0.34). There were no superior intervention effects for LifeBuoy on any secondary mental health outcomes from baseline to T1 or T2 [p-values: 0.069 to 0.896]. No serious adverse events (suicide attempts requiring medical care) were reported.The main limitations of the study are the lack of sample size calculations supporting the study to be powered to detect changes in secondary outcomes and a high attrition rate at T2, which may lead efficacy to be overestimated.ConclusionsLifeBuoy was associated with superior improvements in suicidal ideation severity, but not secondary mental health outcomes, compared to the control application, LifeBuoy-C.

The effect of digital reminiscence therapy on people with dementia: a pilot randomized controlled trial,Good,"Moon, S; Park, K",BMC GERIATRICS,2020,"BackgroundReminiscence therapy (RT) can improve various dysfunctions in people with dementia (PWD), but it may not be a cost-effective intervention. Digital RT allows multiple users to participate in a therapy simultaneously. Moreover, digital RT offers convenience, such as for uploading personal materials and presenting individual triggers of personal memories. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the effect of digital RT through a comparison with conventional RT and to develop a strategy for designing larger RCTs.MethodsAn Android application and digital content were developed for digital RT. Overall, 49 PWD enrolled in nine daycare centers in Korea met the inclusion criteria. Eight sessions of digital RT in an intervention group (n=25) and storytelling in a control group (n=24) with no digital materials were performed over 4 weeks from February to June 2019. Cognition, depression, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and engagement were measured as the primary outcomes to evaluate the effect of digital RT. All outcomes except for engagement were evaluated at baseline before the intervention (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 4 weeks after the intervention (T2). Engagement was measured at the first and last intervention sessions. Differences in cognition, depression and BPSD between groups and across time points (T0, T1, and T2) were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Differences in engagement between the groups and time points (the first and last sessions) were analyzed by independent t-tests. This study adhered to the CONSORT guidelines.ResultsDepression (F=7.62, p= .001, partial eta (2)=.17) was significantly decreased at T1 and T2, and engagement (t=-2.71, p=.011) was significantly increased at the last session in the digital RT group compared to the control group. However, cognition (F=0.13, p=.821) and BPSD (F=0.67, p=.485) were not significantly different between groups and time points.ConclusionsDigital RT proved an innovative approach to manage PWD and will thus help PWD achieve a better mood and have more opportunities to engage in social interactions.Trial registrationKCT0003446 in the Clinical Research Information Service.

Perceived social support plays an important role in maintaining people's health and reducing the negative effects of stress caused by the environment and society. The present study was designed and implemented with the purpose of determining the effect of educational intervention based on social support theory in reducing stress caused by the covid-19 pandemic in people with diabetes. Methods: The current investigation was an interventional and semi-experimental study conducted on 212 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Eligible participants were diabetic individuals capable of utilizing virtual platforms and not afflicted with COVID-19. Exclusion criteria encompassed unwillingness to continue study participation, absence from multiple training sessions, and development of a specific illness during the study period. Random allocation placed patients into either the control or intervention group. The intervention group received educational materials via WhatsApp, while the control group did not receive any intervention. The researcher administered a questionnaire to collect demographic information and assess perceived social support among the patients. Data analysis involved the use of chi-square tests, independent and paired t-tests, as well as ANCOVA. Results: This study revealed that the mean age of patients in the control and intervention groups was 46.35 +/- 14.15 and 51.72 +/- 11.57, respectively. Most of the diabetic patients in both groups were female, married, had a diploma, were housekeepers, and had an income between 2 and 5 million Tomans. According to the results obtained in all subscales of social support theory as well as the perceived stress score due to the corona pandemic after the educational intervention, a statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (P < 0.05), so that the score of all subscales of social support theory in the intervention group was higher than the control group. But the perceived stress score caused by Corona in the intervention group was significantly lower than the control group. Conclusion: The results of this study illustrate the noteworthy influence of social support training in lessening perceived stress among patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, healthcare providers are encouraged to integrate social support education programs into comprehensive care initiatives for diabetic patients, particularly during periods of heightened stress like the current coronavirus pandemic.",10.1186/s12889-024-18180-y,wos,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Covid-19; Diabetes; Educational intervention; Perceived stress; Social support,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-024-18180-y)

The effect of music and skin contact with the newborn on pain and anxiety during episiotomy repair in primiparous women: A double-blind randomized controlled study,Not Digital,"Kirca, AS; Gül, DK",EXPLORE-THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND HEALING,2022,"Objective: To show that music medicine and skin contact with the newborns can reduce pain and anxiety during episiotomy repair. Design: Double-blind randomized controlled trial Setting: The study was conducted between April and July 2020 at the private Medipol Nisa Hospital. Participants: A total of 150 primiparous pregnant women over 20 years of age who underwent vaginal delivery with episiotomy Interventions: Participants were randomized into the music medicine, skin contact with the newborn, and control groups (with no treatment). After episiotomy repair (with the designated treatment or no treatment), the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and Visual Analog Scale were used to assess anxiety and pain, respectively. Main outcome measures: Pain and anxiety experienced after episiotomy repair in the treatment and control groups. Results: Women in both treatment groups (music medicine and skin-to-skin contact) had significantly lower anxiety and pain levels than those in the control group. In particular, music medicine significantly reduced pain in comparison to skin contact with the newborn (VAS 2 3.92 +/- 1.46 vs. 5.42 +/- 1.73, respectively, VAS 3 2.64 +/- 1.63 vs. 5.14 +/- 1.77, respectively, VAS 4 1.38 +/- 1.46 vs. 4.14 +/- 2.04, respectively, p < 0.05). Thus, music medicine is more effective than skin-to-skin contact in reducing the pain experienced during episiotomy repair, but both treatments were equally effective in reducing anxiety (35.30 +/- 6.47 vs. 36.82 +/- 9.71 vs. 49.22 +/- 16.95, respectively, p < 0.05). Conclusion: Both of these nonpharmacological treatments can be used along with analgesics and anxiolytics for the treatment of pain and anxiety during episiotomy repair. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The effect of virtual reality therapy and counseling on students' public speaking anxiety,Not Multi User,"Sarpourian, F; Samad-Soltani, T; Moulaei, K; Bahaadinbeigy, K",HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS,2022,"Background and Aims One of the barriers to effective communication between speaker and listeners is public speaking anxiety (PSA). Over recent years, PSA has become common among students as the most widespread social anxiety (SA). Virtual reality (VR) and counseling therapy help reduce PSA. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of VR therapy and counseling on students' PSA and SA. Methods This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 30 students at three levels of undergraduate, postgraduate, and PhD at Kerman University of Medical Sciences and Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (15 students in the intervention group and 15 in the control group). The intervention group observed four virtual classroom scenarios in a 30-min session, and the control group attended a 90-min group counseling session. Data were collected using by Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety, Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, and Igroup Presence Questionnaire. The data analysis was done using SPSS version 21. Descriptive analysis (frequency and percentage, mean, standard deviation, and quartiles) and analytical tests (paired t-test and independent t-test) were used to analyze the data. Results The results showed that VR and counseling did not affect SA scores and statistical differences before and after the intervention were not statistically significant. However, VR and counseling reduced PSA. The mean of IPQ/IGP (physical presence) was 63.73. The participants' SA means (93.76) were higher than the mean PSA (73.4).

The effectiveness and cultural adaptations of psychological interventions for eating disorders in East Asia: A systematic scoping review,Good,"Yim, SH; Schmidt, U",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS,2023,"ObjectiveThere has been no review on eating disorder-focused psychological interventions in East Asia. The aims of this systematic scoping review were to summarize existing and forthcoming studies and to synthesize the cultural adaptations and effectiveness of the interventions identified.MethodFive databases (PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Medline, PsychInfo) and seven trial registries were searched. Studies examining eating disorder (ED)-focused psychological interventions in East Asia were included. Narrative synthesis was used for the analysis.ResultsEighteen published studies and 14 ongoing/completed but unpublished studies were included. Most published studies were uncontrolled and five were feasibility studies. Among the ongoing studies, 71% are randomized controlled trials. Cognitive therapies were the main approach used, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), internet CBT, group CBT, guided self-help, and cognitive remediation therapy. Cultural adaptations were mostly related to language, communication style and tailoring the dietary requirements to local diets. Interventions were shortened to increase acceptability and reduce financial and time burden to patients. Overall, studies showed good acceptability, completion rates and positive effects on ED symptoms (indicated by moderate to large effect sizes or statistical significance).DiscussionStudies were underpowered and uncontrolled, thus precluding meaningful interpretations of effectiveness to be made. However, the psychological interventions were acceptable and showed promise in delivery. Digital and group interventions seemed to be the most feasible given barriers in the local health systems. More controlled studies, as well as studies on children and adolescents, are needed in future.Public significanceThis is the first systematic scoping review examining psychological interventions for eating disorders in East Asia. Research in eating disorders has largely focused on White people and in Western countries. This review will be helpful for clinicians and researchers to understand the current state of the field through a non-Eurocentric lens, to identify gaps and plan future research. ObjetivoResultadosNo se ha realizado ninguna revision sobre las intervenciones psicologicas centradas en los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria en Asia Oriental. Los objetivos de esta revision sistematica fueron resumir los estudios existentes y futuros y sintetizar las adaptaciones culturales y la eficacia de las intervenciones identificadas.MetodoSe realizaron busquedas en cinco bases de datos (PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Medline, PsychInfo) y siete registros de ensayos. Se incluyeron los estudios que examinaban las intervenciones psicologicas centradas en los trastornos de conducta alimentaria (TCA) en Asia Oriental. Para el analisis se utilizo la sintesis narrativa.Se incluyeron 18 estudios publicados y 14 estudios en curso/terminados pero no publicados. La mayoria de los estudios publicados eran no controlados y cinco eran estudios de viabilidad. Entre los estudios en curso, el 71% son ensayos controlados aleatorios. Las terapias cognitivas fueron el principal enfoque utilizado, incluida la terapia cognitivo-conductual (TCC) individual, la TCC por Internet, la TCC grupal, la autoayuda guiada y la terapia de remediacion cognitiva. Las adaptaciones culturales estuvieron relacionadas sobre todo con el idioma, el estilo de comunicacion y la adaptacion de los requisitos dieteticos a las dietas locales. Las intervenciones se acortaron para aumentar la aceptabilidad y reducir la carga economica y de tiempo para los pacientes. En general, los estudios mostraron una buena aceptabilidad, tasas de finalizacion y efectos positivos sobre los sintomas de TCA (indicados por tamanos del efecto de moderados a grandes o significacion estadistica).DiscusionLos estudios no tenian la potencia suficiente y no estaban controlados, lo que impide realizar interpretaciones significativas de la efectividad.

Considering how PM failure decreases individuals' quality of life and functional independence in the activities of daily living, training to enhance this ability could be a prior target of intervention.ObjectiveHere, we aimed to present the study protocol and preliminary results of a novel immersive virtual reality (IVR) and telemedicine-based (TM) cognitive intervention focused on executive abilities (i.e., planning, shifting, and updating) to improve PM functioning in PD-MCI patients and healthy elderly individuals.MethodsOutcome measures, collected before, immediately after and 2 months after the intervention, included: (1) pre-post training changes in objective cognitive functioning, evaluated with tests assessing executive functions and PM; (2) pre-post training changes in subjective perception of memory functioning, psychiatric symptoms, autonomy in daily living and quality of life, evaluated using the appropriate scales; (3) usability, feasibility and users' compliance with the proposed IVR and telemedicine program. The efficacy of this intervention compared to an active control condition is currently being evaluated in a randomized, double-blind controlled trial, which will be conducted on 30 eligible PD-MCI patients and 30 older adults.ResultsPreliminary results concerning between-group comparisons of demographic and neuropsychological screening data show a good balance among the intervention groups considered in this study. The results also suggest good levels of usability, feasibility and acceptability, thus supporting the notion that our intervention can be used to promote cognitive functioning, even in people with cognitive decline.ConclusionConsidering the relatively low costs and easy accessibility to this program, it could prove valuable in primary prevention initiatives and early cognitive rehabilitation for dementia risk reduction.",10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1268337,"pubmed, wos",Psychology,prospective memory; Parkinson's disease; healthy aging; training; immersive virtual reality; telemedicine,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1268337)

This study describes a systematic review and preliminary meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of mobile health (mHealth) interventions, which is defined as the use of portable electronic devices to support public health and medical practice, in addressing depressive symptoms among postpartum women. Methods Databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on PPD from database inception to December 2019. Results The initial search identified 754 studies, of which, 11 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These studies evaluated four types of distinct mHealth interventions and involved 2424 participants across six countries. Pooled results demonstrated that compared to the controls, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score decreased in the mHealth intervention group (mean difference: -1.09, 95% confidence interval: -1.39 to -0.79). Discussion Our study suggested that mHealth interventions may be a promising tool to complement routine clinical care in the prevention and treatment of PPD, but the clinical effectiveness of mHealth interventions needs to be better established. While most studies focused on telephone-based interventions, recent researches have also suggested the superiority and effectiveness of short messaging service (SMS) and smartphone applications, but the exact efficacy needs further evaluation.

Digital divide could impact mental health, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information and communication technology (ICT)-based tools and interventions could effectively provide social support. Intergenerational mentoring between college students and older adults could promote eHealth literacy and self-efficacy, and it is advocated to bridge the digital divide for older adults. However, the effectiveness of an intervention which employs ICT-based tools and intergenerational mentoring strategies (i.e. Digital Buddy) on mental well-being is unclear. Methods This study will employ a multi-centre, cluster-randomized, two-parallel-group, noninferiority, controlled trial design with a 1:1 group allocation ratio. In the intervention group, a Digital Buddy (i.e. a young volunteer) is assigned to a group of older adults in a 1:10 ratio. A series of training sessions for a minimum of 23 h will be provided to the older adults by Digital Buddy, who will also follow through the intervention period with the older participants.

Silver sulfadiazine is the gold standard in topical burn treatment but was associated with toxicity to keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which may delay wound healing. In discovering potential alternative treatments for burn wound healing, this study was performed to determine the effect of Labisia Pumila (Blume) Fern.-Vill. Var. Alata (LPVa) extract on thermal-burn wounds in rats. Methods: A total of 50 Sprague-Dawley male rats were categorized into five groups. There were three control groups; normal control (left untreated), negative control (given ointment base) and positive control (given silver sulfadiazine). Meanwhile, the two intervention groups were given with 2% LPVa leaf and root extracts, respectively. Burn wounds were inflicted on the loin region of the rat by applying a heated steel rod at 80 & DEG;C for 10 s. On days 3, 7, 14, and 21, wounds were measured macroscopically using a digital calliper and one animals of each group were sacrificed, and the wounded skin were excised for histomorphological assessments. The wounds were excised for hydroxyproline content on Day 14 of treatment. Result: For wound contraction percentage, both the leaf and root extracts of LPVa showed a significant reduction in burn wound size on Day 7 onwards, when compared to other groups. For hydroxyproline content, only the leaf extract of LPVa produced significantly higher content compared to both negative and normal control groups. In terms of histological examination, the leaf extract group demonstrated a superior healing effect than the root extract group.

"The effects of massage and music on pain, anxiety and relaxation in burn patients: Randomized controlled clinical trial",Not Multi User,"Ghezeljeh, TN; Ardebili, FM; Rafii, F",BURNS,2017,"Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of massage and music on pain intensity, anxiety intensity and relaxation level in burn patients. Introduction: Pain and anxiety are common among bum patients, but there are many physical and psychological consequences. Methods: This randomized controlled clinical trial with factorial design 2 x 2 included 240 bum patients admitted at Shahid Motahari Bums Hospital, Tehran, Iran, between September 2013 and May 2015. The patients were allocated into the following groups: (i) control (n=60) receiving the conventional primary care, (ii) music group (n=60) receiving their favorite songs, (iii) massage group (n=60) receiving Swedish massage, and (iv) music plus-massage group (n=60) receiving a combination of their favorite songs and Swedish massage, for 20min once a day for 3 consecutive days, using random permuted blocks of sizes 4 with a 1:1 ratio. To collect the data before and after the intervention, a specific Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was applied for pain intensity, anxiety intensity, and relaxation level. The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 21. Results: Our findings showed a decrease in pain and anxiety intensity and an increase in relaxation level in all three intervention groups as compared to the control group, indicating there was no significant difference among the interventions applied. Furthermore, following application of each intervention, pain and anxiety intensity decreased and relaxation level increased in the intervention groups as compared to before intervention. Conclusion: Our results revealed that music, massage and a combination of both interventions were effective on reducing pain and anxiety intensity and increasing relaxation level. Due to easy, low-cost and availability of the interventions applied, these complementary therapies are suggested for the bum patients. Although application of a single complementary therapy is cost-effective, further studies are required to determine the most effective and cost-effective method to improve the bum care.

The ADVANCE group intervention for men in substance use treatment is tailored to address substance use and IPA in an integrated way. In a feasibility trial pre-COVID, men who received the ADVANCE intervention via face-to-face group delivery showed reductions in IPA perpetration. Due to COVID-19, ADVANCE was adapted for remote digital delivery. Methods/design: This mixed-methods non-randomised feasibility study, with a nested process evaluation, will explore the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the ADVANCE digital intervention to men in substance use treatment who have perpetrated IPA towards a female partner in the past year. Sixty men will be recruited from seven substance use treatment services in Great Britain. The ADVANCE digital intervention comprises a preparatory one-toone session with a facilitator to set goals, develop a personal safety plan, and increase motivation and a preparatory online group to prepare men for taking part in the intervention. The core intervention comprises six fortnightly online group sessions and 12 weekly self-directed website sessions to recap and practise skills learned in the online group sessions. Each website session is followed by a one-to-one video/phone coaching session with a facilitator. Men will also receive their usual substance use treatment. Men's female (ex) partners will be invited to provide outcome data and offered support from integrated safety services (ISS). Outcome measures for men and women will be sought post intervention (approximately 4 months post male baseline interview). Feasibility parameters to be estimated include eligibility, suitability, consent, recruitment, attendance, retention and follow-up rates. In-depth interviews or focus groups will explore the intervention's acceptability to participants, facilitators and ISS workers.

From the perspective of a practitioner psychologist, this paper first considers the utility of virtual reality assessment of emerging behavioural health concerns for remote monitoring purposes. Key opportunities include using virtual reality for functional cognitive testing and leveraging the predictive abilities of multimodal data for personalised insights into symptomology. Suggestions are given as to how astronauts can self-monitor usage of virtual leisure activities that facilitate positive emotional experiences. Secondly, the potential to develop virtual reality countermeasures to deliver semi-structured therapeutic interventions such as collaborative cognitive-behavioural formulation in the absence of real-time communication is discussed.

Potential covariates of breastfeeding (sociodemographic, perinatal, physi-cal/mental health, professional perinatal care, changes in healthcare due to the pandemic, COVID-19 re-lated, breastfeeding support, governmental containment measures and countries' inequality levels) were studied by Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models.Results: A model encompassing all covariates of interest explained 24% of the variance of breastfeed-ing rates across countries (first six months postpartum). Overall, first child (fi =-0.27), age of the child (fi =-0.29), preterm birth (fi =-0.52), admission to the neonatal/pediatric care (fi =-0.4 4), lack of breastfeeding support (fi =-0.18), current psychiatric treatment (fi =-0.69) and inequality (fi =-0.71) were negatively associated with breastfeeding ( p < .001). Access to postnatal support groups was posi-tively associated with breastfeeding (fi = 0.59; p < .001). In countries with low-inequality, governmental measures to contain virus transmission had a deleterious effect on breastfeeding (fi =-0.16; p < .05) while access to maternity leave protected breastfeeding (fi = 0.50; p < .001). Discussion: This study shows that mother's COVID-19 diagnosis and changes in healthcare and birth/postnatal plans did not influence breastfeeding rates. Virtual support groups help women manage breastfeeding, particularly when their experiencing a first child and for those under psychiatric treat-ment. The complex associations between covariates and breastfeeding vary across countries, suggesting the need to define context-specific measures to support breastfeeding.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of a 360° virtual tour of the college environment on the anxiety of newly arrived students during the COVID-19 pandemic,Not Multi User,"Hayrabedian, A; Ghadami, A; Rarani, SA",NURSING AND MIDWIFERY STUDIES,2023,"Background: University education has been held virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, students were confused and anxious while attending college, both because they were exposed to a new environment and fearful of coronavirus infection. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a 360 degrees virtual tour of the college physical environment on the anxiety of newly arrived students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This single-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted between January and February 2021, with 80 nursing, midwifery, and surgical technology students from the Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. Students were randomly allocated into an intervention group and a control group, each with 40 students. Students in the intervention group received a 360 degrees virtual tour of the college physical environment to be familiarized with the college environment. Students in the control group, on the other hand, were personally familiarized with the physical environment of the college. Students' anxiety levels were measured before and after the intervention using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Independent samples t-test, paired t-test, and chi-square test were used to analyze the data. Results: The mean anxiety score in the intervention group decreased from 48.2 +/- 2.66 to 37.7 +/- 3.03 after the intervention (P<0.001). However, the mean anxiety score did not change significantly in the control group (P=0.59).

This is a secondary analysis of the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for NF (3RP-NF), an 8-week virtual group intervention that teaches mind-body skills (e.g., relaxation, mindfulness) to improve quality of life. Participants were randomized to 3RP-NF or the Health Enhancement Program for NF (HEP-NF) consisting of health informational sessions and discussion. We evaluated depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) at posttreatment, 6 months, and 12 months. Both groups improved in depression and anxiety between baseline and posttest, 6 months, and 12 months. The 3RP-NF group showed greater improvements in depression scores from baseline to 6 months compared with HEP-NF and with lower rates of clinically significant depressive symptoms. There were no between-group differences for anxiety. Both interventions reduced distress and anxiety symptoms for individuals with NF. The 3RP-NF group may be better at sustaining these improvements.

The impact of need-based care on formal caregivers' wellbeing in nursing homes: A cluster randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Gillis, K; van Diermen, L; Lips, D; Lahaye, H; De Witte, M; Van Wiele, L; Roelant, E; Hockley, J; Van Bogaert, P",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES,2024,"Background: Need-based care is a structured and standardized model that supports formal caregivers in nursing homes in delivering person-centered care by responding with tailored non-pharmacological interventions on residents' unmet needs as well as having positive effects on behavioral and psychological symptoms on residents with dementia. However, limited resources as well as the shortage of caregivers in nursing homes make the implementation of need-based care challenging, especially when it comes to finding ways to spend more time with residents. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the implementation of need-based care in nursing homes on formal caregivers' wellbeing. Methods: A three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial was set up in 24 Belgian nursing homes: formal caregivers in the 'need-based care' group (intervention; n = 195) spent time twice a week with residents who had behavioral and psychological symptoms according to the principles of need-based care while formal caregivers in the 'time' group (n = 257) filled in the way they spent time twice a week; a third group delivered standard care (n = 299). An implementation strategy was built upon the Implementation Quality Framework and used in the 'need-based care group'. A total of 741 formal caregivers completed the digital questionnaire at one or more of the five time points (every nine weeks) between November 2021 and July 2022; they rated their sense of competence in dementia care, level of burnout, and, level of engagement. Moments of time were registered in a printed registration book. Results: Only formal caregivers from the 'need-based care' group experienced a higher sense of competence in dementia care at time points three (p = 0.010) and four (p = 0.001) compared with baseline with an increase of respectively 1.5 (95 % confidence interval [0.25, 2.841) and 2.4 (95 % confidence interval [0.77, 4.041) points. No differences in scores on burnout and engagement were found. Conclusion: Despite challenging workforce circumstances in nursing homes, caregivers in the need-based care group as well as in the time group were able to spend time twice a week with residents with behavioral and psychological symptoms. No negative effects were found on formal caregivers' wellbeing after the implementation of need-based care in nursing homes. However, it requires strong leadership and the use of well-considered implementation strategies including reflective practice. Trial registry: Trial registration number ISRCTN56768265 (10/08/2023).

The impact of technology on promoting physical activities and mental health: a gender-based study,Other,"Liu, YY; Zhang, HX; Xu, RL",BMC PSYCHOLOGY,2023,"BackgroundPhysical inactivity is a significant public health concern globally, associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases and detrimental effects on both physical and mental health. Technologically based interventions have emerged as a potential solution to promote physical activity engagement and improve mental health outcomes. However, understanding the effectiveness of these interventions and the role of gender in their outcomes is essential for developing tailored strategies.ObjectiveThis study aims to examine the effectiveness of technologically based interventions in promoting physical activity and improving mental health outcomes, with a specific focus on gender differences.MethodologyThis study employed a three-phase mixed methods research design. Phase one was an experimental phase where 300 participants were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The intervention group received a technologically based physical activity intervention, while the control group did not. Physical activity levels and mental health outcomes were assessed before and after the intervention. Phase two involved qualitative interviews with a subset of participants (n = 20) from the intervention group. These interviews explored motivations and barriers to physical activity, aiming to uncover personal factors influencing engagement. Thematic analysis was used to identify recurring themes. Phase three utilized a quantitative survey to compare motivations and barriers between males and females. The survey, administered to a larger sample, included participants from both intervention and control groups. It assessed various factors and allowed for a quantitative comparison of gender differences.Findingsfindings indicated that the intervention improved the mental health and physical activities level of the intervention groups.

Methods: A systematic search was performed in September 2021 through PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and ISI web of science. We selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared virtual reality in the intervention group versus placebo or no intervention in the control group among laboring women during their normal delivery. Revman software was used for performing our meta-analysis. Our primary outcome was the pain score evaluated during the labor process by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Our secondary outcomes were anxiety and satisfaction scores during childbirth in addition to the duration of the first and second stages of labor. Results: Eight RCTs met our inclusion criteria with a total number of 466 patients. We found virtual reality was linked to a significant reduction in the VAS pain score during labor compared to the control group (MD =-1.40, 95% CI [-1.83,-0.96], p < 0.001).

The mechanism and effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention for reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder: A protocol of randomized control trial of ecological momentary intervention and assessment,Other,"Wang, Q; Ng, SM; Zhou, XC",PLOS ONE,2023,"BackgroundExisting studies have unequivocally demonstrated that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience various stressful daily life events and suffer from psychological distress. Mindfulness level is found to be an effective buffer between parents' appraisal of stress life events and psychological distress. However, the mechanism behind the function of mindfulness is unclear, and traditional mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in experimental settings is not tailored to personal real-life needs. This study proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of MBI delivered by ecological momentary intervention (EMI) and assessed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in changing participants' cognitive appraisal of stressful life events and thus reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with ASD.MethodThe proposed study will recruit 670 parents of children with ASD and randomly assign them to the intervention and control groups (335 in each group). Participants in the intervention group will install the EMI/A app on their smartphones. In the app, participants can receive practice prompts daily, browse and practice different mindfulness exercises in the intervention library at any time, talk to a virtual counselor (chatbot) when feeling stressed, complete EMA on the cognitive appraisal of life events, and receive the log of change of psychological status daily. Participants in the control group will only receive audio-based standardized mindfulness practice instructions three times per week. The effects of MBI will be assessed based on the EMA data, right after the intervention and at the 2-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be participants' psychological distress measured by the depression anxiety stress scale. The secondary outcomes will include participants' subjective well-being, measured by the satisfaction with life scale, and level of resilience, measured by the psychological empowerment scale. Multilevel structural equational modelling will be applied to examine the pathways of the relationship between daily life events, cognitive appraisal, and psychological distress.DiscussionThe potential benefit of the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants suffering from other psychological issues in the future.Trial registration: This trial has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov with the ID of NCT05746468.DiscussionThe potential benefit of the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants suffering from other psychological issues in the future.Trial registration: This trial has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov with the ID of NCT05746468.",10.1371/journal.pone.0291168,"pubmed, wos",Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0291168)
The natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia: What have we learned in the last decade?,Not mental health,"Kirby, RS",UROLOGY,2000,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) frequently has a significant detrimental impact on a patient's quality of life. If the disease is left untreated, it may progress in severity, leading to recurrent bladder infections, bladder calculi, and acute urinary retention (AUR), necessitating surgical treatment. The Forth Valley, Scotland, study reported that 14% of men aged 40 to 50 years have BPH. This increases to 45% of men >60 years old. BPH has been shown to be nearly as prevalent as hypertension and diabetes among patients seeking treatment for erectile dysfunction. The effects of BPH on quality of life include lack of sleep, anxiety, reduced mobility, interference with leisure activities and usual daily activities, and a compromised sense of well-being. Three symptoms are associated with an increased risk of AUR in men with BPH: a reduction in the force of the urinary stream, a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, and an enlarged prostate gland on digital rectal examination. Age is a strong independent risk factor for the development of AUR. transurethral resection of the prostate was more effective than watchful waiting in preventing AUR, as shown in the Veteran's Affairs Cooperative Study. Data from the Olmsted County study revealed that urinary flow decreases and prostate sine increases with advanced age. This study also showed that lower urinary tract symptoms have a negative impact on parameters of physical and mental aspects of health. More recently, studies have shown that medical treatment with 5 alpha -reductase inhibitors and possibly also alpha -blockers may alter the natural history and progression of BPH.

The stay strong app as a self-management tool for first nations people with chronic kidney disease: a qualitative study,Not mental health,"Nagel, T; Dingwall, KM; Sweet, M; Kavanagh, D; Majoni, SW; Sajiv, C; Cass, A",BMC NEPHROLOGY,2022,"Background The high burden of chronic kidney disease in First Nations peoples requires urgent attention. Empowering people to self-manage their own condition is key, along with promotion of traditional knowledge and empowerment of First Nations communities. This study explores the potential of a culturally responsive tool, already found to have high acceptability and feasibility among First Nations people, to support self-management for First Nations people with kidney failure. The Stay Strong app is a holistic wellbeing intervention. This study explores the suitability of the Stay Strong app to support self-management as shown by the readiness of participants to engage in goal setting. Data were collected during a clinical trial which followed adaption of research tools and procedures through collaboration between content and language experts, and community members with lived experience of kidney failure. Methods First Nations (i.e., Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) participants receiving haemodialysis in the Northern Territory (n = 156) entered a three-arm, waitlist, single-blind randomised controlled trial which provided collaborative goal setting using the Stay Strong app at baseline or at 3 months. Qualitative data gathered during delivery of the intervention were examined using both content and thematic analysis. Results Almost all participants (147, 94%) received a Stay Strong session: of these, 135 (92%) attended at least two sessions, and 83 (56%) set more than one wellbeing goal. Using a deductive approach to manifest content, 13 categories of goals were identified. The three most common were to: 'connect with family or other people', 'go bush/be outdoors' and 'go home/be on country'. Analysis of latent content identified three themes throughout the goals: 'social and emotional wellbeing', 'physical health' and 'cultural connection'. Conclusion This study provides evidence of the suitability of the Stay Strong app for use as a chronic condition self-management tool. Participants set goals that addressed physical as well as social and emotional wellbeing needs, prioritising family, country, and cultural identity. The intervention aligns directly with self-management approaches that are holistic and prioritise individual empowerment.

Secondary outcomes included physical and mental functioning, stroke self-management, patient experience, and health and social service use costs. The intention-to-treat principle was used to conduct the primary and secondary analyses.ResultsNinety participants were enrolled (44 intervention, 46 control); 11 (12%) participants were lost to follow-up, leaving 79 (39 intervention, 40 control). No significant between-group differences were seen for baseline to six-month risk of hospital readmission. Differences favouring the intervention group were seen in the following secondary outcomes: physical functioning (SF-12 PCS mean difference: 5.10; 95% CI: 1.58-8.62, p = 0.005), stroke self-management (Southampton Stroke Self-Management Questionnaire mean difference: 6.00; 95% CI: 0.51-11.50, p = 0.03), and patient experience (Person-Centred Coordinated Care Experiences Questionnaire mean difference: 2.64, 95% CI: 0.81, 4.47, p = 0.005). No between-group differences were found in total healthcare costs or other secondary outcomes.ConclusionsAlthough participation in the TCSI did not impact hospital readmissions, there were improvements in physical functioning, stroke self-management and patient experience in older adults with stroke and multimorbidity without increasing total healthcare costs. Challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including the shift from in-person to virtual delivery, and re-deployment of interventionists could have influenced the results. A larger pragmatic RCT is needed to determine intervention effectiveness in diverse geographic settings and ethno-cultural populations and examine intervention scalability.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04278794.

The synergetic effect of learning styles on the interaction between virtual environments and the enhancement of spatial thinking,Not mental health,"Hauptman, H; Cohen, A",COMPUTERS & EDUCATION,2011,"Students have difficulty learning 3D geometry: spatial thinking is an important aspect of the learning processes in this academic area. In light of the unique features of virtual environments and the influence of metacognitive processes (e.g., self-regulating questions) on the teaching of mathematics, we assumed that a combination of self-regulating questions and virtual environments would enhance spatial thinking through the exercise of certain spatial abilities with the VR Spaces 1.0 software. These two methods primarily focus on the cognitive domain. In terms of learning styles, we define different cognitive characteristics. The main objective of the present study was to examine whether students with a certain learning style would benefit more from this exercise than other students. To assess the effect of these methods, a sample of 192 10th graders were randomly assigned to four groups, two of which used Virtual Spaces 1.0 (Group 1 with virtual reality and self-regulating questions, N = 52; Group 2 with virtual reality only, N = 52) while the other two used non-Virtual Spaces 1.0 (Group 3 with self-regulating questions only, N = 45; Group 4 was the non-treatment group; N = 45). The findings indicate a differential impact of virtual environments on students with different modal and personal learning styles. The post-test scores for all students (except audio students on the Aptitude Profile Test Series - Educational) were significantly higher than the pre-test scores. The unique nature of this study's findings expresses itself in the fact that the sensing students (S type) scored higher than the intuitive students (N type) on the Mental Rotation Test group 2 alone. Additionally, the scores of the visual students were higher then those of the kinesthetic style but not significantly. These findings suggest that virtual environment decreases the gap in performance results between the visual and kinesthetic students and highlight the importance of virtual environments to the sensing and kinesthetic styles.

MethodsThis pilot study used a quasi-experimental design to assess change in symptoms of distress, anxiety, depression and burn-out before and after participating in a virtual, group-based peer support intervention for a duration of 8 weeks. Pre-post change analyses were performed using two-sided, paired t tests. Feasibility was measured by attendance data to demonstrate the use of the intervention. Receptivity was measured using a global change rating and net promoter score at the end of each session and 8-week period, respectively. During the final session, qualitative data on physician experience was collected and then analyzed using conventional content analysis. ResultsTwenty-four emergency medicine physicians participated in the pilot study. The attendance goal was met by 20 (24, 83%) physicians and 19 (22, 86%) physicians reported they would recommend peer support groups to a friend of colleague. Positive standardized response mean effect sizes indicated modest improvement in nine of 12 symptom measurements with marginal significance (p < 0.10) for improvement in guilt [20, Effect Size (ES) = 0.45] and depression (21, ES = 0.39). Qualitative findings revealed high overall benefit with few adverse impacts of participation.

The use of virtual reality to reduce stress among night-shift anesthesiologists: study protocol for a crossover trial,Other,"Chen, CJ; Chen, LB; Shen, N; Luo, CF; Wang, R; Fang, HY; Zhang, Q; Hei, ZQ",TRIALS,2021,"BackgroundBecause of the lack of anesthesia workforce, anesthesiologists are forced to work overtime and more night shifts, which can disturb their biological rhythm and cause severe stress and depression, potentially leading to negative and even devastating outcomes for both themselves and patients. Virtual reality (VR), a new method to reduce stress and pain for patients, has been widely used in biomedical fields. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effectiveness of VR technology in reducing stress among night-shift anesthesiologists.MethodsIn this randomized controlled, crossover, single-center clinical trial, a total of 30 anesthesiologists will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either the VR immersion group (intervention group) or the routine night-shift group (control group) with a washout of 1week. Anesthesiologists in the intervention group will undergo VR immersion twice, while anesthesiologists in the control group will not watch VR videos during the night shift. The primary outcome will be the difference in the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) score between the two groups. Secondary outcomes will include the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), perceived stress scores (visual analogue scale (VAS)), and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) scores; levels of satisfaction among the participants; incidence of arrhythmia; and incidence of chest tightness, headache, and palpitations.DiscussionIt is unknown whether the use of VR technology during the night shift can reduce stress among anesthesiologists. With the widespread use of VR technology, a positive result in this trial could spur hospitals to apply VR technology to reduce stress among night-shift doctors in every department and provide a relatively relaxed working environment.Trial registrationChinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2000031025.

The wellbeing neuro course: a randomised controlled trial of an internet-delivered transdiagnostic psychological intervention for adults with neurological disorders,Not Multi User,"Gandy, M; Heriseanu, AI; Balakumar, T; Karin, E; Walker, J; Hathway, T; Bisby, MA; Scott, AJ; Dudeney, J; Fisher, A; Titov, N; Dear, BF",PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,2023,"Background. Mental health and functional difficulties are highly comorbid across neurological disorders, but supportive care options are limited. This randomised controlled trial assessed the efficacy of a novel transdiagnostic internet-delivered psychological intervention for adults with neurological disorders. Methods. 221 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or an acquired brain injury were allocated to either an immediate treatment group (n = 115) or treatment-as-usual waitlist control (n = 106). The intervention, the Wellbeing Neuro Course, was delivered online via the eCentreClinic website. The Course includes six lessons, based on cognitive behavioural therapy, delivered over 10 weeks with support from a psychologist via email and telephone. Primary outcomes were symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and disability (WHODAS 2.0). Results. 215 participants commenced the trial (treatment n = 111; control n = 104) and were included in intention-to-treat analysis. At post-treatment, we observed significant between-group differences in depression (PHQ-9; difference = 3.07 [95% CI 2.04-4.11], g = 0.62), anxiety (GAD-7; difference = 1.87 [0.92-2.81], g = 0.41) and disability (WHODAS 2.0 difference = 3.08 [1.09-5.06], g = 0.31), that favoured treatment (all ps < 0.001). Treatment-related effects were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Findings were achieved with minimal clinician time (average of 95.7 min [S.D. = 59.3] per participant), highlighting the public health potential of this approach to care.

The widening of the gaze cone in patients with social anxiety disorder and its normalization after CBT,Not Digital,"Harbort, J; Witthöft, M; Spiegel, J; Nick, K; Hecht, H",BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY,2013,"Gaze plays a crucial role in social interactions. Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), which is associated with severe impairment of social interactions, is thus likely to exhibit disturbances of gaze perception. We conducted two experiments with SAD-patients and healthy control participants using a virtual head whose gaze could be interactively manipulated. We determined the subjective area of mutual gaze, the so-called gaze cone, and measured it prior to and after a psychotherapeutic intervention (Exp. 1). Patients exhibited larger gaze cones than control subjects. Exp. 2 varied the emotional expression of the virtual head. These data were validated using a real person (professional actor) as stimulus. Excellent reliability indices were found for our gaze cone measure. After Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, group differences in gaze cone width had disappeared. Emotional expressions were observed to modulate the gaze cone's width. Especially an angry expression caused the gaze cone to widen, possibly mediated by increased arousal. Finally, wider gaze cones in SAD-patients could be demonstrated for virtual and for real human heads confirming the ecological validity of virtual heads. The findings are of relevance for a more fine-grained understanding of perceptual processes in patients with SAD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Theories of change for e-health interventions targeting HIV/STIs and sexual risk, substance use and mental ill health amongst men who have sex with men: systematic review and synthesis",Other,"Meiksin, R; Melendez-Torres, GJ; Falconer, J; Witzel, TC; Weatherburn, P; Bonell, C",SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,2021,"Background: Sexual risk, substance use, and mental ill health constitute a syndemic of co-occurring, mutually reinforcing epidemics amongst men who have sex with men (MSM). Developed since 1995, e-health interventions offer accessible, anonymous support and can be effective in addressing these outcomes, suggesting the potential value of developing e-health interventions that address these simultaneously amongst MSM. We conducted a systematic review of e-health interventions addressing one or more of these outcomes amongst MSM and in this paper describe the theories of change underpinning relevant interventions, what these offer and how they might complement each other. Methods: We identified eligible reports via expert requests, reference-checking and database and Google searches. Results were screened for reports published in 1995 or later; focused on MSM; reporting on e-health interventions providing ongoing support to prevent HIV/STIs, sexual risk behaviour, substance use, anxiety or depression; and describing intervention theories of change. Reviewers assessed report quality, extracted intervention and theory of change data, and developed a novel method of synthesis using diagrammatic representations of theories of change. Results: Thirty-three reports on 22 intervention theories of change were included, largely of low/medium-quality. Inductively grouping these theories according to their core constructs, we identified three distinct groupings of theorised pathways. In the largest, the 'cognitive/skills' grouping, interventions provide information and activities which are theorised to influence behaviour via motivation/intention and self-efficacy/perceived control. In the 'self-monitoring' grouping, interventions are theorised to trigger reflection, self-reward/critique and self-regulation. In the 'cognitive therapy' grouping, the theory of change is rooted in cognitive therapy techniques, aiming to reframe negative emotions to improve mental health. Conclusions: The synthesised theories of change provide a framework for developing e-health interventions that might holistically address syndemic health problems amongst MSM. Improving reporting on theories of change in primary studies of e-health interventions would enable a better understanding of how they are intended to work and the evidence supporting this. The novel diagrammatic method of theory of change synthesis used here could be used for future reviews where interventions are driven by existing well-defined behaviour and behaviour change theories.",10.1186/s13643-020-01523-2,"pubmed, wos",General & Internal Medicine,e-Health; Digital health; Men who have sex with men; Sexual health; HIV; STI; Substance use; Mental health; Systematic review; Theory of change,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13643-020-01523-2)

Therapeutically applied Minecraft groups with neurodivergent youth,Good,"Kilmer E, Spangler J, Kilmer J.",F1000Res,2023,"ackground: Therapeutically applied Minecraft groups are an intervention designed to support social engagement, confidence, and competence in youth. The flexible interaction format and use of a popular digital game support the fit of this intervention for use with neurodivergent youth. Minecraft is leveraged to support opportunities to build authentic relationships and social confidence in an engaging, low-stakes environment with peers. The group format allows for real-world social practice with peers, while the game environment can support motivation to interact with others, and provides multiple modes for such interaction (i.e., chat, building/movement with the avatar).

Methods: This article outlines the theoretical foundations of therapeutically applied Minecraft groups as well as practical considerations for implementation. The method outlined includes the justification for this method, process of creating support groups, check-in and check-out processes, and in-game activity examples for different situations.

Use cases: Use cases are included to illustrate how the methods have been used in the past to support social growth with neurodivergent youth. Use cases include examples of different Minecraft servers, such as the habitat, and identifying stresses of social growth such as school anxiety and how the use of therapeutically applied Minecraft helped.

Conclusions: Therapeutically applied Minecraft groups can provide opportunities for peer connection and social practice in a facilitated environment. Though the use of Minecraft and other games to support learning and social connection is prevalent in the media, the academic research in this area is sparse. This article provides an example of Minecraft in use in a therapeutic context and calls for more formal research in this area of therapeutically applied games.",10.12688/f1000research.129090.2,pubmed,NA,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.129090.2)
Therapist Feedback and Implications on Adoption of an Artificial Intelligence-Based Co-Facilitator for Online Cancer Support Groups: Mixed Methods Single-Arm Usability Study,Good,"Leung, YW; Ng, S; Duan, LR; Lam, C; Chan, KN; Gancarz, M; Rennie, H; Trachtenberg, L; Chan, KP; Adikari, A; Fang, L; Gratzer, D; Hirst, G; Wong, JH; Esplen, MJ",JMIR CANCER,2023,"Background: The recent onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing requirement have created an increased demand for virtual support programs. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may offer novel solutions to management challenges such as the lack of emotional connections within virtual group interventions. Using typed text from online support groups, AI can help identify the potential risk of mental health concerns, alert group facilitator(s), and automatically recommend tailored resources while monitoring patient outcomes.Objective: The aim of this mixed methods, single-arm study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, validity, and reliability of an AI-based co-facilitator (AICF) among CancerChatCanada therapists and participants to monitor online support group participants' distress through a real-time analysis of texts posted during the support group sessions. Specifically, AICF (1) generated participant profiles with discussion topic summaries and emotion trajectories for each session, (2) identified participant(s) at risk for increased emotional distress and alerted the therapist for follow-up, and (3) automatically suggested tailored recommendations based on participant needs. Online support group participants consisted of patients with various types of cancer, and the therapists were clinically trained social workers.Methods: Our study reports on the mixed methods evaluation of AICF, including therapists' opinions as well as quantitative measures. AICF's ability to detect distress was evaluated by the patient's real-time emoji check-in, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised.Results: Although quantitative results showed only some validity of AICF's ability in detecting distress, the qualitative results showed that AICF was able to detect real-time issues that are amenable to treatment, thus allowing therapists to be more proactive in supporting every group member on an individual basis. However, therapists are concerned about the ethical liability of AICF's distress detection function.Conclusions: Future works will look into wearable sensors and facial cues by using videoconferencing to overcome the barriers associated with text-based online support groups.International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): RR2-10.2196/21453(JMIR Cancer 2023;9:e40113) doi: 10.2196/40113",10.2196/40113,"pubmed, wos",Oncology,cancer; recommender system; natural language processing; LIWC; emotion analysis; therapist adoption; therapist attitudes; legal implications of AI; therapist liability,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/40113)

Therapist-Assisted Web-Based Intervention for Prolonged Grief Disorder After Cancer Bereavement: Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Kaiser, J; Nagl, M; Hoffmann, R; Linde, K; Kersting, A",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,2022,"Background: Bereavement due to cancer increases the risk of prolonged grief disorder. However, specialized treatment options for prolonged grief after a loss due to illness are still scarce. Objective: The aim of this study is to extend previous findings by evaluating a web-based cognitive behavioral intervention with asynchronous therapist support, consisting of structured writing tasks adapted specifically for prolonged grief after cancer bereavement. Methods: The intervention was evaluated in a purely web-based randomized waitlist-controlled trial. Open-access recruitment of participants was conducted on the web. Prolonged grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief), depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, somatization, sleep quality, and mental and physical health were assessed on the web via validated self-report measures. Results: A total of 87 participants were randomized into the intervention group (IG; 44/87, 51%) or the waitlist control group (43/87, 49%). Of the participants, 7% (6/87) dropped out of the study (5/44, 11%, in the IG). Of the 39 completers in the IG, 37 (95%) completed all intervention tasks.

Third-wave cognitive behavioral therapies for caregivers of cancer patients: a scoping review,Population,"Hong, BM; Yang, SR; Hyeon, S; Kim, S; Lee, JY",BMC COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE AND THERAPIES,2023,"BackgroundCancer caregivers extend comprehensive support covering all aspects of patients' daily lives. It has been reported that a significant proportion of cancer caregivers experience emotional distress. As one way to solve this problem, third-wave cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), which involves integrating acceptance and mindfulness into cognitive-behavioral therapy, has been applied to improve caregiver outcomes.MethodsA scoping review was conducted based on the scoping review guidelines proposed by the Jonna Briggs Institute (JBI). The population was caregivers of cancer patients, the concept was third-wave CBT, and the context remained open. English and Korean publications published from 2001 to June 2022 were identified from PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Korea Med, and RISS.ResultsA total of 12 studies were included in this scoping review. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) was the most frequently applied intervention (n = 3, each). Among the components of third-wave CBT, 'mindfulness' was identified in all the studies reviewed (n = 12). Dyadic interventions comprised the majority (n = 9). Interventions using digital technologies such as mobile application/web page (n = 3), telephone (n = 3), and FaceTime (n = 2) have increased since 2017. Depression was the most frequently evaluated outcome (n = 8), followed by anxiety and mindfulness (n = 6, each).ConclusionsThe current review explored available third-wave CBT intervention studies for cancer caregivers and targeted outcomes. Most of the interventions were dyadic interventions and utilized mindfulness. Delivery methods were continuously updated with digital technologies.

Three Good Things Digital Intervention Among Health Care Workers: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Gold, KJ; Dobson, ML; Sen, A",ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE,2023,"PURPOSE Positive psychology shows promise in improving positive affect and happiness. We tested a digital version of a positive psychology intervention called Three Good Things (3GT) among health care workers to assess whether gratitude practice improved well-being. METHODS All members of a large academic medicine department were invited. Partici-pants were randomized to an immediate intervention group or control group (delayed intervention). Participants completed outcome measures surveys (demographics, depres-sion, positive affect, gratitude, and life satisfaction) at baseline, and at 1 month and 3 months post-intervention. Controls completed additional surveys at 4 and 6 months (com-pletion of the delayed intervention). During the intervention, we sent 3 text messages per week asking for 3GT that occurred that day. We used linear mixed models to compare the groups and to look at the effects of department role, sex, age, and time on outcomes.

In addition, no studies have examined how digital engagement strategies may impact the engagement and efficacy of digital interventions in suicide prevention. The current protocol describes a three-arm parallel randomised controlled trial. A therapeutic smartphone application ('LifeBuoy'; intervention condition) will be tested against a condition that consists of the LifeBuoy application plus access to a digital engagement strategy ('LifeBuoy+engagement'; intervention condition) to determine whether the addition of the digital strategy improves app engagement metrics. To establish the efficacy of the LifeBuoy application, both of these intervention conditions will be tested against an attention-matched control condition (a placebo app). Methods and analysis 669 young Australians aged 17-24 years who have experienced suicidal ideation in the past 30 days will be recruited by Facebook advertisement. The primary outcomes will be suicidal ideation severity and level of app engagement. Primary analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach and compare changes from baseline to 30-day, 60-day and 120-day follow-up time points relative to the control group using mixed-effect modelling. A subset of participants in the intervention groups will be interviewed on their experience with the app and engagement strategy. Qualitative data will be analysed using an inductive approach, independent of a theoretical confirmative method to identify the group themes. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee (HC210400).

Towards a conceptual framework of the working alliance in a blended low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for depression in primary mental health care: a qualitative study,Other,"Doukani, A; Free, C; Michelson, D; Araya, R; Montero-Marin, J; Smith, S; Cerga-Pashoja, A; Kakuma, R",BMJ OPEN,2020,"Objectives To examine and adapt a conceptual framework of the working alliance (WA) in the context of a low-intensity blended (psychological well-being practitioner (PWP) plus computerised program) cognitive behavioural therapy intervention (b-CBT) for depression. Design Patient involvement was enlisted to collaboratively shape the design of the project from the onset, before data collection. In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with participants who experienced b-CBT as part of the E-compared trial. A thematic analysis was conducted using a constant comparative method informed by grounded theory. Setting Recruitment was carried out in four psychological primary care services across the UK. Participants Nineteen trial participants with major depressive disorder who completed at least one computerised program and face-to-face session with a PWP in the b-CBT arm were recruited to the study. Results Qualitative interviews that were guided by WA theory and patient involvement, revealed four themes: (1) a healthcare provider (PWP and computerised program) with good interpersonal competencies for building a working relationship with the client ('bond'); (2) collaborative efforts between the client and the provider to appropriately identify what the client hopes to achieve through therapy ('goals'); (3) the selection of acceptable therapeutic activities that address client goals and the availability of responsive support ('task') and (4) the promotion of active engagement and autonomous problem solving ('usability heuristics'). Participants described how the PWP and computerised program uniquely and collectively contributed to different WA needs. Conclusions This study is the first to offer a preliminary conceptual framework of WA in b-CBT for depression, and how such demands can be addressed through blended PWP-computerised program delivery. These findings can be used to promote WA in technological design and clinical practice, thereby promoting engagement to b-CBT interventions and effective deployment of practitioner and program resources.",10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036299,wos,General & Internal Medicine,telemedicine; mental health; depression & mood disorders,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036299)

This study compared treatment outcomes for individuals treated before and after a pandemic-driven implementation of virtual PHP.Method: Patients received care at ED treatment centres using the Renfrew Unified Treatment for Eating Disorders and Comorbidity. Patients treated with virtual PHP were compared to patients treated with traditional PHP. Measures of ED symptomology and behaviours, depressive symptoms, anxiety severity, anxiety sensitivity, experiential avoidance, mindfulness, and body mass index (BMI; reported for anorexia nervosa [AN] patients only) were collected at intake and discharge. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of treatment group on outcomes, controlling for intake score, comorbidity, discharge status, AN diagnosis, and step-down status.Results: Differences in treatment type were only found for binge eating frequency, with those in virtual PHP reporting significantly lower binge eating episodes at discharge than those in traditional PHP. Body mass index showed significantly less improvement in virtual PHP than in traditional PHP.Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest virtual PHP is feasible and effective, potentially increasing access to evidence-based, intensive ED treatment.

Training Providers in Shared Decision Making for Trauma Treatment Planning,Not Digital,"Etingen, B; Hessinger, JD; Hunley, HA",PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES,2022,"The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)/Department of Defense (DoD) Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for the Management of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Acute Stress Disorder strives to advance the VA's practice of recovery-oriented, evidence-based, patient-centered care (PCC) for veterans with PTSD. A core foundation of PCC is that care is individually tailored to meet the needs and preferences of each patient. Accordingly, the 2017 update to the CPG specifically recommends the use of shared decision making (SDM), an individualized collaborative approach to treatment planning, in the PTSD treatment planning process. Although SDM has been promoted by the CPG throughout the VA and SDM training is being developed, no systemic training was available at the time the guidelines were updated. Additionally, while early research has studied the impact and experience of SDM for the patient, no work has explored provider experiences with SDM for those who work with trauma populations. This project bridges this gap by examining survey data collected 6 months following a formal SDM training to staff and trainees working with veterans who have experienced trauma within a trauma clinic at a large VA hospital. After the training, clinicians understood SDM and were engaging in SDM with their patients. Patients indicated that they were satisfied with and felt like an active participant in the treatment planning process. Clinician assumptions about the SDM process and barriers to SDM shown in previous research were also demonstrated. Implications for future research and practice, such as using decision aids in PTSD treatment planning and targeting clinician beliefs about SDM, are discussed. Impact Statement Recent PTSD clinical practice guidelines recommend engaging patients in SDM, however, research on SDM for PTSD treatment planning is lacking. We found that provider-facing SDM training promotes understanding and use of SDM among PTSD care team members, and patients are satisfied with the incorporation of SDM into PTSD treatment planning. Further development of provider-facing SDM training for PTSD care, such as the virtual training VA recently rolled, is warranted.",10.1037/ser0000511,wos,Psychology,posttraumatic stress disorder; shared decision making; patient preferences; mental health care; veterans,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1037/ser0000511)
Trajectories of Symptoms in Digital Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Using Routine Outcome Monitoring Data: Secondary Analysis Study,Not Multi User,"Cumpanasoiu, DC; Enrique, A; Palacios, JE; Duffy, D; McNamara, S; Richards, D",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2023,"Background: Research suggests there is heterogeneity in treatment response for internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) users, but few studies have investigated the trajectory of individual symptom change across iCBT treatment. Large patient data sets using routine outcome measures allows the investigation of treatment effects over time as well as the relationship between outcomes and platform use. Understanding trajectories of symptom change, as well as associated characteristics, may prove important for tailoring interventions or identifying patients who may not benefit from the intervention.Objective: We aimed to identify latent trajectories of symptom change during the iCBT treatment course for depression and anxiety and to investigate the patients' characteristics and platform use for each of these classes.Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial designed to examine the effectiveness of guided iCBT for anxiety and depression in the UK Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) program. This study included patients from the intervention group (N=256) and followed a longitudinal retrospective design. As part of the IAPT's routine outcome monitoring system, patients were prompted to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) after each supporter review during the treatment period. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify the underlying trajectories of symptom change across the treatment period for both depression and anxiety. Differences in patient characteristics were then evaluated between these trajectory classes, and the presence of a time-varying relationship between platform use and trajectory classes was investigated.Results: Five-class models were identified as optimal for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Around two-thirds (PHQ-9: 155/221, 70.1%; GAD-7: 156/221, 70.6%) of the sample formed various trajectories of improvement classes that differed in baseline score, the pace of symptom change, and final clinical outcome score. The remaining patients were in 2 smaller groups: one that saw minimal to no gains and another with consistently high scores across the treatment journey. Baseline severity, medication status, and program assigned were significantly associated (P<.001) with different trajectories. Although we did not find a time-varying relationship between use and trajectory classes, we found an overall effect of time on platform use, suggesting that all participants used the intervention significantly more in the first 4 weeks (P<.001).Conclusions: Most patients benefit from treatment, and the various patterns of improvement have implications for how the iCBT intervention is delivered. Identifying predictors of nonresponse or early response might inform the level of support and monitoring required for different types of patients. Further work is necessary to explore the differences between these trajectories to understand what works best for whom and to identify early on those patients who are less likely to benefit from treatment.",10.2196/41815,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy; iCBT; depression; anxiety; trajectory of symptom change; routine outcome monitoring data,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/41815)

Efficacy was evaluated at mid- and post-treatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Consistent with our hypothesis, VRET resulted in significant decreases on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale and the PTSD Checklist-Military version for both groups. Also consistent with our hypothesis, significant decreases in social isolation occurred only for those participants who received the TMT group component. There were significant decreases for depression and anger for both groups, although these occurred after VRET and before group treatment. All treatment gains were maintained six-months later. Although not part of the original hypotheses, sleep was not improved by either intervention and remained problematic.

Evidence based treatment options are scarce. Digital health interventions may be promising to deliver psychological treatment to individuals with IUDs directly in their online setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a digital health intervention for IUDs compared to a waitlist control group (WCG). Methods: In a two-armed randomized controlled trial, N = 130 individuals showing IUDs (Internet Addiction Test; IAT >= 49) were randomly allocated to the intervention group (IG; n = 65) or WCG (n = 65). The intervention consisted of 7 sessions based on cognitive behavioral therapy. The primary outcome was IUD symptom severity measured via the IAT at post treatment 7 weeks after randomization. Secondary outcomes included IUD symptoms (Compulsive Internet Use Scale; CIUS), quality of life, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and other psychosocial variables associated with IUDs. Results: Participants were on average 28.45 years old (SD = 10.59) and 50% identified as women, 49% as men, and 1% as non-binary.

Treatment of Storm Fears Using Virtual Reality and Progressive Muscle Relaxation,Not Multi User,"Lima, J; McCabe-Bennett, H; Antony, MM",BEHAVIOURAL AND COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY,2018,"Background: The present study examined the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy for treating individuals with storm fears by comparing a one-session VR exposure treatment with a one-session progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and psychoeducation session. Aims: It was predicted that there would be a reduction in storm-related fear post-treatment for individuals in both conditions, but that this reduction would be greater for those in the VR exposure condition. It was predicted that improvements would be maintained at 30-day follow-up only for those in the VR exposure condition. Method: Thirty-six participants each received one of the two treatment conditions. Those in the PMR treatment group received approximately 30 minutes of PMR and approximately 15 minutes of psychoeducation regarding storms. Those in the VR treatment group received approximately 1 hour of VR exposure. Additionally, participants were asked to complete a pre-treatment and post-treatment 5-minute behavioural approach test to assess changes in storm fears. They were also asked to complete a measure assessing storm phobia. Results: There was a significant interaction between treatment group and self-reported fear at post-treatment, such that fear decreased for both groups, although the reduction was stronger in the VR group. Results also showed that reductions in storm fear were maintained at 30-day follow-up for both groups.

Type D Personality and Global Positioning System Tracked Social Behavior in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease,Not mental health,"Habibovic, M; Gavidia, G; Broers, E; Wetzels, M; Ayoola, I; Ribas, V; Piera-Jimenez, J; Widdershoven, J; Denollet, J",HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY,2020,"Objective: Social behavior (e.g., loneliness, isolation) has been indicated as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recent studies show that Type D personality might be an important predictor of social behavior. Hence, the current exploratory study aims to examine, using ecological assessment, whether Type D personality is associated with a lower likelihood to engage in social encounters in patients with cardiovascular disease. Method: Cardiac patients who participated in the Do CHANGE (Phase 2) trial were included in current analysis. As part of the Do CHANGE intervention, real-life data were collected in the intervention group using the MOVES app, which was installed on patients' mobile phones. For a period of 6 months, Global Positioning System (GPS) data from the participating patients were collected. From the GPS data, 3 target variables were computed: (a) general activity level, (b) social variety, and (c) social opportunity. Results: A total of 70 patients were included in the analysis. Patients with a Type D personality had lower scores on the social opportunity variable compared to non-Type D patients (F = 6.72; p = .01). Type D personality was associated with lower social participation after adjusting for depression and anxiety. No association between Type D personality and general activity or behavioral variety was observed. Conclusions: This is the first study to use an ecological measure to assess social behavior of cardiac patients with a Type D personality.

Understanding the impact of Covid-19 on the delivery and receipt of prison healthcare: an international scoping review,Not mental health,"Hearty, P; Canvin, K; Bellass, S; Hampton, S; Wright, N; Sheard, L",HEALTH & JUSTICE,2023,"BackgroundPeople being held in prison are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 infection, as places of detention are high-risk environments for spread of infection. Due to this risk, many prisons across the globe introduced measures to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission. The pandemic changed almost all aspects of prison life, including prison healthcare provision. We undertook a scoping review to understand what is known about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the receipt and delivery of prison healthcare. This scoping review is part of a wider mixed-methods study focusing more specifically on the impact that Covid-19 had on prison healthcare delivery in England.MethodsWe conducted an international scoping review of peer-reviewed articles published between December 2019 and January 2022, across six electronic databases. We also conducted a hand search of key journals and the reference lists of included articles.ResultsTwelve articles met our inclusion criteria. The articles focused primarily on prisons in high-income countries and mostly explored the impact that the pandemic had on the provision of drug treatment services. Some aspects of drug treatment services were more impacted than others, with those delivered by external providers and preparations for release particularly hindered. Whilst prison mental health services were purportedly available, there were changes regarding how these were delivered, with group therapies suspended and most consultations taking place using telehealth. The articles reported both digital and non-digital adaptations or innovations to prison healthcare services to ensure continued delivery. Collaboration between different agencies, such as the prison itself, healthcare providers, and non-governmental organisations, was key to facilitating ongoing provision of healthcare to people in prison.ConclusionsCovid-19 impacted on prison healthcare internationally, but different treatment services were affected in disparate ways, both within and between countries. The published literature concentrates on the impact on drug treatment services.

Understanding visual snow syndrome: A retrospective study from a tertiary eye care center,Other,"Satgunam, P; Kannan, K; Hathibelagal, AR",INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY,2024,"Purpose: Visual snow syndrome is a debilitating neurological condition. A comprehensive eye examination may not detect any abnormalities in this condition. Presently the condition is recognized only through the history elicited. Hence, it becomes important to understand the presenting complaints and profile of these patients. A retrospective study at a tertiary eye care center was undertaken to achieve this goal.Electronic medical records of patients presenting to a Binocular Vision and Orthoptics clinic were reviewed. Records of the patients containing keywords such as light sensitivity, shadowing, visual snow, multiple images, and night vision were retrieved and inspected. Those matching the diagnostic criteria of visual snow syndrome were included in the study.A total of 33 patients (average age +/- standard deviation: 29.7 +/- 9.8 years) were identified. Majority of the patients were males (69%). All the patients had logMAR visual acuity 0 or better in each eye. The most prominent (84.4%) presenting symptom was palinopsia (or afterimage or trailing). About 34.4% complained of floaters (including snow-like appearance). More than half (54.6%) of the patients also had binocular dysfunction.Visual snow syndrome is a relatively new condition on the rise, with unclear pathology. The symptoms of this condition can easily be confused with regular floaters or black spots seen in vitreous and retinal pathologies. In the absence of such pathology, an elaborate history should be elicited, and the distress of the patient should be acknowledged. The patient should also be reassured that this is not a blinding condition.The Binocular Vision and Orthoptics (BVO) clinic at our tertiary eye care institute is a referral clinic for patients with asthenopic symptoms and binocular vision disorders. This clinic also houses a subclinic called C4U (clinic for unknown), which examines patients with unusual complaints, or those whose symptoms and clinical signs are not in-sync with each other. Majority of the patients recruited in this retrospective study were seen in the C4U or BVO clinic. The electronic medical records in these clinics were reviewed from 2016 to 2022. Keywords such as light sensitivity, shadowing, visual snow, multiple images, and night vision documented in chief complaints or in review notes were used in the search algorithm to retrieve the electronic medical records. The retrieved records were then manually inspected to exclude those with ocular pathology, or with a definitive known ocular diagnosis. Those with unexplained symptoms that matched the existing criteria of visual snow syndrome[1,5,6] were then included, with two exceptions. The exception is that patients were included even if they did not report the symptom of pan field flickering dots, if their other associated symptoms matched the inclusion criteria. Second, a minimum duration of the symptoms should be 3 months to be considered in this syndrome, and this duration was waivered. This was done essentially to characterize the presenting verbal history of these patients.Demographic details of the included patients who had the diagnosis of visual snow syndrome or who were suspected of having visual snow syndrome were extracted, along with their clinical findings. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions. All statistical tests were done using SPSS (IBM, SPSS Statistics, Ver. 21).Database search from the electronic medical records resulted in 231 medical records being retrieved. Applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria by two examiners in a manual review process resulted in including 33 patient records. Majority of the patients were excluded because of ocular pathologies (e.g., strabismus, retinal pathologies). In those patients who were included, the comprehensive eye examination (both anterior and posterior segment findings) was within normal limits. Two patients took teleconsultation for their condition and had taken comprehensive eye examination from elsewhere. At least one additional test that includes visual fields, aberrometry, electrodiagnostic tests such as full-field electroretinogram (ERG), visually evoked potential (VEP), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests were performed on all patients. The most performed test (34%) was the iTrace (Tracey technologies) aberrometry, and the least commonly performed test (3%) was VEP. Abnormal finding was found in MRI of one patient (Tornwaldt's cyst), but it was noted as noncontributory to the symptoms experienced by the patient. In three patients, iTrace showed abnormality due to their native refractive correction. Otherwise, no patients had any significant findings through these additional tests that could contribute to their symptoms.The mean age +/- standard deviation of the patients was 29.7 +/- 9.8 years of age. The ages ranged from 13 to 51 years. There were significantly (chi 2 = 5.12, df = 1, P = 0.024) more males (n = 23, 69%; mean age +/- sd: 30.65 +/- 10.09 years) when compared to females [Fig. 1]. Majority of the patients (50%) had emmetropia (spherical equivalent between -0.5D to +0.5D), followed by myopia (37.5%) and then hyperopia (12.5%). The best-corrected visual acuity of all these patients was logMAR 0 or better in each eye. No color vision deficiency was noted in any of these patients.Frequency distribution of age for females and males in our study cohortThe tabulation for the common symptoms of visual snow syndrome was done for these patients [Table 1] similar to that reported in a recent study.[5] Patients in this cohort presented with symptoms noticed from 20 days to 5 years, with average duration of the symptoms being 1.6 years. Five patients (15.2%) already knew about the visual snow syndrome through online search. About 54.6% of patients had binocular vision dysfunction, mostly due to accommodative dysfunction (61%). The most prominently reported symptom was seeing palinopsia (or afterimage or trailing) (84.4%). One of the patients drew the image they saw [Fig. 2] and clearly described that the shadow images were also clear to discern. This patient indicated that the iTrace output [Fig. 2a] was incorrect in capturing what they perceived and later drew the image to explain what they were actually seeing. Only 34.4% of patients had floaters like complaints. One patient described the floaters as appearance of salt and pepper in front of the object that I am seeing and another patient reported there is some shimmering which is more prominent when looking at a white wall. One patient reported I see like snow fall. Only these three patients were able to describe what appears closer to the static noise as described in the literature. One patient knew about visual snow syndrome through Google search and reported seeing TV static noise. It is unclear how this patient would have explained his symptoms if he was not aware of this condition. Almost half of the patients (48.5%) had headache, and within that only 15.1% were diagnosed with migraine headaches. For those patients with photophobia or light sensitivity (36.4%), filter and/or tinted lens trial was given in our low-vision clinic; only few found it to reduce their symptoms minimally and none reported a complete alleviation of their symptoms. For those with binocular vision disorders (n = 19), appropriate vision therapy was recommended, indicating that the therapy may or may not help with the symptoms the patient is experiencing.(a) iTrace image of a patient, showing no aberrations. (b and c) Figures drawn by the same patient to illustrate the double images seen by them. This clearly demonstrates the nonoptical nature of the problem. Images reproduced with permission from the patientVisual snow syndrome is a relatively new condition that needs to be recognized by all eye care professionals. Toward this effort, this retrospective study was undertaken as a first step to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with this condition in a tertiary eye care center. We observed that the condition appears to be common in young adults, with a mean age of about 30 years. This is in agreement with most of the previous studies[5,6,10-14] [Table 2]. Our study cohort, however, seems to have a higher predisposition for males (69%). This is not in agreement with the earlier studies. Large-scale studies reported in the literature from elsewhere do not show any gender difference.[6,14] Hence, the observation made in our study needs further investigation from a larger population-based study, or from other eye institutes both within and outside India. The refractive error distribution in this cohort seems to be relatively similar to that reported earlier.[6] Essentially, no unusual pattern of refractive error was observed in this condition when compared to the general population as well.Summary of associated symptoms in visual snow syndrome reported in different studiesOne of the striking differences in the presenting history in our cohort when compared to that presented in the Western literature is that only about 34% of patients were able to give a history that resembles the static noise. Given that most of our patients had developed these symptoms suddenly and know how they perceived the world earlier, they should have been able to explain their abnormal perception better. However, that was not the case. It is possible that the majority of the patients in our cohort are not able to articulate their symptoms well and instead are generically stating it as blurred vision or as floaters. Alternatively, the optometrist documenting the history could have also paraphrased it to known terminologies. This emphasizes the need to document the presenting complaints in patient's own words. Documenting the medical history plays an important role in diagnosing this condition; it needs to be carefully elicited and documented verbatim and not rephrased into known medical terminologies. Particularly, complaints of floaters or black spots may require some additional interrogation. A thorough comprehensive eye examination is needed to rule out all other possible pathologies before diagnosing it as visual snow syndrome. Careful dilated retinal examination is necessary to rule out any pathology that may elicit complaints of floaters/black spots. In the absence of such pathologies, the patient should not be dismissed off, especially if the floaters are distressing the patient. It may also help if patients are encouraged to draw what they perceive. Additional symptoms of this condition (e.g. , photophobia, night vision difficulty) should also be interrogated. Tinnitus is another symptom that had a lower prevalence in our cohort, when compared to other studies [Table 2]. This could be again related to not being explicitly asked in the history and, hence, missing it. Additionally, patients may also not report this sign since they may only give history relevant to the eye and its functions. The criteria for diagnosing visual snow syndrome need to be reviewed carefully in an Indian context, given these patients may not be able to articulate their symptoms well. Perhaps a checklist with illustrations can be used when taking history.Typically, light sensitivity is managed by filters or tinted lenses; we found this solution to be not helpful for many of these patients. This is because the source of the perception is not at the end level of the organ or due to optics, but at the cortical level. However, patients having this complaint should be given an opportunity to get a trial to explore if it will help them. Few of those patients with binocular vision disorders can be managed by appropriate vision therapy exercises for the same. However, it must be made very clear to the patient on the scope of improvement after the therapy. The patient should be educated that the visual snow syndrome may not disappear after the therapy, and the therapy can only help in reducing those symptoms that could have resulted from the binocular vision dysfunction. The recent study[9] that showed improvement in quality of life for patients with visual snow syndrome hints that the duration for improvement may take longer (12 weeks of therapy), but shows promise. The measure of binocular vision parameters improvement posttherapy, and its association to symptom reduction was not mentioned in that study. The intriguing nature of association of binocular vision anomalies along with visual snow syndrome is worth probing further in future research studies. The screen time for digital device use was documented in some of the patients in this study [Table 1]. The average screen time was about 8-9 h in this cohort, a duration similar to the general population.[15] This information was not documented in all the patients, and that is a limitation of this retrospective study.Given the visual nature of these complaints, patients may seek assistance from eye care professionals first. A regular comprehensive eye examination may reveal no abnormalities. MRI scans for many of these patients were also within normal limits. A whole cycle of anxiety gets triggered for these patients and some of them get depressed as they repeatedly hear nothing is wrong with your eyes as they seek second, third, or even multiple opinions. A few of these patients are also advised for counseling with a psychiatrist. The first step in managing this condition is to acknowledge the symptoms that the patients have. Reassurance indicating that it is not a blinding condition can reduce the anxiety of the patient to a great extent. The symptoms, however, can be debilitating for the patient, and this needs to be acknowledged, accepted, and not dismissed by the eye care professional. Such a reassurance goes a long way for these patients. The limitation of our understanding and management of visual snow syndrome should also be admitted to the patients in an honest conversation, as nicely explained by Schankin et al.[2] There are online support groups (www.visualsnowinitiative.org, www.eyeonvision.com) formed by patients to help each other, with a list of available resources for this condition. As indicated in an earlier study[2] working with such groups especially to investigate and understand this condition through research can help us in better understanding of this condition. It may be worthwhile to investigate with psychophysical experiments on the sensitivity in visual functions and also design some visual perceptual tests to investigate possible mechanisms through behavioral experiments. A large focus thus far has been on neurological studies with brain imaging. Recent evidence on improvement in symptoms with neuro-optometric rehabilitation[9] also requires further investigation with replication trials. Collectively, across the globe, uniform protocols for diagnosing and managing this condition can help alleviate the symptoms of these patients at a much faster pace.In conclusion, visual snow syndrome is a new condition (at least in India) that is on the rise. Eye care professionals should be aware of this condition and should acknowledge the condition and counsel their patients and reassure them that it will not lead to visual impairment or blindness. This presently remains the primary line of management for this condition. This reassurance by itself relieves a lot of stress and anxiety for these patients. This condition needs a lot more research to fully understand its complexity and to manage it appropriately.Purpose: Visual snow syndrome is a debilitating neurological condition. A comprehensive eye examination may not detect any abnormalities in this condition. Presently the condition is recognized only through the history elicited. Hence, it becomes important to understand the presenting complaints and profile of these patients. A retrospective study at a tertiary eye care center was undertaken to achieve this goal.Electronic medical records of patients presenting to a Binocular Vision and Orthoptics clinic were reviewed. Records of the patients containing keywords such as light sensitivity, shadowing, visual snow, multiple images, and night vision were retrieved and inspected. Those matching the diagnostic criteria of visual snow syndrome were included in the study.A total of 33 patients (average age +/- standard deviation: 29.7 +/- 9.8 years) were identified. Majority of the patients were males (69%). All the patients had logMAR visual acuity 0 or better in each eye. The most prominent (84.4%) presenting symptom was palinopsia (or afterimage or trailing). About 34.4% complained of floaters (including snow-like appearance). More than half (54.6%) of the patients also had binocular dysfunction.Visual snow syndrome is a relatively new condition on the rise, with unclear pathology. The symptoms of this condition can easily be confused with regular floaters or black spots seen in vitreous and retinal pathologies. In the absence of such pathology, an elaborate history should be elicited, and the distress of the patient should be acknowledged. The patient should also be reassured that this is not a blinding condition.The Binocular Vision and Orthoptics (BVO) clinic at our tertiary eye care institute is a referral clinic for patients with asthenopic symptoms and binocular vision disorders. This clinic also houses a subclinic called C4U (clinic for unknown), which examines patients with unusual complaints, or those whose symptoms and clinical signs are not in-sync with each other. Majority of the patients recruited in this retrospective study were seen in the C4U or BVO clinic. The electronic medical records in these clinics were reviewed from 2016 to 2022. Keywords such as light sensitivity, shadowing, visual snow, multiple images, and night vision documented in chief complaints or in review notes were used in the search algorithm to retrieve the electronic medical records. The retrieved records were then manually inspected to exclude those with ocular pathology, or with a definitive known ocular diagnosis. Those with unexplained symptoms that matched the existing criteria of visual snow syndrome[1,5,6] were then included, with two exceptions. The exception is that patients were included even if they did not report the symptom of pan field flickering dots, if their other associated symptoms matched the inclusion criteria. Second, a minimum duration of the symptoms should be 3 months to be considered in this syndrome, and this duration was waivered. This was done essentially to characterize the presenting verbal history of these patients.Demographic details of the included patients who had the diagnosis of visual snow syndrome or who were suspected of having visual snow syndrome were extracted, along with their clinical findings. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions. All statistical tests were done using SPSS (IBM, SPSS Statistics, Ver. 21).Database search from the electronic medical records resulted in 231 medical records being retrieved. Applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria by two examiners in a manual review process resulted in including 33 patient records. Majority of the patients were excluded because of ocular pathologies (e.g., strabismus, retinal pathologies). In those patients who were included, the comprehensive eye examination (both anterior and posterior segment findings) was within normal limits.

Usability and utility of a computerized cognitive-behavioral self-help program for public speaking anxiety,Not Multi User,"Anderson, P; Zimand, E; Schmertz, SK; Ferrer, M",COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL PRACTICE,2007,"This study describes the use of a cognitive-behavioral computer-administered self-help program with minimal therapist contact for public speaking anxiety. Participants (N = 10) with social phobia, as measured by a structured clinical interview, completed the self-help program in an open clinical trial. The program was delivered via a CD-ROM during individual sessions at an outpatient clinic, including 4 sessions of psychoeducation/cognitive therapy and 4 sessions of exposure therapy using a virtual audience presented on a computer screen. A therapist was available in another room to answer questions and to debrief for up to 10 minutes after each session. Participants completed standardized self-report questionnaires assessing social anxiety at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Participants also completed measures of computer usability. Results showed decreases on all self-report measures of social anxiety from Pre- to posttreatment, which were maintained at follow-up (n = 8). Participants also reported that they were satisfied with treatment, that they felt improved after treatment, and that the computer program was user:friendly. This study provides preliminary evidence that a computer-administered cognitive-behavioral-based program that includes minimal therapist contact may reduce public speaking anxiety and suggests that further research with a controlled design is needed.",10.1016/j.cbpra.2006.02.006,wos,Psychology,NA,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2006.02.006)
Usage and Daily Attrition of a Smartphone-Based Health Behavior Intervention: Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Egilsson, E; Bjarnason, R; Njardvik, U",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2023,"Background: Although most adolescents have access to smartphones, few of them use mobile health (mHealth) apps for health improvement, highlighting the apparent lack of interest in mHealth apps among adolescents. Adolescent mHealth interventions have been burdened with high attrition rates. Research on these interventions among adolescents has frequently lacked detailed time-related attrition data alongside analysis of attrition reasons through usage.Objective: The objective was to obtain daily attrition rates among adolescents in an mHealth intervention to gain a deeper understanding of attrition patterns, including the role of motivational support, such as altruistic rewards, through analysis of app usage data.Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 304 adolescent participants (152 boys and 152 girls) aged 13-15 years. Based on 3 participating schools, participants were randomly assigned to control, treatment as usual (TAU), and intervention groups. Measures were obtained at baseline, continuously throughout the 42-day trial period (research groups), and at the trial end. The mHealth app is called SidekickHealth and is a social health game with the following 3 main categories: nutrition, mental health, and physical health. Primary measures were attrition based on time from launch, and the type, frequency, and time of health behavior exercise usage. Outcome differences were obtained through comparison tests, while regression models and survival analyses were used for attrition measures.Results: Attrition differed significantly between the intervention and TAU groups (44.4% vs 94.3%; & chi;21=61.220; P<.001). The mean usage duration was 6.286 days in the TAU group and 24.975 days in the intervention group. In the intervention group, male participants were active significantly longer than female participants (29.155 vs 20.433 days; & chi;21=6.574; P<.001). Participants in the intervention group completed a larger number of health exercises in all trial weeks, and a significant decrease in usage was observed from the first to second week in the TAU group (t105=9.208; P<.001) but not in the intervention group. There was a significant increase in health exercises in the intervention group from the fifth to sixth week (t105=3.446; P<.001). Such a significant increase in usage was not evident in the TAU group. The research group was significantly related to attrition time (hazard ratio 0.308, 95% CI 0.222-0.420), as well as the numbers of mental health exercises (P<.001) and nutrition exercises (P<.001).Conclusions: Differences in attrition rates and usage between groups of adolescents were identified. Motivational support is a significant factor for lowering attrition in adolescent mHealth interventions. The results point to sensitivity periods in the completion of diverse health tasks, and emphasis on time-specific attrition, along with the type, frequency, and time of health behavior exercise usage, is likely a fruitful avenue for further research on mHealth interventions for adolescent populations, in which attrition rates remain excessive.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05912439; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05912439",10.2196/45414,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,mHealth intervention; mobile health; adolescent; attrition; mental health; physical activity,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/45414)
Usage and Weekly Attrition in a Smartphone-Based Health Behavior Intervention for Adolescents: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Egilsson, E; Bjarnason, R; Njardvik, U",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2021,"Background: The majority of adolescents own smartphones, although only 8% of them use health apps. Attrition rates from adolescent mobile health (mHealth) interventions for treating mental health problems such as anxiety and depression are an issue with a high degree of variation. Attrition in mHealth interventions targeting adolescent populations is frequently presented in a two-point fashion, from initiation of the intervention to the end of treatment, lacking more time-specific information on usage and times of attrition. Self-efficacy could provide an avenue to lower attrition rates, although a better understanding of the relationship between mental health factors and time-specific attrition rates is needed. Objective: The aims of this study were to obtain time-specific attrition rates among adolescents in an mHealth intervention, and to describe the intervention's usage and feasibility in relation to adolescent self-efficacy levels, and emotional and physical health. Methods: A single-center randomized controlled public school pilot trial was undertaken with 41 adolescents. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks, while in-app activity and attrition rates were continually assessed throughout the intervention period. The primary outcome was attrition based on time and type of in-app health behavior usage, and feasibility of the mHealth app. Secondary outcome measures were self-efficacy levels, depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as standardized BMI and sleep. Analyses of group mean variances with adjusted a levels through Bonferroni corrections were used to assess main outcome effects. Results: The attrition from initiation of the intervention to 6-week follow up was 35%. Attrition started in the third week of the intervention and was related to daily time of app usage (R-t=0.43, P<.001). The number of average weekly in-app health exercises completed decreased significantly from the first week of the intervention (mean 55.25, SD 10.96) to the next week (mean 13.63, SD 2.94). However, usage increased by 22% between week 2 and the last week of the intervention (mean 16.69, SD 8.37). Usability measures revealed satisfactory scores (mean 78.09, SD 9.82) without gender differences (P=.85). Self-reported daily physical activity increased by 19.61% in the intervention group but dropped by 26.21% among controls. Self-efficacy levels increased by 8.23% in the invention arm compared to a 3.03% decrease in the control group. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and usability of an mHealth intervention among adolescent participants. Indications were toward beneficial effects on physical and mental health that warrant further research. Focus on time-specific attrition measures alongside daily times of usage and ways to increase participants' self-efficacy levels appear to be a promising avenue for research on mHealth interventions for adolescent populations with the aim to ultimately lower attrition rates.",10.2196/21432,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,mHealth; intervention; adolescent; attrition; self-efficacy; mental health; physical activity; young adult; behavior,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/21432)
Use and Engagement With Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques Used Within an App to Support Worry Management: Content Analysis of Log Data,Not Multi User,"Farrand, P; Raue, PJ; Ward, E; Repper, D; Areán, P",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2024,"Background: Low-intensity cognitive behavioral therapy (LICBT) has been implemented by the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services across England to manage excessive worry associated with generalized anxiety disorder and support emotional well-being. However, barriers to access limit scalability. A solution has been to incorporate LICBT techniques derived from an evidence-based protocol within the Iona Mind Well-being app for Worry management (IMWW) with support provided through an algorithmically driven conversational agent.Objective: This study aims to examine engagement with a mobile phone app to support worry management with specific attention directed toward interaction with specific LICBT techniques and examine the potential to reduce symptoms of anxiety.Methods: Log data were examined with respect to a sample of engaged users who had completed at least 1 lesson related to the Worry Time and Problem Solving in-app modules that represented the minimum dose. Paired sample 2-tailed t tests were undertaken to examine the potential for IMWW to reduce worry and anxiety, with multivariate linear regressions examining the extent to which completion of each of the techniques led to reductions in worry and anxiety.Results: There was good engagement with the range of specific LICBT techniques included within IMWW. The vast majority of engaged users were able to interact with the cognitive behavioral therapy model and successfully record types of worry. When working through Problem Solving, the conversational agent was successfully used to support the user with lower levels of engagement. Several users engaged with Worry Time outside of the app. Forgetting to use the app was the most common reason for lack of engagement, with features of the app such as completion of routine outcome measures and weekly reflections having lower levels of engagement. Despite difficulties in the collection of end point data, there was a significant reduction in severity for both anxiety (t(53)=5.5; P<.001; 95% CI 2.4-5.2) and low mood (t(53)=2.3; P=.03; 95% CI 0.2-3.3). A statistically significant linear model was also fitted to the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (F-2,F-51=6.73; P<.001), while the model predicting changes in the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 did not reach significance (F-2,F-51=2.33; P=.11). This indicates that the reduction in these measures was affected by in-app engagement with Worry Time and Problem Solving.Conclusions: Engaged users were able to successfully interact with the LICBT-specific techniques informed by an evidence-based protocol although there were lower completion rates of routine outcome measures and weekly reflections. Successful interaction with the specific techniques potentially contributes to promising data, indicating that IMWW may be effective in the management of excessive worry.

Use of 360° virtual reality video in medical obstetrical education: a quasi-experimental design,Not Multi User,"Arents, V; de Groot, PCM; Struben, VMD; van Stralen, KJ",BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,2021,"Background Video-based teaching has been part of medical education for some time but 360 degrees videos using a virtual reality (VR) device are a new medium that offer extended possibilities. We investigated whether adding a 360 degrees VR video to the internship curriculum leads to an improvement of long-term recall of specific knowledge on a gentle Caesarean Sections (gCS) and on general obstetric knowledge. Methods Two weeks prior to their Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) internship, medical students were divided in teaching groups, that did or did not have access to a VR-video of a gCS. Six weeks after their O&G internship, potentially having observed one or multiple real-life CSs, knowledge on the gCS was assessed with an open questionnaire, and knowledge on general obstetrics with a multiple-choice questionnaire. Furthermore we assessed experienced anxiety during in-person attendance of CSs, and we asked whether the interns would have wanted to attend more CSs in-person. The 360 degrees VR video group was questioned about their experience directly after they watched the video. We used linear regression analyses to determine significant effects on outcomes. Results A total of 89 medical students participated, 41 in the 360 degrees VR video group and 48 in the conventional study group. Watching the 360 degrees VR video did not result in a difference in either specific or general knowledge retention between the intervention group and the conventional study group. This was both true for the grade received for the internship, the open-ended questions as well as the multiple-choice questions and this did not change after adjustment for confounding factors. Still, 83.4% of the 360 degrees VR video-group reported that more videos should be used in training to prepare for surgical procedures. In the 360 degrees VR video-group 56.7% reported side effects like nausea or dizziness. After adjustment for the number of attended CSs during the practical internship, students in the 360 degrees VR video-group stated less often (p = 0.04) that they would have liked to attend more CSs in-person as compared to the conventional study group. Conclusion Even though the use of 360 degrees VR video did not increase knowledge, it did offer a potential alternative for attending a CS in-person and a new way to prepare the students for their first operating room experiences.",10.1186/s12909-021-02628-5,"pubmed, wos",Education & Educational Research,Medical education; Virtual reality; Caesarean section,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02628-5)
Use of Immersive Virtual Reality Spaces to Engage Adolescent and Young Adult Patients With Cancer in Therapist-Guided Support Groups: Protocol for a Pre-Post Study,Other,"Marks, A; Garbatini, A; Hieftje, K; Puthenpura, V; Weser, V; Fernandes, CSF",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2023,"Background: For adolescents and young adults, a cancer diagnoses can magnify feelings of social isolation at an inherently vulnerable developmental stage. Prior studies have highlighted the importance of peer groups during cancer treatment. Support groups help foster connection and resilience, but patients find in-person participation difficult due to a variety of factors. Additionally, physical changes brought on by cancer makes these patients hesitant to meet in person. The COVID-19 pandemic magnified these difficulties. Virtual reality (VR) allows for the creation of a therapist-curated, computer-generated social space that potentially enables support groups for this population.Objective: This protocol describes a pilot study examining the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a social VR support group intervention for adolescent and young adult patients with cancer. Methods: We approached 20 participants aged 17-20 years, and 16 agreed to participate. Moreover, 1 participant dropped out due to hospitalization. Participants attended virtual, professionally facilitated support groups using Meta Quest VR headsets. The groups consisted of 4 participants and 1 facilitator, amounting to a total of 22 individual sessions. Each session lasted 45-60 minutes and took place weekly for 4-6 weeks. The primary aim of this study was to collect quantitative and qualitative data on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Feasibility was measured through session participation rates and overall retention rates. The acceptability of the intervention was explored through brief in-person interviews with participants at the end of the final intervention session. The secondary aim of this study was to collect data on the preliminary efficacy of the intervention in decreasing symptoms of participant depression and anxiety and increasing positive affect and resiliency.Results: In total, 15 patients aged 17-20 years participated in 22 sessions between November 5, 2019, and July 8, 2021. The median age was 19 (IQR 17-20) years. Overall, 10 (62%) participants identified as male, 5 (31%) as female, and 1 (6%) as transgender female. Furthermore, 5 (31%) participants identified as Hispanic, 1 (6%) identified as non-Hispanic Asian, 3 (19%) identified as non-Hispanic Black, 6 (38%) identified as non-Hispanic White, and 1 (6%) identified as other race or ethnicity. Hematologic malignancies or bone marrow failure was the most common diagnosis (8/16, 50%). The mean attendance rate was 72.8% (SD 25.7%) and retention was 86.7% (SD 0.35%). Moreover, 45% (10/22) of sessions had to be postponed by a week or more due to unexpected participant scheduling issues. Conclusions: The use of VR to deliver psychosocial support for adolescents and young adults with cancer may reduce common barriers associated with attending in-person peer support groups while improving quality-of-life measures. The data from this study will inform future studies focused on conducting VR support groups in other rare disease populations, including older adults with cancer.

Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that is capable of entertaining and distracting the user. Among its many applications, we find the improvement of pain management and the reduction of anxiety in patients undergoing medical interventions. Objective: We aim to publish the protocol of a clinical trial for the reduction of pain and anxiety after the administration of 2 vaccines in children aged 3 to 6 years. Methods: We will conduct a randomized, parallel, controlled clinical trial with 2 assigned groups. The intervention group will wear VR goggles during the administration of 2 vaccines, while the control group will receive standard care from a primary care center for the procedure. Randomization will be carried out by using the RandomizedR computer system-a randomization tool of the R Studio program. This trial will be an open or unblinded trial; both the subjects and the investigators will know the assigned treatment groups. Due to the nature of the VR intervention, it will be impossible to blind the patients, caregivers, or observers. However, a blind third-party assessment will be carried out. The study population will include children aged 3 to 6 years who are included in the patient registry and cared for in a primary care center of the region of Central Catalonia. They will receive the following vaccines during the Well-Child checkup: the triple viral+varicella vaccine at 3 years of age and the hepatitis A+diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine at 6 years of age.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if mobile health technology combined with health coaching can better enable a user to self-manage their mental health.Methods: This study evaluated the mobile app Biofeedback that provided health coaching on stress self-management for college student veterans' mental health concerns. Twenty-four college student veterans were recruited from a large public university in Texas during the spring 2020 semester, impacted by COVID-19. Ten participants were assigned to the intervention group where they used the mobile Biofeedback app on their smartphones and smartwatches, and 14 were assigned to the control group without the app; assignment was based on mobile phone compatibility. Both groups participated in one initial lab session where they learned a deep-breathing exercise technique. The intervention group was then asked to use the mobile Biofeedback app during their daily lives and a smartwatch, and the control group was asked to perform the breathing exercises on their own. Both groups filled out Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) self-assessments at 2-week intervals. At the end of the semester, both groups were given an exit interview to provide user experience and perceived benefits of health coaching via the mobile biofeedback app.Results: The deep-breathing exercise in the initial lab session reduced stress in both groups. Over the course of the study, the app recorded 565 coached breathing exercises with a significant decrease (approximately 3 beats per minute) in participants' heart rate during the 6-minute time period immediately after conducting the breathing exercises (Spearman rank correlation coefficient -0.61, P<.001; S=9,816,176). There was no significant difference between the two groups for PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores over the course of the semester. Exit interview responses indicated that participants perceived that the mobile Biofeedback app improved their health and helped them address stress challenges. All participants reported that the intervention helped them manage their stress better and expressed that health coaching via a mobile device would improve their overall health.Conclusions: Participants reported a positive perception of the app for their mental health self-management during a stressful semester.

Use of a Mobile Peer Support App Among Young People With Nonsuicidal Self-injury: Small-scale Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Kruzan, KP; Whitlock, J; Bazarova, NN; Bhandari, A; Chapman, J",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a widespread behavior among adolescents and young adults. Although many individuals who self-injure do not seek treatment, there is evidence for web-based help-seeking through web-based communities and mobile peer support networks. However, few studies have rigorously tested the efficacy of such platforms on outcomes relevant for NSSI recovery. Objective: The aim of this small-scale preregistered randomized controlled trial is to provide preliminary insight into the shorterand longer-term efficacy of the use of a peer support app, TalkLife, in reducing NSSI frequency and urges and increasing readiness to change. In addition, we explore contact with informal support, interest in therapy, and attitudes toward professional help-seeking. Methods: Individuals aged 16-25 years with current (within 3 months) and chronic (>6 episodes in the past year) NSSI history were eligible to participate in this study. After baseline assessments, the intervention group was instructed to use the app actively (eg, post or comment at least three times per week) and the control group received weekly psychoeducational materials through email, for 8 weeks. Follow-up was assessed at 1 month and 2 months. Linear mixed modeling was used to evaluate condition and time point effects for the primary outcomes of NSSI frequency and urges, readiness to change, contact with informal support, interest in therapy, and attitudes toward professional help-seeking. Results: A total of 131 participants were included in the analysis. We evidenced a significant effect of condition on NSSI frequency such that the participants using the peer support app self-injured less over the course of the study (mean 1.30, SE 0.18) than those in the control condition (mean 1.62, SE 0.18; P=.02; eta(2)=0.02). We also evidenced a significant condition effect of readiness to change such that the treatment participants reported greater confidence in their ability to change their NSSI behavior (mean 6.28, SE 0.41) than the control participants (mean 5.67, SE 0.41; P=.04; eta(2)=0.02). No significant differences were observed for contact with informal support, interest in therapy, or attitudes toward professional help-seeking. Conclusions: Use of the peer support app was related to reduced NSSI frequency and greater confidence in one's ability to change NSSI behavior over the course of the study period, but no effects on NSSI urges, contact with informal support, interest in therapy, or attitudes toward professional help-seeking were observed. The findings provide preliminary support for considering the use of mobile peer support apps as a supplement to NSSI intervention and point to the need for larger-scale trials.",10.2196/26526,wos,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,nonsuicidal self-injury; randomized controlled trial; mobile app; peer support; urges; digital intervention,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/26526)

User-Centered Design of a Digitally Enabled Care Pathway in a Large Health System: Qualitative Interview Study,Not Multi User,"McCue, M; Khatib, R; Kabir, C; Blair, C; Fehnert, B; King, J; Spalding, A; Zaki, L; Chrones, L; Roy, A; Kemp, DE",JMIR HUMAN FACTORS,2023,"rBackground: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Management of chronic conditions such as MDD can be improved by enhanced patient engagement, measurement-based care (MBC), and shared decision-making (SDM). A user-centered design approach can improve the understanding of the patient journey and care team workflows and thus aid the development of digital health care innovations optimized for the needs of patients living with MDD and their primary care teams.Objective: This study aims to use qualitative research methods for the user-centered design of a digitally enabled MDD care platform, PathwayPlatform, intended to enhance patient engagement, MBC, and SDM.Methods: Insights were gathered through 2 stages of qualitative interviews by a study team with expertise in qualitative research and user-centered design methods. Thematic analysis was used to generate an overarching understanding of a set of shared experiences, thoughts, or behaviors across a broad qualitative data set, including transcripts of interviews, to allow both inductive and deductive insights to emerge. Thematic analysis of interviews was supported by Dedoose (SocioCultural Research Consultants, LLC), a qualitative data analysis software tool that enables systematized coding. Findings and insights were presented based on code frequency, salience, and relevance to the research project.Results: In stage 1, interviews were conducted with 20 patients living with MDD and 15 health care providers from September 2018 to January 2019 to understand the experiences with and perceptions about the initial functionality of the Pathway app while also exploring the perceptions about potential additional features and functionality. Feedback about care team workflows and treatment approaches was collected in stage-2 interviews with 36 health care providers at 8 primary care sites. Inductive and deductive thematic analyses revealed several themes related to app functionality, patient-provider engagement, workflow integration, and patient education. Both patients and their care teams perceived the remote tracking of patient-reported outcomes via digital tools to be clinically useful and reliable and to promote MBC and SDM. However, there was emphasis on the need to enhance the flow of real-time data shared with the care team, improve trend visualizations, and integrate the data within the existing clinical workflow and educational programs for patients and their care teams. User feedback was incorporated into the iterative development of the Pathway app.Conclusions: Ongoing communication with patients living with MDD and their care teams provided an opportunity for user-centric developmental iterations of the Pathway Platform. Key insights led to further development of the patient-facing and care team-facing visit preparation features, collaborative goal-setting and goal-tracking features, patient-reported outcome summaries, and trend visualizations.

User-Centered Development of a Mobile App to Assess the Quality of Life of Patients With Cancer: Iterative Investigation and Usability Testing,Not mental health,"Beutter, CNL; Zeller, K; Martens, UM; Pfleiderer, B; Fegeler, C",JMIR CANCER,2023,"Background: The treatment for cancer can have a negative impact not only on physical well-being but also on mental health and the quality of life (QoL). Health apps enable the monitoring of different parameters, but to date, there are only few that support patients with cancer and none that focuses on the assessment of QoL. Furthermore, patients as stakeholders are often only integrated at the late stage of the development process, if at all.Objective: The aim of this research was to develop and evaluate a smartphone app (Lion-App) to enable patients with cancer to autonomously measure the QoL with an iterative, user-centered approach.Methods: Patients with cancer were involved in a 3-stage process from conceptualization to the point when the app was available on the tester's private device. First, focus groups with members (N=21) of cancer support groups were conducted to understand their expectations and needs. Thereafter, individual tests were performed. After developing a prototype that incorporated findings from the focus groups, a second test cycle was conducted, followed by a beta test lasting 2 months. In our app, the QoL can be assessed via a patient diary and an integrated questionnaire. Through all stages, usability was evaluated using the modular extended version of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ+), including the calculation of a key performance indicator (KPI). If possible, the impact of sex on the results was evaluated. As part of the beta test, usage rates as well as age-dependent differences were also assessed.Results: A total of 21 participants took part in the initial 3 focus groups. In the subsequent usability testing (N=18), 17 (94%) participants rated their impression through the UEQ+, with a mean KPI of 2.12 (SD 0.64, range: -3 to 3). In the second usability test (N=14), the mean KPI increased to 2.28 (SD=0.49). In the beta test, the usage rate of 19 participants was evaluated, of whom 14 (74%) also answered the UEQ+ (mean KPI 1.78, SD 0.84). An influence of age on the number of questionnaire responses in Lion-App was observed, with a decrease in responses with increasing age (P=.02). Sex-dependent analyses were only possible for the first usability test and the beta test. The main adjustments based on user feedback were a restructuring of the diary as well as integration of a shorter questionnaire to assess the QoL.Conclusions: The iterative, user-centered approach for development and usability testing resulted in positive evaluations of Lion-App. Our app was rated as suitable for everyday use to monitor the QoL of patients with cancer.

Users' Opinion About a Virtual Reality System as an Adjunct to Psychological Treatment for Stress-Related Disorders: A Quantitative and Qualitative Mixed-Methods Study,Not Multi User,"Guillén, V; Baños, RM; Botella, C",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,2018,"This study aims to explore patients' and therapists' attitudes about the psychological treatment they received (patients) or applied (therapists). The treatments were standard CBT protocols for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), complicated grief (CG), or adjustment disorders (ADs), depending on each patient diagnosis. The treatments were delivered following a traditional format or supported by a virtual reality (VR) system EMMA's WORLD designed for the treatment of stress-related disorders. EMMA's WORLD is a VR application in which patients can explore negative experiences using different virtual elements that can be customized to make them more meaningful to the user. The sample was composed of two groups: the professionals (N = 10) were all clinical psychologists who applied the same psychological treatment in both the traditional format (traditional condition) and using the VR system (EMMA condition). The second group consisted of a sample of patients (N = 50) who met the criteria for at least one of three different diagnoses: PTSD (N = 15), CG (N = 15), or AD (N = 20). 25 patients received treatment in the traditional format and 25 supported by the VR system. The patients were asked about their expectations (before treatment) and satisfaction (after treatment) with the treatment they received. All the therapists were asked their opinions about both treatment conditions. A mixed-methods approach using quantitative and qualitative methodologies was used. In both conditions, high scores were observed, and the patient's opinions were even better when they have already received the treatments. A more pronounced pre-test-post-test change in the EMMA therapy group than in the traditional group was observed. EMMA's World was well-accepted by both patients and therapists, and it helped to foster motivation in patients, while helping the therapist to apply the treatment.

In recent years, MBC has increasingly transitioned to web-based spaces in the form of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), which render high-quality mental health care more accessible nationwide. Although extant research is promising, the emergence of MBC DMHIs means that much is unknown regarding their effectiveness as a treatment for anxiety and depression, particularly among children and adolescents. Objective: This study uses preliminary data from children and adolescents participating in an MBC DMHI administered by Bend Health Inc, a mental health care provider that uses a collaborative care model to assess changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms during participation in the MBC DMHI. Methods: Caregivers of children and adolescents participating in Bend Health Inc for anxiety or depressive symptoms reported measures of their children's symptoms every 30 days throughout the duration of participation in Bend Health Inc. Data from 114 children (age 6-12 years) and adolescents (age 13-17 years) were used for the analyses (anxiety symptom group: n=98, depressive symptom group: n=61). Results: Among children and adolescents participating in care with Bend Health Inc, 73% (72/98) exhibited improvements in anxiety symptoms and 73% (44/61) exhibited improvement in depressive symptoms, as indicated by either a decrease in symptom severity or screening out of completing the complete assessment. Among those with complete assessment data, group-level anxiety symptom T-scores exhibited a moderate decrease of 4.69 points (P=.002) from the first to the last assessment. However, members' depressive symptom T-scores remained largely stable throughout their involvement. Conclusions: As increasing numbers of young people and families seek DMHIs over traditional mental health treatments due to their accessibility and affordability, this study offers promising early evidence that youth anxiety symptoms decrease during involvement in an MBC DMHI such as Bend Health Inc. However, further analyses with enhanced longitudinal symptom measures are necessary to determine whether depressive symptoms show similar improvements among those involved in Bend Health Inc.",10.2196/46154,"pubmed, wos",Pediatrics,digital mental health intervention; anxiety; depression; child; adolescent; collaborative care; mental health; caregiver; pediatric; youth; demographic; health outcome; retrospective; treatment; e-mental health; symptoms,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/46154)
"Using Digital Measurement-Based Care to Address Symptoms of Inattention, Hyperactivity, and Opposition in Youth: Retrospective Analysis of Bend Health",Not Multi User,"Lawrence-Sidebottom, D; Huffman, LG; Huberty, J; Beatty, C; Roots, M; Roots, K; Parikh, A; Guerra, R; Weiser, J",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2023,"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and associated behavioral disorders are highly prevalent in children and adolescents, yet many of them do not receive the care they need. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) may address this need by providing accessible and high-quality care. Given the necessity for high levels of caregiver and primary care practitioner involvement in addressing ADHD symptoms and behavioral problems, collaborative care interventions that adopt a whole-family approach may be particularly well suited to reduce symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and opposition in children and adolescents.Objective: The purpose of this study is to use member (ie, child and adolescent) data from Bend Health, Inc, a collaborative care DMHI that uses a whole-family approach to address child and adolescent mental health concerns, to (1) determine the effects of a collaborative care DMHI on inattention, hyperactivity, and oppositional symptoms in children and adolescents and (2) assess whether the effects of a collaborative care DMHI vary across ADHD subtypes and demographic factors.Methods: Caregivers of children and adolescents with elevated symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or opposition assessed their children's symptom severity approximately every 30 days while participating in Bend Health, Inc. Data from 107 children and adolescents aged 6-17 years who exhibited clinically elevated symptoms at baseline were used to assess symptom severity across monthly assessments (inattention symptom group: n=91, 85.0%; hyperactivity symptom group: n=48, 44.9%; oppositional symptom group: n=70, 65.4%). The majority of the sample exhibited elevated symptoms of at least 2 symptom types at baseline (n=67, 62.6%). Results: Members received care for up to 5.52 months and attended between 0 and 10 coaching, therapy, or psychiatry sessions through Bend Health, Inc. For those with at least 2 assessments, 71.0% (n=22) showed improvements in inattention symptoms, 60.0% (n=9) showed improvements in hyperactivity symptoms, and 60.0% (n=12) showed improvements in oppositional symptoms. When considering group-level change over time, symptom severity decreased over the course of treatment with Bend Health, Inc, for inattention (average decrease=3.51 points, P=.001) and hyperactivity (average decrease=3.07 points, P=.049) but not for oppositional symptoms (average decrease=0.70 points, P=.26). There was a main effect of the duration of care on symptom severity (P<.001) such that each additional month of care was associated with lower symptom scores.Conclusions: This study offers promising early evidence that collaborative care DHMIs may facilitate improvements in ADHD symptoms among children and adolescents, addressing the growing need for accessible and high-quality care for behavioral health problems in the United States. However, additional follow-up studies bolstered by larger samples and control groups are necessary to further establish the robustness of these findings.",10.2196/46578,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,digital mental health intervention; attention-deficit; hyperactivity disorder; opposition defiance disorder; attention deficit; collaborative care; behavioral care; mental health; adolescent; child; hyperactivity; hyperactive; inattention; ADHD; use; caregiver; behavioral problem,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/46578)
Using Smartphone-Based Psychoeducation to Reduce Postnatal Depression Among First-Time Mothers: Randomized Controlled Trial,Other,"Chan, KL; Leung, WC; Tiwari, A; Or, KL; Ip, P",JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2019,"Background: Smartphone-based psychoeducation interventions may be a low-cost, user-friendly alternative to resource-consuming, face-to-face antenatal classes to educate expectant mothers. Objective: This study aimed to empirically examine whether such an intervention would lead to reduced postnatal depression, anxiety, or stress and result in a better health-related quality of life. Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in Hong Kong. All first-time expectant mothers with less than 24 weeks of gestation remaining and attending the antenatal clinic at a public hospital were included. Participants were assigned to the intervention group or the control group by drawing lots. The lots, presented in sealed opaque envelopes, were randomly designated as intervention or control by stratified randomization. The intervention, a psychoeducational mobile app, was provided in addition to the treatment as usual (TAU) services from the hospital. Follow up with participants took place at 4 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome was the difference in the levels of antenatal and postnatal depression, assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The intention-to-treat approach was employed in the analyses. Results: The final sample was 660 expectant mothers ( n(intervention)=330 and n(control)=mean 330). The difference in EPDS scores between the two groups was -0.65 (95% CI -1.29 to 0.00; P=.049) after adjusting for confounding factors. Associations were found between participation in the intervention and reduced depression, and attendance in TAU classes and increased stress levels. Conclusions: The smartphone-based intervention plus TAU services was effective in reducing postnatal depression at 4 weeks postpartum compared with a control condition of TAU only, making this a cost-effective alternative to TAU education for expectant mothers.

However, discomfort in initiating conversations about behavioral health, time concerns, lack of knowledge about screening tools, and treatment resources are barriers. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the impact of an online simulation where users practice role-playing with emotionally responsive virtual patients to learn motivational interviewing strategies to better manage screening, brief interventions, and referral conversations. DESIGN: Baseline data were collected from 227 participants who were then randomly assigned into the treatment or wait-list control groups. Treatment group participants then completed the simulation, postsimulation survey, and 3-month follow-up survey.

Using Virtual Reality to Reduce Anxiety and Improve Hospital Experience in Paediatric Orthopaedic Patients and Their Parents,Not mental health,"Oh, N; Parrish, N; Lee, IW; Temple, S; Perkins, O; Kokkinakis, M",CHILDREN-BASEL,2023,"The hospital environment can be a stressful environment for paediatric patients and their parents, which is often characterised by heightened levels of pain and anxiety. To address these challenges, many innovative intervention methods has been explored. For example, immersive virtual reality (VR) headsets as a distraction method has become an increasingly popular intervention in recent years. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of VR using 'Rescape DR.VR Junior' in reducing pain, anxiety, and enhancing the overall hospital experience for paediatric orthopaedic patients and their parents. A total of 64 patients aged 4-18 years were included in this study, which utilised a control group (interacting with a play specialist) and a VR intervention group (including pre-operative patients and fracture clinic patients). Anxiety and pain levels were measured using a 10-point Likert scale before and after the intervention, and validated questionnaires were used to assess parental anxiety and overall hospital experience. The results indicated that VR intervention significantly reduced patient and parental anxiety both before surgery and in the fracture clinic setting (p < 0.5). However, no significant reduction in pain scores was observed in either environments. Comparatively, VR intervention was found to be comparable to traditional play methods in terms of reducing anxiety in the pre-operative environment. All patients and parents agreed that the use of VR distraction methods significantly improved their hospital experience. In conclusion, VR is an effective method for reducing child and parental anxiety and enhancing the hospital experience and can be used alone or in conjunction with a play specialist.",10.3390/children10081409,"pubmed, wos",Pediatrics,anxiety; virtual reality; paediatric orthopaedics; hospital experience; pain,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3390/children10081409)

Using a Mobile Application in the Treatment of Dysregulated Anger Among Veterans,Other,"Mackintosh, MA; Niehaus, J; Taft, CT; Marx, BP; Grubbs, K; Morland, LA",MILITARY MEDICINE,2017,"Objective: Anger is a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with a range of clinical and functional impairments, and may be especially prevalent among veterans with PTSD. Effective anger management therapies exist but may be undermined by poor engagement or lack of treatment availability. Finding ways to engage veterans in anger management therapy or to improve access can be helpful in improving clinical outcomes. This randomized controlled trial compared anger management treatment (AMT) with AMT augmented by a mobile application (app) system, Remote Exercises for Learning Anger and Excitation Management (RELAX). Methods: Participants were 58 veterans enrolled in 12 sessions of either AMT alone or AMT with the RELAX system (AMT + RELAX). The RELAX system includes the RELAX app, a wearable heart rate monitor, a remote server, and a web-based therapist interface. RELAX allows the user to practice skills, monitor symptoms, and record physiological data. The server collects data on app use. A web-based interface allows the therapist to access data on between-session practice, and skills use. Measures administered at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-and 6-month follow-up include state and trait anger, dimensions of anger, PTSD, depression, interpersonal functioning, and satisfaction. We used multilevel modeling to account for the nesting of time points within participants and participants within treatment groups. Predictors were Treatment Condition (AMT + RELAX and AMT), Linear Time (baseline, post-treatment, 3-and 6-month follow-up), and Quadratic Time and Treatment Condition x Linear Time interaction. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 21 (Armonk, New York). Approval was obtained from the institutional review board. Results: Across groups, the treatment dropout rate was 13.8%; of those who remained in treatment, 90% received an adequate dose of treatment (10 or more sessions). There were no significant differences between groups on attendance or treatment completion. Participants in both treatments demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in anger severity and significant post-treatment reductions in PTSD. Veterans did not report significant changes in depression or interpersonal functioning. Veterans in the AMT + RELAX group reported spending significantly less time on homework assignments, and they rated the AMT + RELAX app as helpful and easy to use, with these ratings improving over time. Conclusion: Findings suggest that AMT + RELAX was beneficial in reducing anger symptoms and promoting efficient use of the between-session practice; however, AMT + RELAX did not outperform AMT. This study is an important contribution as it is one of the first randomized controlled trials to study the efficacy of a technologyenhanced, evidence-based psychotherapy for anger management. Findings are limited because of small sample size and modifications to the technology during the trial. However, the results highlight the possible benefits of mobile app-supported treatment, including increasing the accessibility of treatment, lowering therapist workload, reducing costs of treatment, reducing practice time, and enabling new activities and types of treatments. This study presents preliminary evidence that mobile apps can be a valuable addition to treatment for patients with anger difficulties.

Using a Serious Digital Game to Communicate Drought Risk in Singapore: An Experimental Study,Not mental health,"Ong, C; Araral, E",ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR,2022,"This experimental study tested the effects of digital tactical messaging on 189 undergraduates' drought risk responsiveness using a mobile serious game. In the game's virtual household environment, treatment groups were exposed to message framings informed by risk psychological theories. Drought risk responsiveness was indicated by participants' in-game water consumption levels. The first intervention entailed treatment groups receiving advisories about an impending drought whose magnitude and likelihood varied for different groups. Next, groups would either receive a message reinforcing the efficacy, or social acceptability, of conserving and rationing water during a drought condition. Lastly, groups received a message about a water rationing exercise that they could participate in. Factorial analyses showed that knowing the severity and likelihood of an impending drought did not affect drought risk responsiveness. However, norms- and efficacy-framed messages, as well as rationing exercises, influenced risk responsiveness.

However, few EDs have adequate time and personnel resources to deliver recommended evidence-based assessment and interventions. To raise the clinical standard of care for patients who are suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services in the ED, we developed Jaspr Health, a tablet-based app for direct use by such patients, which enables the delivery of 4 evidence-based practices. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of Jaspr Health among suicidal adults in EDs. Methods: Patients who were acutely suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services participated in an unblinded pilot randomized controlled trial while in the ED. Participants were randomly assigned to Jaspr Health (n=14) or care as usual (control; n=17) groups. Participants were assessed at baseline, and a 2-hour posttest using self-report measures and a semistructured interview were conducted. Results: Conditions differed significantly at baseline with regard to age but not other demographic variables or baseline measures. On average, participants had been in the ED for 17 hours before enrolling in the study. Over their lifetime, 84% (26/31) of the sample had made a suicide attempt (mean 3.4, SD 6.4) and 61% (19/31) had engaged in nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors, with an average rate of 8.8 times in the past 3 months. All established feasibility and acceptability criteria were met: no adverse events occurred, participants' app use was high, Jaspr Health app user satisfaction ratings were high, and all participants using Jaspr Health recommended its use for other suicidal ED patients. Comparisons between study conditions provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of the app: participants using Jaspr Health reported a statistically significant increase in receiving 4 evidence-based suicide prevention interventions and overall satisfaction ratings with their ED experience. In addition, significant decreases in distress and agitation, along with significant increases in learning to cope more effectively with current and future suicidal thoughts, were observed among participants using Jaspr Health compared with those receiving care as usual. Conclusions: Even with limited statistical power, the results showed that Jaspr Health is feasible, acceptable, and clinically effective for use by ED patients who are acutely suicidal and seeking ED-based psychiatric crisis services.",10.2196/23022,wos,Psychiatry,suicide; emergency department; digital technology; suicide prevention,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/23022)

There is a dearth of knowledge on developing evidence-based interventions that address comorbid NCDs using a task-shifting approach. The Friendship Bench, a brief psychological intervention for common mental disorders delivered by trained community grandmothers, is a promising intervention for comorbid NCDs. Although task-shifting appears to be a rational approach, evidence suggests that it may bring about tension between existing professionals from whom tasks are shifted. A Theory of Change approach is an effective way of managing the unintended tension by bringing together different stakeholders involved to build consensus on how to task shift appropriately to the parties involved. We aimed to use a theory of change approach to formulating a road map on how to successfully integrate diabetes and hypertension care into the existing Friendship Bench in order to come up with an integrated care package for depression, hypertension and diabetes aimed at strengthening NCD care in primary health care systems in Zimbabwe. Method A theory of change workshop with 18 stakeholders from diverse backgrounds was carried out in February 2020. Participants included grandmothers working on the Friendship Bench project (n = 4), policymakers from the ministry of health (n = 2), people with lived experience for the three NCDs (n = 4), health care workers (n = 2), and traditional healers (n = 2). Findings from earlier work (situational analysis, desk review, FGDs and clinic-based surveys) on the three NCDs were shared before starting the ToC. A facilitator with previous experience running ToCs led the workshop and facilitated the co-production of the ToC map. Through an iterative process, consensus between the 18 stakeholders was reached, and a causal pathway leading to developing a framework for an intervention was formulated. Results The ToC singled out the need to use expert clients (people with lived experience) to promote a patient-centred care approach that would leverage the existing Friendship Bench approach. In the face of COVID-19, the stakeholders further endorsed the use of existing digital platforms, notably WhatsApp, as an alternative way to reach out to clients and provide support. Leveraging existing community support groups as an entry point for people in need of NCD care was highlighted as a win-win by all stakeholders. A final framework for an NCD care package supported by Friendship Bench was presented to policymakers and accepted to be piloted in five geographical areas. Conclusions The ToC can be used to build consensus on how best to use using an existing intervention for common mental disorders to integrate care for diabetes and hypertension.

"Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy to study effects of virtual reality intervention for adolescents with depression in a clinical setting in China: study protocol for a prospective, randomised, controlled trial",Not Multi User,"Yu, KQ; Wang, LJ; Lv, SQ; Ye, XF; Liu, LH; Zheng, XX; Jin, RM; Zhou, DS; Zhang, Y; Min, GQ; Wu, SC",BMJ OPEN,2023,"Introduction: Adolescent depression has been shown to be associated with many devastating psychosocial outcomes. However, there are many barriers that may prevent depressed individuals from receiving specialised treatment. Virtual reality (VR) technology has shown promise as one avenue for overcoming these challenges. This study first aims to evaluate the effectiveness of VR intervention on adolescent depression symptoms, and second, to determine the intervention's underlying mechanism of effect using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Methods and analysis: This is a single-centre, prospective, randomised controlled clinical trial. Sixty-six eligible adolescents aged 12-18 years with a diagnosis of depression will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the VR treatment group or the conventional treatment group. All patients for both groups will receive usual treatment during a 4-week intervention period. In addition, patients randomised to VR treatment group (n=33) will complete three 20 min VR sessions including attention, executive function and relaxation training per week. Moreover, 33 healthy adolescents will be recruited as the general population. Primary outcome (ie, depressive symptoms) and secondary outcomes (ie, anxiety symptoms, executive function, treatment emergent symptoms, haemoglobin changes measured by fNIRS) will be collected at preintervention, immediately postintervention and at 4 weeks follow-up.

Using mHealth to Increase Treatment Utilization Among Recently Incarcerated Homeless Adults (Link2Care): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Good,"Gonzalez, JMR; Businelle, MS; Kendzor, D; Staton, M; North, CS; Swartz, M",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2018,"Background: There is a significant revolving door of incarceration among homeless adults. Homeless adults who receive professional coordination of individualized care (i.e, case management) during the period following their release from jail experience fewer mental health and substance use problems, are more likely to obtain stable housing, and are less likely to be reincarcerated. This is because case managers work to meet the various needs of their clients by helping them to overcome barriers to needed services (eg, food, clothing, housing, job training, substance abuse and mental health treatment, medical care, medication, social support, proof of identification, and legal aid). Many barriers (eg, limited transportation, inability to schedule appointments, and limited knowledge of available services) prevent homeless adults who were recently released from incarceration from obtaining available case management, crisis management, substance abuse, and mental health services. Objective: The aim of the Link2Care study is to assess the effectiveness of a smartphone app for increasing case management and treatment service utilization, and in turn reduce homelessness and rearrest. The goals of this research are to (1) assess the impact of an innovative smartphone app that will prompt and directly link recently incarcerated homeless adults to community-based case management services and resources and (2) utilize in-person and smartphone-based assessments to identify key variables (eg, alcohol or drug use, social support, psychological distress, and quality of life) that predict continued homelessness and rearrest. Methods: Homeless adults (N=432) who enroll in a shelter-based Homeless Recovery Program after release from the Dallas County Jail will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: (1) usual case management, (2) usual case management plus smartphone, and (3) usual case management with a study-provided smartphone that is preloaded with an innovative case management app (smartphone-based case management). Those assigned to smartphone-based case management will receive smartphones that prompt (twice weekly) connections to shelter-based case managers. The app will also offer direct links to case managers (available during normal business hours) and crisis interventionists (available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) with the touch of a button.

To meet the overwhelming and growing demand for mental health care, innovative approaches must be employed to significantly expand mental health care delivery capacity. Although it is not feasible to increase the number of mental health care providers or hours they work in the short term, improving their time efficiency may be a viable solution. Virtually and digitally delivering psychotherapy, which has been shown to be efficient and clinically effective, might be a good method for addressing this growing demand. Objective: This research protocol aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of using an online, digital, asynchronous care model to treat mental health issues that are started or aggravated by stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This nonrandomized controlled trial intervention will be delivered through the Online Psychotherapy Tool, a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform. Participants will be offered a 9-week electronically delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program that is tailored to address mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This program will involve weekly self-guided educational material that provides an overview of behavioral skills and weekly homework. Participants (N=80) will receive personalized feedback from and weekly interaction with a therapist throughout the course of the program. The efficacy of the program will be evaluated using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires, which are to be completed by participants at baseline, week 5, and posttreatment.

The treatment usually prescribed to people who wish to quit smoking is a multidisciplinary intervention, combining both psychological advice and pharmacological therapy, since the application of both strategies significantly increases the chance of success in a quit attempt. Objective: We present a study protocol of a 12-month randomized open-label parallel-group trial whose primary objective is to analyze the efficacy and efficiency of usual psychopharmacological therapy plus the Social-Local-Mobile app (intervention group) applied to the smoking cessation process compared with usual psychopharmacological therapy alone (control group). Methods: The target population consists of adult smokers (both male and female) attending the Smoking Cessation Unit at Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Seville, Spain. Social-Local-Mobile is an innovative intervention based on mobile technologies and their capacity to trigger behavioral changes. The app is a complement to pharmacological therapies to quit smoking by providing personalized motivational messages, physical activity monitoring, lifestyle advice, and distractions (minigames) to help overcome cravings. Usual pharmacological therapy consists of bupropion (Zyntabac 150 mg) or varenicline (Champix 0.5 mg or 1 mg). The main outcomes will be (1) the smoking abstinence rate at 1 year measured by means of exhaled carbon monoxide and urinary cotinine tests, and (2) the result of the cost-effectiveness analysis, which will be expressed in terms of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Secondary outcome measures will be (1) analysis of the safety of pharmacological therapy, (2) analysis of the health-related quality of life of patients, and (3) monitoring of healthy lifestyle and physical exercise habits. Results: Of 548 patients identified using the hospital's electronic records system, we excluded 308 patients: 188 declined to participate and 120 did not meet the inclusion criteria.

Vagal nerve stimulation for headache,Other,"Venkatakrishnan, S; Thomas, P",CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY,2023,"Purpose of reviewVagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is emerging as a probable therapeutic option for headache. Several questions remain on the mechanism of action, device parameters, efficacy, duration of treatment and long-term safety. This review aims at describing findings of recent literature pertaining to VNS for headache, to put these findings into the perspective of our current fund of knowledge and future scope of work on the topic.Several studies on functional magnetic resonance imaging patterns following VNS in patients with headache have been published, revealing potential biomarkers of headache and possible treatment effects. A study on post-COVID-19 headache and its management with noninvasive cervical VNS adds to the body of original studies. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews outlining previous work have been published. The collection of these studies adds some data to mechanisms of VNS without adding much insight to differential effects of sub-types of VNS and possible device settings that could prove to be beneficial for headache management.Well designed studies are needed to identify mechanisms of action, elicit differential effects of various stimulation parameters, and to demonstrate long-term therapeutic effects and safety of VNS in headache.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:Headache and facial pains are complex clinical conditions that are characterized by multifactorial etiologies which may require multimodal treatments. Headache specialists administer multiple strategies to ease their patients' suffering with medications, interventional procedures, behavioral approaches and lifestyle modifications being the commonly used methods. In the last three decades, important steps have been taken to expand the scope of bioelectric medicine, with significant applications in headache and facial pains. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has emerged as one among the several promising modalities for some headache disorders.The links between the pathobiology of headache and vagal neuromodulation are still being explored and some probable mechanisms of therapeutic benefit have been proposed. These mechanisms include; modulation of the nucleus of tractus solitarius, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus; descending inhibition, inhibition of Cortical Spreading Depression, modulation of trigeminal nucleus, restoration of impaired sensory feedback and amelioration of autonomic symptoms [1,2]. There are few clinical studies that explore the mechanism of action of VNS in headache medicine. Moreover, clinically feasible biomarkers for headache and chronic pains remain elusive.Techniques of vagal nerve stimulation include invasive cervical VNS (i-VNS) via implantable spiral electrodes with the device implanted at the cervical level [3]; transcutaneous cervical stimulation(nVNS/cVNS) with a device such as the gammaCore; transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS/aVNS) at the tragus or cymba concha with the NEMOS device or through different transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) devices [4]; percutaneous auricular stimulation delivered through a dedicated needle electrode or through electroacupuncture needles. The body of published literature is centered mostly around transcutaneous cervical VNS, with emerging evidence for transauricular vagal nerve stimulation. The side effect profile for invasive VNS includes cough, voice change, dysphagia, bradycardia; a pricking sensation at the region of application, neck pain, dizziness, headache, nasopharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain for transcutaneous cervical VNS; and headache, local pain, skin irritation, dizziness for transauricular VNS [1].Pivotal studies in chronic migraine, episodic migraine cluster headache and hemicrania continua have led to device-specific approvals for VNS in the management of these headache sub-types. Feasibility and relative side effect profile of invasive cervical VNS limit its widespread use. The device approvals for transcutaneous device are mainly for cervical stimulation. While transauricular VNS is appealing due to a favorable side effect profile, published evidence for its applications in headache and facial pain is scarce. In addition, most of the published evidence relevant to VNS and headaches are limited to chronic migraine, episodic migraine, chronic tension type headache, hemicrania continua with limited evidence for other primary headache syndromes.In light of recent evidence of unintended side effects of stimulating the vagal nerve, such as exacerbation of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [5] and new onset facial pains [6], any new literature must also be scrutinized for the side effect profile so as to weigh it with the potential benefits.Thus, there remain significant challenges for the clinical application of vagal neuromodulation in headache medicine. Through this review, we aim to explore recently published evidence in basic sciences, neuroimaging and human studies conducted in the field, with reference to headache type, device parameters, location of stimulation and the side effect profile of treatment. no caption availableA study by Liu et al.[2] examined the inhibitory effects of transcutaneous cervical vagal nerve stimulation on cortical spreading depression in rats. The investigators examined the effects of chronic daily stimulation and episodic stimulation with a custom made gammaCore device and used low intensity, medium intensity and high intensity currents to deliver the stimulation (1 V, 11.4 V, 24.4 V respectively). They measured KCl induced cortical depression and its attenuation by the different VNS paradigms. In addition, expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the cortex, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and c-fos in the trigeminal ganglion and the trigeminal nucleus caudalis were measured in the sham stimulation group and in the different treatment groups. The investigators found that, while VNS induced electrophysiological and gene expression related changes with all the paradigms, moderate and high intensity stimulation were more effective than low intensity stimulation. In addition, an anti-inflammatory role of VNS could be deduced by the reduced expression of cortical COX-2, trigeminal ganglion and nucleus caudalis CGRP and c-fos with vagal nerve stimulation.Messina et al.[7] conducted a review on imaging techniques used to evaluate mechanisms and efficacy of treatments used in headache medicine and noted the overall paucity of studies in the field with a note on the lack of clarity on the image patterns that could predict response to treatment.Fu et al.[8] attempted to develop a predictive model for responders of 1 Hz transauricular VNS through a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study. Predictive features were noted in trigeminal cervical complex/rostral ventromedial medulla (TCC/RVM), thalamus, bilateral medial Prefrontal cortex, and temporal gyrus. These features were used to predict the reduction in headache frequency following 4 weeks of ta-VNS with a positive correlation for bilateral prefrontal cortices, right TCC/RVM and left middle cingulate cortex.A similar approach was used by Feng et al.[9] in a larger study involving healthy controls in addition to chronic migraine patients. Fractional amplitude of low frequency features (fALFF) of 60 chronic migraine patients were compared with 60 healthy controls with significant differences in fMRI patterns between the groups. These features were also predictive of response to trans-auricular vagal nerve stimulation.An fMRI-based study by Luo et al.[10] examined the effect of transauricular VNS on functional connectivity between the amygdala and fronto-parietal (FP) cortices of 27 patients with acute migraine. The investigators noted that 8 min of taVNS significantly reduced the functional connectivity (FC) between the amygdala and FP cortex.A meta- analysis by Song et al.[11] identifies that cervical VNS significantly increased the number of patients who had more than 50% reduction in headache days per month. Additionally, transauricular VNS significantly reduced migraine frequency and headache intensity, but did not reduce medication days. The authors cite a study with the finding that low frequency transauricular VNS (1 Hz) was more effective in reducing headache days than stimulation at 25 Hz.A network meta-analysis by Cheng et al.[12] compared different noninvasive brain stimulation, cranial nerve stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation protocols for headache treatment, with the authors concluding that among the different modalities, M1 repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and high frequency occipital nerve stimulation were the most effective in increasing responder rates and reducing monthly migraine days. The authors note that among the studies that used sham stimulation, a significant therapeutic effect from sham stimulation might be relevant for noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation.A review by Straube et al.[13] makes note of the efficacy of noninvasive VNS in episodic migraine and cluster headache - acute and chronic. The study also mentions an interesting trial performed in 2015 by the author himself wherein two different frequencies of VNS- 1 Hz and 25 Hz transauricular VNS were used and the 1 Hz group had more significant reduction in headache days per month and greater numbers of responders than the 25 Hz group. These parameters also find mention in the systematic review by Carvalho et al.[14], in which a frequency of 30 Hz transauricular VNS was also noted to be used for headache management. Both cervical and transauricular VNS find a favorable mention among various neuromodulatory techniques in a review by Tiwari et al.[15].A review by Vilar-Martinez et al.[16] explores the use of noninvasive cervical vagal neuromodulation in rare primary headache syndromes. The review is pertinent as it highlights work done with nVNS for Short acting unilateral neuralgiform headache [17], indomethacin responsive headaches [18] and primary cough headaches [19] that can be refractory to multiple treatments.An alternative to VNS would be auricular electroacupuncture. The topic is explored in a meta-analysis by Fernandez-Hernando et al.[20]. The review notes that while beneficial effects of the technique in chronic migraine have been reported, there is not enough good quality or strong evidence to recommend its routine use.Research conducted by Awaad et al. [21] on the effect of vagal neuromodulation on post coronavirus disease (COVID) headache suggests efficacy of the technique. The study was a randomized controlled trial and used left sided cervical vagal nerve stimulation delivered with a TENS machine as the active intervention and sham stimulation as the control. One concern about the work would be the stimulation parameter used. The investigators used a current of 2 mA intensity, 25 Hz frequency delivered to the neck. This appears problematic as the described settings are relevant for trans-auricular stimulation. However, cervical VNS is known to require a higher frequency and intensity such as 5 kHz burst at burst frequency of 25 Hz and with a 60 mA intensity.Work by Minen et al.[22] explores the possibility using heart rate variability (HRV) in migraine patients as a biofeedback modality. The investigators use a smart-phone based app named Heartmath and explore the feasibility and acceptability of the app as biofeedback therapy for patients with migraine. A similar approach could be used to develop closed loop neuro-modulation systems pairing HRV changes to trigger vagal nerve stimulation.Investigators of a randomized controlled trial titled SAVIOR 1 studied the effects of vagal nerve stimulation on inflammatory markers in patients with acute COVID [23]. Patients in the test group were administered cervical noninvasive VNS and those in the control group received standard of care. Statistically significant reductions in levels of C-reactive protein, Procalcitonin and D-dimer were observed in the VNS group. The study adds evidence to the hypothesis that vagal neuromodulation can have anti-inflammatory effects.VNS has received a lot of attention as a therapeutic modality paired with task-oriented therapy in the improvement of hand function following stroke. A follow-up study by Francesco et al.[24] notes sustained improvements in hand function in stroke survivors with implanted VNS devices, at 2 and 3 years follow up assessments. The mechanism of action of VNS in stroke survivors is thought to be stimulation- mediated modulation of plasticity and learning. The ability of VNS to potentially modulate maladaptive plasticity is relevant for its use in chronic pain and headache syndromes.Recently published literature reveals a trend towards identifying biomarkers for headache and their use in optimizing treatment. The study on rat models of cortical spreading depression and its modulation by VNS gives us a template that can be replicated by researchers interested in the field.Most published clinical evidence for VNS in headache medicine is related to cervical noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation. Studies on other modes - transauricular and minimally invasive auricular stimulation, are limited in number.Stimulation parameters are well described for cervical noninvasive VNS especially by studies employing gammaCore. The standard protocols for episodic migraine are 2-min stimulations at 5 kHz burst with 25 Hz bursting (5 kHz delivered for 40 ms) at about 60 mA. For chronic migraine the 2-min stimulations are delivered over two to three times in a day. Study durations range from 4 weeks to 3 months of treatment.The evidence for transauricular stimulation is less clear. Commonly used frequencies are 1 Hz and 25 Hz. The differential effects of these frequencies are not clear. Stimulation intensity is generally delivered between perception threshold and pain threshold- commonly between 0.5 and 2 mA. The location of stimulation is described as the tragus, cymba-concha, crus of the antihelix and nearby sites [1]. Duration of treatments is also reported between 1 month to 3 months. Long-term efficacy and adverse effect profile are not known.Table 1.

Figures b and c depict clip electrode placement at the tragus and cymba concha, respectively.Most of the published literature is relevant to chronic and episodic migraine, cluster headache, chronic tension-type headache, and hemicrania continua to a limited extent. Sporadic reports on the use of vagal neuromodulation in rare primary headache syndromes are emerging.When one considers the side effect profile of VNS, two additional reviews mention interesting observations. A review by Kharbunda et al.[25] mentions the pro-arrhythmic actions of high-level VNS and antiarrhythmic actions of low-level VNS. It must be noted that intensities of current stimulation reported in headache-related studies fall in the category of low-level VNS.A recent meta-analysis of 10 studies mentions obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as a common side effect of implantable vagal nerve stimulation [5]. The implications of these findings on noninvasive vagal stimulation are unclear. However, caution must be exercised in administering VNS for individuals with OSA/sleep disorders and close surveillance for symptoms of sleep disorders must be done in studies on vagal neuromodulation.Torrealba-Acosta et al.[6] record their findings in a case of facial pain precipitated following the increase of frequency of stimulation in the implanted VNS device. The device was implanted for the treatment of epilepsy and upon increase of frequency to 30 Hz, the patient developed trigeminal neuralgia-like pain. Upon restarting therapy with 20 Hz stimulation the symptoms resolved. This report might give us insight on a likely therapeutic window of stimulation with regards to frequency of VNS administered.The body of literature on vagal nerve stimulation in headache is expanding, however the number of articles is lesser than for transcranial magnetic stimulation applications in headache. Thus, there is scope to conduct research that adds to our understanding on the mechanisms of action, the therapeutic effects of different frequencies in transauricular VNS along with matters of long term efficacy and safety. It is worthwhile exploring the use of closed loop neuromodulation among some areas relevant to vagal neuromodulation as a single bioelectric modality.When one considers the expanding work on peripheral nerve stimulation, transcutaneous trigeminal nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, multifocal cranial nerve stimulation, the possibilities to integrate VNS to a multimodal stimulation paradigm are as promising as they are challenging.As a next step, regulatory bodies, researchers and domain experts in the field could formulate guidelines for conducting research or clinical audits on the use of vagal neuromodulation for headache applications along the lines of the National Institutes of Healthcare and Excellence (NICE) guidelines for transcranial magnetic stimulation use in migraine [26]. Vagal nerve stimulation in headache medicine holds promise. However, there is a need to generate more evidence to gain clarity on the different locations of VNS administration, different stimulation parameters (1 Hz vs. 25 Hz stimulation), comparison with other standard treatments or as on add-on to standard of care, the long-term efficacy and safety profile of the various modes of VNS. How we approach other neuromodulatory treatments and the integration of vagal nerve stimulation with these modes for multimodal bioelectric treatments would be interesting challenges for the future.The authors would like to thank Dr Ria Sabrene Fernandes and Dr Sujatha BK for their assistance with the study.Purpose of reviewVagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is emerging as a probable therapeutic option for headache.

Validation of the InnoWell Platform: Protocol for a Clinical Trial,Other,"Davenport, TA; LaMonica, HM; Whittle, L; English, A; Iorfino, F; Cross, S; Hickie, IB",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2019,"Background: New electronic health technologies are being rapidly developed to improve the delivery of mental health care for both health professionals and consumers and better support self-management of care. We developed a Web-based platform (the InnoWell Platform) that supports the prevention, early intervention, treatment, and continuous monitoring of mental health and maintenance of well-being in people aged 2 years and older. The platform is a customizable digital tool kit that operates through existing service providers who utilize the system to provide their consumers with access to evidence-based assessments and feedback, intervention options, and outcome monitoring. It does this by collecting, storing, and reporting personal and health information back to consumers and their health professionals to promote collaborative care partnerships that aim to improve the management of mental ill health and maintenance of well-being Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the research protocol for a naturalistic prospective clinical trial wherein all consumers presenting for care to a traditional face-to-face or Web-based mental health service in which the InnoWell Platform is being offered as part of standard clinical care will be given the opportunity to use the platform. Methods: The Web-based platform is a configurable and customizable digital tool that assists in the assessment, monitoring and management of mental ill health, and maintenance of well-being. It does this by collecting, storing, and reporting health information back to the person and his or her clinician to enable transformation to person-centered care. The clinical trial will be conducted with individuals aged 2 years and older presenting to participating services for care, including persons from the veteran community, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex community, and those from broader education and workforce sectors, as well as people with disabilities, lived experience of comorbidity, complex disorders, and suicidality. Results: Project Synergy was funded in June 2017, and data collection began in November 2018 at a youth mental health service. At the time of this publication, 5 additional services have also begun recruitment, including 4 youth mental health services and a veteran's service.

"Verbalized Studying and Elaborative Interrogation in the Virtual Classroom: Students with Social Anxiety Prefer Working Alone, but Working with a Peer Does Not Hurt Their Learning",Other,"Novak, RT; Bailey, EG; Blinsky, BD; Soffe, BW; Patterson, D; Ockey, J; Jensen, JL",JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION,2022,"Due to public health measures enacted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, educators and students alike have been suddenly thrust into the realm of online learning. To better understand how active and collaborative learning methods can apply to students studying in isolation, we compared the effects of two teach-and-question assignments: one that utilizes the active learning method of reciprocal peer tutoring and a solo version that requires individual verbalized studying and elaborative interrogation. We used a quasi-experimental design, with student participants enrolled in an online introductory human anatomy course. The first treatment group completed regular teach-and-question study assignments virtually with a peer, and the second treatment group completed the same assignment independently. We found no differences in exam scores between treatments, even for students with high social anxiety; however, student attitudes about the social versus individual assignment did differ for specific types of students. Students who reported experiencing high social anxiety preferred completing the active learning exercise by themselves, and students with low scientific reasoning ability preferred the partnered assignment. This research has potential implications for online classrooms. For instance, our results indicate that students who study independently, or in isolation, may have learning outcomes similar to those of students who study with a peer as long as they study actively. Because we found no negative impact on examination results, it also could be that virtually partnered or independent teach-and-question assignments could be helpful for instructors teaching large online classes to ensure all students are getting individualized feedback and attention.",10.1128/jmbe.00232-21,"pubmed, wos",Education & Educational Research,reciprocal peer tutoring; verbalized studying; social anxiety; elaborative interrogation; online instruction; active learning; collaborative learning; scientific reasoning ability,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.00232-21)
VidaTalk™ patient communication application opened up communication between nonvocal ICU patients and their family,Other,"Shin, JW; Happ, MB; Tate, JA",INTENSIVE AND CRITICAL CARE NURSING,2021,"Objectives: To explore family members' perceptions of an electronic communication application, VidaTalk (TM), their communication experience, and emotional reactions to communication with mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care units. Research methodology/design: Qualitative phase of a mixed-methods study nested within a randomised controlled trial. Family members in the intervention group received the VidaTalk (TM) app as a communication aid during their intensive care stay. Seven family members participated in 18 semi-structured email interviews after discharge between May and December 2018. Interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Setting: Families were recruited in multiple intensive care units located in one university hospital. Main outcome measures: Communication experience with the VidaTalk (TM) and emotions while communicating with the patient. Basic qualitative description and constant comparative techniques were used to code and analyse the text using ATLAS_ti (Version 7.5.18). Findings: The VidaTalk (TM) opened up family-patient communication by allowing clear communication and expanding communication content. Family members felt happy and thankful to communicate with the patient. They also expressed feelings of relief and less frustration and less stress while communicating with the patient. On the other hand, the patient's ability to express their worries or anxiety sometimes made families feel sad or distressed. Conclusion: The VidaTalk (TM) was helpful for family-patient communication. The VidaTalk (TM) may help families reduce psychological distress. However, expanded communication with critically ill patients may cause other negative feelings. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Video directly observed therapy intervention using a mobile health application among opioid use disorder patients receiving office-based buprenorphine treatment: protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial,Other,"Schramm, ZA; Leroux, BG; Radick, AC; Ventura, AS; Klein, JW; Samet, JH; Saxon, AJ; Kim, TW; Tsui, J",ADDICTION SCIENCE & CLINICAL PRACTICE,2020,"Background Office-based buprenorphine treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) does not typically include in-person directly observed therapy (DOT), potentially leading to non-adherence. Video DOT technologies may safeguard against this issue and thus enhance likelihood of treatment success. We describe the rationale and protocol for the Trial of Adherence Application for Buprenorphine treatment (TAAB) study, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effects of video DOT delivered via a smartphone app on office-based buprenorphine treatment outcomes, namely illicit opioid use and retention. Methods Participants will be recruited from office-based opioid addiction treatment programs in outpatient clinics at two urban medical centers and randomized to either video DOT (intervention) delivered via a HIPAA-compliant, asynchronous, mobile health (mHealth) technology platform, or treatment-as-usual (control). Eligibility criteria are: 18 years or older, prescribed sublingual buprenorphine for a cumulative total of 28 days or less from the office-based opioid treatment program, and able to read and understand English. Patients will be considered ineligible if they are unable or unwilling to use the intervention, provide consent, or complete weekly study visits. All participants will complete 13 in-person weekly visits and be followed via electronic health record data capture at 12- and 24-weeks post-randomization. Data gathered include the following: demographics; current and previous treatment for OUD; self-reported diversion of prescribed buprenorphine; status of their mental and physical health; and self-reported lifetime and past 30-day illicit substance use. Participants provide urine samples at each weekly visit to test for illicit drugs and buprenorphine. The primary outcome is percentage of weekly urines that are negative for opioids over the 12-weeks. The secondary outcome is engagement in treatment at week 12. Discussion Video DOT delivered through mHealth technology platform offers possibility of improving patients' buprenorphine adherence by providing additional structure and accountability. The TAAB study will provide important preliminary estimates of the impact of this mHealth technology for patients initiating buprenorphine, as well as the feasibility of study procedures, thus paving the way for further research to assess feasibility and generate preliminary data for design of a future Phase III trial.

Video game-based and conventional therapies in patients of neurological deficits: an experimental study,Not mental health,"Syed, UE; Kamal, A",DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION-ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY,2021,"Purpose: In the past few years, medicine has upgraded its therapeutic techniques and practices, with the use of various modern methods that are due to advancement in technology and sciences. It is recognized that the physical health of the patients is significantly associated to their mental state, their motivation and engagement in overcoming the illness. This paper presents experimental comparison between virtual reality (VR) technology and conventional mode of therapy for physical rehabilitation among patients of neurological deficits. The objective was to explore the effectiveness of VR during physical interactions with different game-like virtual environment and potentially leading to increased mental health (i.e., lower depression, anxiety and stress), self-esteem, social support and intrinsic motivation (task-based competence, choice and interest). Method: The study sample consisted of thirty-four subjects with Cerebral palsy (CP), Traumatic brain injury (TBI), Spinal cord injury, Stroke and Parkinson's disease; divided into two experimental groups virtual reality exercise group (n = 17), and conventional therapy group (n = 17); who have upper- or lower-limb impairment. Results: The outcome measures revealed significant differences across pretest and post-test conditions of both the experimental groups. Findings emerged from the study showed noticeable effectiveness of virtual-reality based rehabilitation in TBI, stroke and CP patients. Relationships between study variables and demographic variables (age and gender) were also presented. Conclusion: This study opens the way for future researchers, psychologists, physiotherapist and other practitioners to do more extensive work in the domain of virtual reality with different sample, constructs and approaches. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION It has become increasing important to introduce new state-to-art technologies in domain of rehabilitation. People are reluctant to use all the traditional modes of treatment. As these conventional ways of treatment are least motivating and interesting to indulge the patients without force and burden. It is evident in the present study that addition of virtual reality-based exercise increases the self-motivated balance during functional task in contrast to conventional and task-dependent training participants. This study opens the way for future researchers to do more extensive work in this domain.",10.1080/17483107.2019.1679266,"pubmed, wos",Rehabilitation,Virtual Reality (VR); MIRA (Medical Interactive Rehabilitation Assistant); physical disability; mental health; self-esteem; motivation,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/17483107.2019.1679266)

Virtual Community Engagement Studio (V-CES): Engaging Mothers With Mental Health and Substance Use Conditions in Research,Not mental health,"Zisman-Ilani, Y; Buell, J; Mazel, S; Hennig, S; Nicholson, J",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2022,"Active engagement of community stakeholders is increasingly encouraged in behavioral health research, often described as a co-production approach. Community stakeholders (e.g., patients, providers, policy makers, advocates) play a leading role together with research investigators in conducting the various phases of research, including conceptualization, design, implementation, and the interpretation and dissemination of findings. The concept of co-production has promising benefits for both the target population and the research outcomes, such as producing person-centered interventions with greater acceptability and usability potential. However, it is often the case that neither researchers nor community members are trained or skilled in co-production methods. The field of behavioral health research lacks tools and methods to guide and promote the engagement of diverse stakeholders in the research process. The purpose of this methods paper is to describe the Virtual Community Engagement Studio (V-CES) as a new method for engaging vulnerable populations like mothers with mental health and substance use conditions in research. We piloted the method in collaboration with the Maternal Mental Health Research Collaborative (MMHRC), focusing on one of the most vulnerable, under-researched populations, mothers coping with mental health and/or substance abuse disorders. Our pilot included mothers and providers who work with them as Community Experts to inform all phases of research design and implementation, and the interpretation and application of findings. The aim of this article is to describe the V-CES as a powerful tool that supports the engagement of mothers with mental health and/or substance use disorders and other community stakeholders in research, to provide examples of its use, and to make recommendations for future use, based on lessons learned. The V-CES toolkit is available for use with this target population as well as others.",10.3389/fpsyt.2022.805781,wos,Psychiatry,community engagement; co-production; parents with mental illness; mothers; mental health; substance use disorder,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.805781)
Virtual Intervention for Caregivers of Persons With Lewy Body Dementia: Pilot Quasi-Experimental Single-Arm Study,Population,"Zaslavsky, O; Kaneshiro, J; Chu, F; Teng, A; Domoto-Reilly, K; Chen, AT",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Compared to other types of dementia, family caregivers of people with Lewy body dementia (LBD) report higher stress levels and more severe depressive symptoms. Although several digital support interventions for caregivers of persons with dementia exist, few target LBD specifically or leverage a fully remote and asynchronous approach suitable for pandemic circumstances. Objective: We performed a pilot evaluation of a digital intervention designed to help caregivers of people with LBD address challenges they have experienced, with the end goal of reducing psychological distress in this population. Methods: We recruited 15 family caregivers of people with LBD to participate in the quasi-experimental, single-arm, mixed methods study titled Virtual Online Communities for Aging Life Experience-Lewy Body Dementia (VOCALE-LBD). The study offers an 8-week web-based intervention that uses a digital discussion platform and involves moderation, peer-to-peer support, didactic training, and problem-solving skill enactment. Results: Participants' baseline characteristics were the following: mean age 66 (SD 8) years; 14 of 15 (93%) of them were female; all (15/15, 100%) were White; and 8 (53%) of them had at least a postgraduate degree. Throughout the intervention, participants engaged in weekly web-based discussions, generating a total of 434 posts (average 4 posts per week). Attrition was 20% (3/15). Upon study exit, participants showed the following average improvements: 3.0 (SD 6.0) in depression, 8.3 (SD 16.7) in burden, 2.9 (SD 6.8) in stress, and 0.3 (SD 0.8) in loneliness. When looking at the proportion of participants with clinically significant improvement versus those with a worsening of =0.5 SD for each outcome, we observed net improvements of 50% (6/12), 33% (4/12), 25% (3/12), and 25% (3/12) in depression, loneliness, burden, and stress, respectively. In terms of the benefits of participation, participants reported that participation helped them a great deal to (1) improve their understanding of LBD (9/12, 75%), (2) gain confidence in dealing with difficult behaviors of the care recipient (6/12, 50%), and (3) improve in one's abilities to provide care to the care recipient (4/12, 33%). Conclusions: The study generated promising feasibility and preliminary efficacy data for a low-cost, web-based intervention designed for caregivers of persons with LBD. Though the study was not powered for significance, we observed nominal average and net improvements in important psychological outcomes. Moreover, many caregivers reported that study participation helped them better understand the disease, feel more confident in dealing with difficult behaviors of the care recipient, and improve their ability to care for the care recipient. If validated in future studies, the intervention could be an accessible, on-demand resource for caregivers, enabling them to engage in moderated remote discussions with peers at their own convenience in terms of location, time of the day, and frequency.",10.2196/37108,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,dementia; caregiver; internet based; digital health; digital intervention; eHealth; feasibility; web-based; peer support; didactic training; caregiving; informal care; spousal care; remote intervention; Lewy body; Lewy bodies; discussion forum; discussion platform; online support; distress; stress reduction; online discussion; support group; discussion group; burden; depression; depressive symptom; lonely; loneliness; mental health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/37108)
Virtual Learning Collaborative Compared to Technical Assistance as a Strategy for Implementing Health Promotion in Routine Mental Health Settings: A Hybrid Type 3 Cluster Randomized Trial,Other,"Bartels, SJ; Aschbrenner, KA; Pratt, SI; Zubkoff, L; Jue, K; Williams, G; Godfrey, MM; Cohen, MJ; Banerjee, S; Xie, HY; Wolfe, R; Naslund, JA; Bond, GR",ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY IN MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,2022,"Background Despite widespread use of learning collaboratives, few randomized trials have evaluated their effectiveness as a strategy for implementing evidence based practices. This randomized trial evaluated the effectiveness of a virtual learning collaborative (VLC) in the implementation of a health promotion program for persons with serious mental illness (SMI) aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk reduction in routine mental health settings, compared to routine technical assistance (TA). Methods Fifty-five mental health provider organizations were recruited to participate in a Hybrid Type 3 cluster randomized implementation-effectiveness trial of the InSHAPE health promotion program for persons with SMI. Sites were stratified by size and randomized prior to implementation to an 18-month group-based VLC with monthly learning sessions or individual site TA with four scheduled conference calls over 18 months. Primary implementation and service outcomes were InSHAPE program fidelity, participation, and reach. Primary clinical outcomes were weight loss, cardiorespiratory fitness, and cardiovascular risk reduction (>= 5% weight loss or > 50 m increase on the 6-Minute Walk Test). Program fidelity was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months; program participation and participant-level outcomes were assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results VLC (N = 27) and TA (N = 28) sites were similar in organizational characteristics (all p > 0.05). At 12-month follow-up mean program fidelity score was higher in VLC compared to TA (90.5 vs. 79.1; p = 0.002), with over double the proportion with good fidelity (VLC = 73.9% vs. TA = 34.8%; p = 0.009). Over half of individuals in both VLC and TA achieved cardiovascular risk-reduction at 6-month follow-up (VLC: 51.0%; TA: 53.5%; p = 0.517) and at 12-month follow-up (62% VLC and TA; p = 0.912). At 12-month follow-up VLC compared to TA was associated with greater participation (VLC 69.5% vs. TA 56.4% attending at least 50% of sessions, p = 0.002); larger caseloads (VLC = 16 vs. TA = 11; p = 0.024); greater reach consisting of 45% greater number of participants receiving InSHAPE (VLC = 368 vs. TA = 253), and 58% greater number of participants achieving cardiovascular risk reduction (VLC = 150 vs. TA = 95). Conclusion Virtual learning collaboratives compared to routine technical assistance as an implementation strategy for evidence-based health promotion promote greater intervention fidelity, greater levels of intervention participation, greater reach, and a greater number of participants achieving clinically significant risk reduction outcomes, while achieving similarly high levels of intervention effectiveness for participants who completed at least 6 months of the program.",10.1007/s10488-022-01215-0,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Implementation strategy; Learning collaborative; Fidelity; Technical Assistance; Technology; Serious mental illness; Health promotion; Reach; Effectiveness,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10488-022-01215-0)
Virtual Mind-Body Programming for Patients With Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Study,Not mental health,"Emard, N; Lynch, KA; Liou, KT; Atkinson, T; Green, AK; Daly, B; Trevino, K; Mao, JJ",JMIR CANCER,2021,"Background: Patients with cancer are particularly vulnerable to stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing is critical for patients with cancer; however, it can also reduce their access to psychosocial coping resources. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore patient experiences to generate a model of how virtual mind-body programs can support the psychosocial well-being of patients with cancer. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study among patients (aged >= 18 years) who participated in a virtual mind-body program offered by a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program consisted of mind-body group therapy sessions of fitness, yoga, tai chi, dance therapy, music therapy, and meditation. Live integrative medicine clinicians held each session via Zoom videoconferencing for 30-45 minutes. In semistructured phone interviews (n=30), patients were asked about their overall impressions and perceptions of the benefits of the sessions, including impacts on stress and anxiety. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. Results: Among the 30 participants (average age 64.5 years, SD 9.36, range 40-80, 29 female), three major themes were identified relating to experiences in the virtual mind-body program: (1) the sessions helped the patients maintain structured routines and motivated them to adhere to healthy behaviors; (2) the sessions enhanced coping with COVID-19-related-stressors, allowing patients to refocus and re-energize; and (3) the sessions allowed patients to connect, fostering social relationships during a time of isolation. These themes informed the constructs of a novel behavioral-psychological-social coping model for patients with cancer. Conclusions: Virtual mind-body programming supported patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic through a behavioral-psychological-social coping model by enhancing psychological coping for external stressors, supporting adherence to motivation and health behaviors, and increasing social connection and camaraderie. These programs have potential to address the behavioral, psychological, and social challenges faced by patients with cancer during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The constructs of the conceptual model proposed in this study can inform future interventions to support isolated patients with cancer.

More flexible and pragmatic support are needed for their optimized recovery. We examined the effects of a virtual multidisciplinary stroke care clinic on survivors' health and self-management outcomes.METHODS:A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Survivors were recruited from 10 hospitals and randomized at 1:1 ratio into the intervention or the control groups. Intervention group participants received the Virtual Multidisciplinary Stroke Care Clinic service (monthly online consultations with a nurse, follow-up phone calls, and access to an online platform). Control group participants received the usual care. Outcomes of self-efficacy (stroke self-efficacy questionnaire; primary), self-management behaviors (Stroke Self-Management Behaviors Performance Scale), social participation (reintegration to normal living index), and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; secondary) were measured at baseline, and 3 and 6 months after commencing the intervention (post-randomization). A generalized estimating equations model was used to compare the differential changes in outcomes at 3 and 6 months with respect to baseline between 2 groups.RESULTS:Between July 2019 and June 2022, 335 eligible participants were enrolled in the study. Participants (intervention group; n=166) showed significantly greater improvements in outcomes of self-efficacy (group-by-time interaction regression coefficient, B=4.60 [95% CI, 0.16 to 9.05]), social participation (B=5.07 [95% CI, 0.61 to 9.53]), and depression (B=-2.33 [95% CI, -4.06 to -0.61]), and no significant improvement in performance of self-management behaviors (B=3.45, [95% CI, -0.87 to 7.77]), compared with the control group (n=169) right after the intervention (6 months after its commencement). Hedges' g effect sizes of the intervention on outcomes: 0.19 to 0.36.CONCLUSIONS:The results provide some positive evidence on the usefulness of the Virtual Multidisciplinary Stroke Care Clinic service. The effect sizes are regarded as small to medium, which may not be of clinical relevance. The baseline levels in outcomes were in favor of the control group, the intervention effects might be overestimated.

Method: Participants with a principal diagnosis of social anxiety disorder who identified public speaking as their primary fear (N = 97) were recruited from the community, resulting in an ethnically diverse sample (M age = 39 years) of mostly women (62%). Participants were randomly assigned to and completed 8 sessions of manualized virtual reality exposure therapy, exposure group therapy, or wait list. Standardized self-report measures were collected at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up, and process measures were collected during treatment. A standardized speech task was delivered at pre- and posttreatment, and diagnostic status was reassessed at 3-month follow-up. Results: Analysis of covariance showed that, relative to wait list, people completing either active treatment significantly improved on all but one measure (length of speech for exposure group therapy and self-reported fear of negative evaluation for virtual reality exposure therapy). At 12-month follow-up, people showed significant improvement from pretreatment on all measures. There were no differences between the active treatments on any process or outcome measure at any time, nor differences on achieving partial or full remission.

This exploratory study investigated the effects of virtual reality exposure training on students with music performance anxiety. Seventeen music students were randomly assigned to a control group (n=8) or a virtual training group (n=9). Participants were asked to play a musical piece by memory in two separate recitals within a 3-week interval. Anxiety was then measured with the Personal Report of Confidence as a Performer Scale and the S-Anxiety scale from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y). Between pre- and post-tests, the virtual training group took part in virtual reality exposure training consisting of six 1-hour long sessions of virtual exposure. The results indicate a significant decrease in performance anxiety for musicians in the treatment group for those with a high level of state anxiety, for those with a high level of trait anxiety, for women, and for musicians with high immersive tendencies.

Current best practice is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but there are several challenges associated with performing exposure therapy. Virtual reality exposure (VRE) may improve treatment efficacy of SAD in a group therapy context, because it allows for greater control, flexibility, and individualization of the exposure stimuli. However, to date no study has investigated the use of VRE for SAD in a group context. In the present study, nine patients who had undergone group CBT with VRE for SAD and three therapists responsible for the treatment were interviewed about their experiences. The objective of the study was to investigate the practical and therapeutic challenges of using VRE in a group therapy context. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. The results showed that it was difficult for the patients to engage with the VRE in a group therapy context and that there were several practical challenges. However, all participants found the VRE exercises to be meaningful, because it gave them a medium to practice and understand typically avoided social situations.

Virtual Reality Group Therapy for the Treatment of Depression: A Qualitative Study on Stakeholder Perspectives,Good,"Dilgul, M; Hickling, LM; Antonie, D; Priebe, S; Bird, VJ",FRONTIERS IN VIRTUAL REALITY,2021,"Background: Cognitive behavioral group therapy alleviates depression by teaching patients to think and behave in more positive ways. Teletherapy (e.g., Zoom) is becoming more widely used, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic (where meeting in person is not safe). The current study explores the acceptability of taking teletherapy to the next level: Virtual Reality Group Therapy (VRGT).Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore stakeholder views on VRGT. Ten depressed patients and ten therapists watched a demonstration video of the proposed VRGT intervention and tested the VR application using a stand-alone VR headset. In VRGT, patients will use an avatar to interact with each other and with their therapist via networked multiparticipant VR.Results: Therapists and patients generally responded favorably to the idea of doing group therapy sessions in VR. Patients especially liked the idea of remaining anonymous via an avatar. Patients and therapists both indicated that the anonymity provided by avatars could increase patient's willingness to make disclosures (to talk more freely and honestly), which could increase participation and could lead to better group cohesion.Conclusion: Although the findings suggested that VRGT may be more acceptable for some patients than for others, overall, the response of the patients and therapists was largely positive. Recommendations from this study could be used during the COVID-19 pandemic to deliver VRGTs.

Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether virtual reality distraction intervention can alleviate pain and anxiety and reduce length of procedure among pediatric cancer patients undergoing PIC. Methods One hundred eight pediatric cancer patients aged 6 to 17 years were recruited from a regional public hospital in Hong Kong to participate in this randomized controlled trial. The intervention group received virtual reality distraction intervention, and the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was child-reported pain. Secondary outcomes included child-reported anxiety, pulse rate, and length of procedure. Outcome measurements were conducted at 5 minutes before, during, and immediately after the procedure. Results Pediatric cancer patients in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in pain (estimated mean difference = -1.69, P = .007) and anxiety levels (estimated mean difference = -3.50, P < .001) compared with the control group. The mean duration (in minutes) for the PIC procedure was significantly shorter among participants receiving virtual reality intervention compared with the control counterparts (estimated mean difference = -0.75, P = .017). However, no significant difference was observed in pulse rate during and after the procedure between groups.

Design: A pilot, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial. Setting: Stroke rehabilitation inpatient unit. Participants: Participants (N=48) with hemiplegia secondary to a unilateral stroke for >3 months and with a hemiplegic wrist extensor Medical Research Council scale score ranging from 1 to 3. Interventions: FES was applied to the wrist extensors and finger extensors. A VR-based wearable rehabilitation device was used combined with FES and virtual activity based training for the intervention group. The control group received cyclic FES only. Both groups completed 20 sessions over a 4-week period. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measures were changes in Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity and Wolf Motor Function Test scores. Secondary outcome measures were changes in Box and Block Test, Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test, and Stroke Impact Scale scores. Assessments were performed at baseline (t0) and at 2 weeks (t1), 4 weeks (t4), and 8 weeks (t8). Between-group comparisons were evaluated using a repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: Forty-one participants were included in the analysis. Compared with FES alone, VR-FES produced a substantial increase in Fugl-Meyer Assessment distal score (P=.011) and marginal improvement in Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test gross score (P=.057). VR-FES produced greater, although nonsignificant, improvements in all other outcome measures, except in the Stroke Impact Scale activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living score.

This study was conducted to compare VR to standard iPad use after surgery and examine its effect on pain score and opioid consumption. Methods This was a randomized controlled study, with stratification by surgery type, age group (7-12yo, 13-18yo) and gender. Pain and anxiety were assessed with validated scales (STAI, FACES, VAS, FLACC) and outcomes were compared between each group. Results 50 of the 106 enrolled patients used the VR device. After adjusting for age, gender, and STAI, patients had a decreased FLACC score while using the VR device compared to the iPad group (odds ratio 2.95, P = .021). The younger patients were found to have lower FLACC scores while using the VR device (odds ratio 1.15, p=0.044); this finding was most significant when patients used the VR device for 20-30 minutes (odds ratio 1.67, P = .0003).

To address CACS patient concerns regarding their experience of care, our cancer center established a specialized CACS clinic in 2016. We applied the team science principle of the team mental model (TMM) to support development of an effective interprofessional collaborative CACS care team. In 2020, cessation of CACS clinic in-person visits during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatened the viability of the entrenched TMM and once again jeopardized the patient experience of care. We present a case-based vignette as a representative composite of patient experiences to illustrate the challenges. A 48-year-old female was referred to our CACS clinic for pancreatic cancer-associated appetite and weight loss during COVID-19. To reduce risk of infection, in-person clinic visits were curtailed. When informed about the resulting need to defer the CACS assessment, the patient and her spouse expressed concern that postponement would adversely affect her ability to undergo anticancer treatments or achieve beneficial outcomes. To minimize delays in CACS treatment and optimize the patient experience of care, we applied the team science principle of sense-making to help the team rapidly reformulate the TMM to provide interprofessional collaborative CACS care via telemedicine.

Background The School of Nursing faculty in a South Central University in the United States quickly combined innovation with digital resources and transitioned a course in population health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing faculty were challenged to develop student nursing objectives in assessment, planning, intervention and evaluation of vulnerable populations in the community through a virtual environment. Reflections of population health nursing clinical education The experiences of five clinical groups are described, covering adults with disabilities, older people, patients with COVID-19 and youth populations. Discussion The course objectives were met through use of a digital environment. Collaborative interventions were designed and implemented with community stakeholders while maintaining social distancing policies. Successes included increased frequency of communication and learning opportunities for students and the community, and student satisfaction. Barriers to student learning were not related to the digital learning environment, although the older adults required modifications to use electronic devices. Conclusion Virtual classrooms are a viable platform to teach population health nursing and to benefit vulnerable populations.

MethodsForty-four parents were invited to attend 2-h-long vPLPSG sessions every other week for 6 months. A convergent mixed methods design was used to integrate quantitative survey data (collected at three timepoints and analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA) and qualitative interview data (collected at 6 months and analyzed using content analysis) to assess intervention feasibility. Feasibility was comprised of acceptability (e.g., recruitment and retention rates, desire to continue attending the groups) and preliminary effectiveness (e.g., change in parents' self-reported burden). ResultsThe recruitment rate (67%), retention rate (77%), and attendance rate (60%) demonstrated adequate acceptability. All parents expressed their recommendation of this group to other parents, and most wanted to continue attending vPLPSG sessions. Participants qualitatively reported less isolation and burden as well as improvements in skills and confidence to manage their child's symptoms.

Commonly, patients receive deep propofol sedation during these cases, leading to potentially avoidable risks of over-sedation, hypotension, upper airway obstruction, and apnea. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of VR technology to promote relaxation for patients undergoing upper extremity surgery, thereby reducing intraoperative anesthetic requirements and improving the perioperative patient experience. Methods In this single-center, randomized controlled trial, 40 adult patients undergoing upper extremity orthopedic surgery will be randomly allocated to either intraoperative VR immersion or usual care. VR immersion is designed to provide patients with a relaxing virtual environment to alleviate intraoperative anxiety. All patients receive a peripheral nerve block prior to surgery. Patients in the intervention group will select videos or immersive environments which will be played in the VR headset during surgery. An anesthesia provider will perform their usual clinical responsibilities intraoperatively and can administer anesthetic medications if and when clinically necessary. Patients in the control arm will undergo perioperative anesthesia according to standard care practice. The primary outcome is the difference in intraoperative propofol dose between the groups. Secondary outcomes include postoperative analgesia requirements and pain scores, length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit, overall patient satisfaction and postoperative functional outcomes. Discussion It is unknown whether the use of VR during upper extremity surgery can reduce intraoperative anesthetic requirements, reduce perioperative complications, or improve the postoperative patient experience. A positive result from this clinical trial would add to the growing body of evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of VR as an adjunct to anesthesia in reducing intraoperative pain and anxiety for multiple types of procedure. This could lead to a change in practice, with the introduction of a nonpharmacologic intervention potentially reducing the burden of over-sedation while still providing a satisfactory perioperative experience.",10.1186/s13063-019-3922-2,"pubmed, wos",Research & Experimental Medicine,Propofol; Virtual reality; Monitored anesthesia care; Regional; Upper extremity surgery,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-019-3922-2)
Virtual reality environment using a dome screen for procedural pain in young children during intravenous placement: A pilot randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Lee, HN; Bae, W; Park, JW; Jung, JY; Hwang, S; Kim, DK; Kwak, YH",PLOS ONE,2021,"We assessed the feasibility and potential efficacy of a virtual reality (VR) environment using a dome screen as a distraction method in young children during intravenous (IV) placement in the pediatric emergency department. This randomized controlled pilot study enrolled children aged 2 to 6 years who underwent IV placement into either the intervention group or the control group. Children in the intervention group experienced VR using a dome screen during IV placement. The child's pain intensity was measured using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale at four time points of IV placement: immediately after arrival to the blood collection room (base); immediately after the child laid down on the bed (preparation); when the tourniquet was applied (tourniquet); and the moment at which the needle penetrated the skin (venipuncture). The guardian's satisfaction and rating of the child's distress were assessed using a 5-point Likert-type questionnaire. We recruited 19 children (9 in the intervention group and 10 in the control group). Five children in the control group were excluded from the analysis because of missing video recordings (n = 3), failed first attempt at IV placement (n = 1), and the child's refusal to lie on the bed during the procedure (n = 1). No side effects of VR were reported during the study period. Although the average FLACC scale score at each time point (preparation, tourniquet, venipuncture) was lower in the intervention group than the control group, the difference was not statistically significant (2.3, interquartile range [IQR]: 2.0-3.0; vs. 3.3, IQR: 2.7-6.7, P = 0.255). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the guardian's satisfaction and anxiety or his/her rating of the child's pain and anxiety. The guardians and emergency medical technicians reported satisfaction with the use of VR with a dome screen and considered it a useful distraction during the procedure. VR using a dome screen is a feasible distraction method for young children during IV placement.

Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with subjects, who had completed phase II, randomly assigned to intervention group 1 (IG1), whose program encompassed the use of Kinect (n = 11); or intervention group 2 (IG2), a paper booklet (n = 11); or a control group (CG), only subjected to the usual care (n = 11). The three groups received education on cardiovascular risk factors. The assessed parameters, at baseline (M0), 3 (M1) and 6 months (M2), were executive function, control and integration in the implementation of an adequate behaviour in relation to a certain objective, specifically the ability to switch information (Trail Making Test), working memory (Verbal Digit Span test), and selective attention and conflict resolution ability (Stroop test), quality of life (MacNew questionnaire) and depression, anxiety and stress (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21). Descriptive and inferential statistical measures were used, significance level was set at.05. Results: The IG1 revealed significant improvements, in the selective attention and conflict resolution ability, in comparison with the CG in the variable difference M0 - M2 (p =.021) and in comparison with the IG2 in the variable difference M1 - M2 and M0 - M2 (p =.001 and p =.002, respectively). No significant differences were found in the quality of life, and depression, anxiety and stress. Conclusions: The virtual reality format had improved selective attention and conflict resolution ability, revealing the potential of CR, specifically with virtual reality exercise, on executive function.

However, there is little known about the effectiveness of an interactive multimodal therapy in VR for older chronic back pain (CBP) patients. The aim of the exploratory randomized controlled trial was to examine the preliminary effectiveness of a VR multimodal therapy for older adults with CBP in a laboratory setting over a period of four weeks. The intervention group (IG; n = 11) received a multimodal pain therapy in VR (movement therapy and psychoeducation) and the control group (CG; n = 11) received a conventional multimodal pain therapy (chair-based group exercises and psychoeducation in a group setting). Although the VR therapy (IG) did not reach the pain intensity reduction of the CG (IG: MD = 0.64, p = .535; CG: MD = 1.64, p = .07), both groups showed a reduction in pain intensity on the Numeric Rating Scale.

Virtual reality exposure and response prevention in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder in patients with contamination subtype in comparison with in vivo exposure therapy: a randomized clinical controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Javaherirenani, R; Mortazavi, SS; Shalbafan, M; Ashouri, A; Farani, AR",BMC PSYCHIATRY,2022,"Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by disturbing and unwanted thoughts as well as repetitive and time-consuming behaviors that interfere with performance. Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) has shown to have beneficial effects on reducing OCD symptoms as the first line of treatment. Moreover, Virtual Reality (VR) has been a more feasible and accessible intervention for OCD in recent years. Regarding the point, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality exposure and response prevention (VRERP) in the treatment of the OCD contamination subtype. Methods: A total number of 36 adults with OCD-contamination subtype were registered and randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The intervention group received a 60-min CBT including a contaminatedvirtual environment while the control group received CBT as a standardized treatment. Out of these, 29 patients completed the treatment in 12 weekly sessions. The patients completed the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire-44(OBQ-44), and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale-2 (WHODAS-2) at week 0, week 12 and after 3 months follow-up. Results: Based on the results of the repeated measure analysis of variances, the total score of obsession and compulsion subscales of Y-BOCS significantly decreased as a primary outcome in the intervention group (F = 60.97, P < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.82; F = 20.46, P < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.61; F = 29.57, P <0.001, partial eta squared = 0.69; respectively). The total score of BDI-II and BAI was reduced in both groups but there was no significant difference between them (BDI-II: F = 0.54, P = 0.47, partial eta squared = 0.02; BAI: F = 3.12, P = 0.06, partial eta squared =0.19).

Virtual reality exposure in the treatment of fear of flying,Good,"da Costa, RT; Sardinha, A; Nardi, AE",AVIATION SPACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE,2008,"Background: Recently, a growing body of research has appeared on different aspects of virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy applied to the treatment of anxiety disorders. The purpose of this article was to review with a systematic methodology the evidences that support the potential effectiveness of this therapy in the treatment of fear of flying (FOF), a problem that significantly affects patients' social functioning and personal welfare. Methods: Potential studies were identified via computerized search using the PubMed/Medline and Web of Science databases, and additional review of their references. Articles ranged from 1969 to 2007 and the keywords used in the search were: virtual reality and fear of flying; virtual reality and flying phobia; or virtual reality and flight phobia. Results: There were 40 studies using VRE in the treatment of FOF identified, mostly on the effectiveness of VRE therapy in group and case studies. Several components of the treatment protocols differed among the studies, which made the results comparison a challenging task. Nevertheless, controlled studies demonstrate that VRE treatment is effective with or without cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and/or psychoeducation and that it is considered to be an effective component of the treatment of FOF. Conclusions: All studies that used cognitive and relaxation techniques in addition to VRE treatment were effective. More randomized clinical trials are required in which VRE therapy could be compared with standard exposure therapy.

Virtual reality exposure therapy as treatment for pain catastrophizing in fibromyalgia patients: proof-of-concept study (Study Protocol),Not mental health,"Morris, LD; Grimmer-Somers, KA; Spottiswoode, B; Louw, QA",BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS,2011,"Background: Albeit exercise is currently advocated as one of the most effective management strategies for fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS); the implementation of exercise as a FMS treatment in reality is significantly hampered by patients' poor compliance. The inference that pain catastrophizing is a key predictor of poor compliance in FMS patients, justifies considering the alteration of pain catastrophizing in improving compliance towards exercises in FMS patients. The aim of this study is to provide proof-of-concept for the development and testing of a novel virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) program as treatment for exercise-related pain catastrophizing in FMS patients. Methods: Two interlinked experimental studies will be conducted. Study 1 aims to objectively ascertain if neurophysiological changes occur in the functional brain areas associated with pain catastrophizing, when catastrophizing FMS subjects are exposed to visuals of exercise activities. Study 2 aims to ascertain the preliminary efficacy and feasibility of exposure to visuals of exercise activities as a treatment for exercise-related pain catastrophizing in FMS subjects. Twenty subjects will be selected from a group of FMS patients attending the Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa and randomly allocated to either the VRET (intervention) group or waiting list (control) group. Baseline neurophysiological activity for subjects will be collected in study 1 using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In study 2, clinical improvement in pain catastrophizing will be measured using fMRI (objective) and the pain catastrophizing scale (subjective). Discussion: The premise is if exposing FMS patients to visuals of various exercise activities trigger the functional brain areas associated with pain catastrophizing; then as a treatment, repeated exposure to visuals of the exercise activities using a VRET program could possibly decrease exercise-related pain catastrophizing in FMS patients. Proof-of-concept will either be established or negated.

Sixty-six children aged 6-16 years who needed intravenous placement received VR, or standard of care in the ED (videos, television, iPad, child life specialist). Outcome measures included change in pain score, level of anxiety, patient and parent satisfaction (pain and anxiety), number of trials, and procedure time. Compared with controls, the intervention group had similar age, sex, number of trials, and anesthetic use. Time of procedure was shorter in the VR group (median 5 min) but this was not statistically significant compared with 7 min for the control group. Pain in the intervention group was lower, even before the procedure. Difference in pain (before and after) and anxiety (after the procedure) were similar in both groups. Satisfaction from anxiety management was higher for the VR group (p< 0.007) and children rated VR significantly more fun (p< 0.024).

Evidence suggests that increased distress during ICU stay increases risk of PICS-F, resulting in difficulty returning to their normal lives after the ICU experience. Effective interventions to improve PICS-F are currently lacking. In the present trial, we hypothesised that information provision using ICU-specific Virtual Reality for Family members/relatives (ICU-VR-F) may improve understanding of the ICU and subsequently improve psychological well-being and quality of life in relatives of patients admitted to the ICU. Methods and analysis This multicentre, clustered randomised controlled trial will be conducted from January to December 2021 in the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We aim to include adult relatives of 160 ICU patients with an expected ICU length of stay over 72 hours.

Virtual reality hypnosis for postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty,Not Multi User,"Depauw, L; Bosteels, A; Maes, S; Sermeus, L; Saldien, V",ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA BELGICA,2020,"Background and aims: Postoperative pain frequently occurs after total knee arthroplasty. This is a major cause of distress after surgery and often causes complications such as persistent pain. Adequate management of postoperative pain is therefore mandatory. Virtual Reality (VR) is a non-pharmacological way to decrease pain in a number of different situations, with the extended benefit of no opioid related side effects. VR can also be used as a method to induce therapeutic hypnosis, which enables the patients to be in control of their pain using (self-)induced hypnosis. Methods : The VR4POPKA (Virtual Reality for Post-Operative Pain management after Knee Arthroplasty) trial was set up as an interventional. randomized. controlled, single centre, double blind, parallel group superiority trial. Eligible patients are assigned to standard treatment group with a sham VR program or standard treatment with VR hypnosis.

During TAVI under conscious sedation, the median duration of VR intervention was 30.5 minutes (IQR 23.5-46); 81.3% of the patients watched the videos until device implantation, 37.5% during the whole procedure. The VR intervention group reported significantly less anxiety after the procedure (VAS 2 [IQR 0-3.75] vs 5 [IQR 2-8], p=0.04) than patients randomised to control. In the intervention group, 93.8% would use VR during TAVI again. Nausea and vomiting did not occur more frequently compared to control. Conclusions: VR interventions during TAVI to assist conscious sedation are safe and feasible, even in very old and frail patients. In this small cohort, there was a significant reduction in periprocedural anxiety.",10.4244/EIJ-D-20-00269,"pubmed, wos",Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,clinical research; clinical trials; innovation; quality of life; TAVI,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-20-00269)
Virtual reality-based relaxation for enhancement of perioperative well-being and quality of life: protocol for a randomised pilot trial,Other,"Schrempf, MC; Petzold, JQ; Vachon, H; Petersen, MA; Gutschon, J; Wolf, S; Sommer, F; Murnauer, M; Anthuber, M",BMJ OPEN,2021,"Introduction Patients with cancer undergoing surgery often suffer from reduced quality of life and various forms of distress. Untreated distress can negatively affect coping resources as well as surgical and oncological outcomes. A virtual reality-based stress reduction intervention may increase quality of life and well-being and reduce distress in the perioperative phase for patients with cancer. This pilot trial aims to explore the feasibility of the proposed intervention, assess patient acceptability and obtain estimates of effect to provide data for sample size calculations. Methods and analysis Patients with colorectal cancer and liver metastasis undergoing elective surgery will be recruited for this single-centre, randomised pilot trial with a three-arm design. A total of 54 participants will be randomised at 1:1:1 ratio to one of two intervention groups or a control receiving standard treatment. Those randomised to an intervention group will either receive perioperative virtual reality-based stress reduction exercises twice daily or listen to classical music twice daily. Primary feasibility outcomes are number and proportions of participants recruited, screened, consented and randomised. Furthermore, adherence to the intervention, compliance with the completion of the quality of life questionnaires and feasibility of implementing the trial procedures will be assessed. Secondary clinical outcomes are measurements of the effectiveness of the interventions to inform sample size calculations.

Virtual rehabilitation in an activity centre for community-dwelling persons with stroke - The possibilities of 3-dimensional computer games,Not Multi User,"Broeren, J; Claesson, L; Goude, D; Rydmark, M; Sunnerhagen, KS",CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES,2008,"Background: The main purpose of this study was to place a virtual reality (VR) system, designed to assess and to promote motor performance in the affected upper extremity in subjects after stroke, in a nonhospital environment. We also wanted to investigate if playing computer games resulted in improved motor function in persons with prior stroke. Methods: The intervention involved 11 patients after stroke who received extra rehabilitation by training on a computer 3 times a week during a 4-week period. The control group involved 11 patients after stroke who continued their previous rehabilitation (no extra computer training) during this period. The mean age of all was 68 years (range = 47-85) and the average time after stroke 66 months (range = 15-140). The VR training consisted of challenging games, which provided a range of difficulty levels that allow practice to be fun and motivating. An additional group of 11 right-handed aged matched individuals without history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses served as reference subjects. Results: All the participants reported that they were novel computer game players. After an initial introduction they learned to use the VR system quickly. The treatment group demonstrated improvements in motor outcome for the trained upper extremity, but this was not detected in real-life activities. Conclusions: The results of this research suggest the usefulness of computer games in training motor performance. VR can be used beneficially not only by younger participants but also by older persons to enhance their motor performance after stroke. Copyright (C) 2008 S.

This fact has been no different during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, home care will need updates for this new pandemic context, prioritizing the provision of personalized guidance for family caregivers. Objective: To minimize the impact on the mental health of family caregivers of people with dementia through the virtual support group for family caregivers. Method: The research was developed from the performance of support groups for family caregivers in dementia in the virtual format. The meetings were weekly, lasting 2 hours and the themes were worked out according to the group's demands. All meetings were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results: In the 8 meetings, 10 family caregivers participated and 5 thematic categories were identified: technology; the routine in the COVID-19 pandemic; behavioral changes and their relationship with the caregiver's mental health; the support network as a health marker; and the new way of carrying out meaningful activities.

Virtual-reality-based cognitive behavioural therapy versus waiting list control for paranoid ideation and social avoidance in patients with psychotic disorders: a single-blind randomised controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Pot-Kolder, RMCA; Geraets, CNW; Veling, W; van Beilen, M; Staring, ABP; Gijsman, HJ; Delespaul, PAEG; van der Gaag, M",LANCET PSYCHIATRY,2018,"Background Many patients with psychotic disorders have persistent paranoid ideation and avoid social situations because of suspiciousness and anxiety. We investigated the effects of virtual-reality-based cognitive behavioural therapy (VR-CBT) on paranoid thoughts and social participation. Methods In this randomised controlled trial at seven Dutch mental health centres, outpatients aged 18-65 years with a DSM-IV-diagnosed psychotic disorder and paranoid ideation in the past month were randomly assigned (1:1) via block randomisation to VR-CBT (in addition to treatment as usual) or the waiting list control group (treatment as usual). VR-CBT consisted of 16 individual therapy sessions (each 1 h long). Assessments were done at baseline, after treatment (ie, 3 months from baseline), and at a 6 month follow-up visit. The primary outcome was social participation, which we operationalised as the amount of time spent with other people, momentary paranoia, perceived social threat, and momentary anxiety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial was retrospectively registered with ISRCTN, number 12929657. Findings Between April 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015, 116 patients with a psychotic disorder were randomly assigned, 58 to the VR-CBT group and 58 to the waiting list control group. Compared with the control, VR-CBT did not significantly increase the amount of time spent with other people at the post-treatment assessment. Momentary paranoid ideation (b=-0 . 331 [95% CI -0 . 432 to -0 . 230], p<0 . 0001; effect size -1 . 49) and momentary anxiety (-0 . 288 [-0 . 438 to -0 . 1394]; p=0 . 0002; -0 . 75) were significantly reduced in the VR-CBT group compared with the control group at the post-treatment assessment, and these improvements were maintained at the follow-up assessment. Safety behaviour and social cognition problems were mediators of change in paranoid ideation. No adverse events were reported relating to the therapy or assessments.

Although there is limited evidence, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown to be effective in improving FM symptoms. An alternative to enhance CBT effectiveness is to incorporate digital therapeutics (DTx).Aim We conducted a pilot study to investigate whether the addition of a DTx intervention (VirtualPain) to cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) can reduce pain perception and associated symptoms in patients with FM.Method Ten patients with FM were initially recruited from a public hospital in Barcelona. The treatment consisted of 6 weeks of VirtualPain group sessions and 16 weeks of CBGT. Measures of catastrophizing, self-efficacy, and coping were recorded before, during, and after the protocol. In the DTx sessions, pain intensity was recorded before and after each session.Results The program (DTx and CBGT) showed a significant improvement in pain-related self-efficacy and relaxation measures. Improvement in pain perception was observed only after the DTx intervention.Conclusions This study provides preliminary results regarding the added value of DTx (VirtualPain) as part of a CBGT for FM. The use of the program has facilitated a significant reduction in pain perception in each of the VirtualPain sessions, which provides further evidence of how this technology can be beneficial for improving FM treatments.",10.1177/20494637231210391,"pubmed, wos",Neurosciences & Neurology,cognitive-behavioral group therapy; digital therapeutics; fibromyalgia; group treatment; pain perception,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1177/20494637231210391)
Virtually supportive: A feasibility pilot study of an online support group for dementia caregivers in a 3D virtual environment,Good,"O'Connor, MF; Arizmendi, BJ; Kaszniak, AW",JOURNAL OF AGING STUDIES,2014,"Introduction: Caregiver support groups effectively reduce stress from caring for someone with dementia. These same demands can prevent participation in a group. The present feasibility study investigated a virtual online caregiver support group to bring the support group into the home. While online groups have been shown to be helpful, submissions to a message board (vs. live conversation) can feel impersonal. Method: By using avatars, participants interacted via real-time chat in a virtual environment in an 8-week support group. Result: Data indicated lower levels of perceived stress, depression and loneliness across participants. Importantly, satisfaction reports also indicate that caregivers overcame the barriers to participation, and had a strong sense of the group's presence. Discussion: This study provides the framework for an accessible and low cost online support group for a dementia caregiver. The study demonstrates the feasibility of interactive group in a virtual environment for engaging members in meaningful interaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Visual P300 as a neurophysiological correlate of symptomatic improvement by a virtual reality-based computer AT system in patients with auditory verbal hallucinations: A Pilot study,Not Multi User,"Liang, NN; Li, XR; Guo, XJ; Liu, S; Liu, Y; Zhao, WT; Wen, YJ; Li, Y; Li, J; Li, FY; Wu, HY; Li, JH; Li, QQ; Guo, JX; Xu, Y",JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH,2022,"Previous comparative trials showed that virtual reality (VR) therapies achieved larger effects than gold-standard cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on overall auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). However, no trial has examined the corresponding underlying electrophysiological mechanisms. We performed a pilot randomized comparative trial evaluating the efficacy of a virtual reality-based computer AT system (CATS) over CBT for schizophrenia (SCZ) patients with treatment-resistant AVHs and explored these potential electrophysiological changes via the visual P300 component. Patients (CATS, n = 32; CBT, n = 33) completed the clinical assessments pre- and post-interventions and at 12-week follow-up. The visual P300 were measured before and after both therapies. The analysis of changes in psychiatric symptoms used linear mixed-effects models, and the P300 response in temporal and time-frequency domains was analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance. There was no interaction effect between change in clinical symptoms and treatment group. However, several statistically significant within-group improvements were found for CATS and CBT over time. AVH improved significantly after both treatments, as measured with the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales-Auditory Hallucinations (PSYRATS-AH) sub-scores. Especially for the CATS group, omnipotence beliefs, anxiety symptoms, selfesteem, and quality of life also remained improved at the 12-week follow-up. Moreover, P300 amplitude had a significant interaction effect and correlation with AVH response. Overall, our analysis did not demonstrate general clinical superiority of CATS over CBT, but CATS improved refractory AVH in SCZ patients, likely by increasing P300 amplitude. These findings support the continued development of CATS for persistent AVH and suggest further trials to clarify the neurological effects of CATS.",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.04.027,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,Auditory verbal hallucinations; Psychological treatment; Avatar therapy; Virtual reality; Visual P300; Event-related potential,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.04.027)

Vulnerability of personality disorder during the Covid-19 crises - a multicenter survey of treatment experiences among patients referred to treatment,Other,"Kvarstein, EH; Zahl, KE; Stänicke, LI; Pettersen, MS; Baltzersen, ÅL; Johansen, MS; Eikenaes, IUM; Arnevik, EA; Hummelen, B; Wilberg, T; Pedersen, G",NORDIC JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY,2022,"Background The societal shutdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic involved mental health services for personality disorder (PD) and was introduced from 12 March 2020 in Norway. Rapid implementation of treatment modifications was required for patients typically characterized by insecure attachment and vulnerability to separation. Aim To investigate immediate reactions to the shutdown of services; alternative treatment received; and differences related to age in a clinical sample of patients with PD. Design A survey performed from June to October 2020 (after the first Covid-19 wave) among 1120 patients from 12 units offering comprehensive group-based PD programs. Results The response-rate was 12% (N = 133). Negative feelings of anxiety, sadness, and helplessness were noteworthy immediate reactions, but the dominating attitude was accommodation. Younger patients (<26 years) reported more skepticism and less relief. Modified treatment was mainly telephone therapy. Digital therapy was less available, but was more frequent among younger patients. A minority received digital group therapy. Most patients rated the frequency and quality of modified treatments as satisfactory in the given situation, but also worried about own treatment progress, lack of group therapy, and 47% missed seeing the therapist when having telephone consultations. Conclusion The survey confirms a radical modification from comprehensive group-based PD programs to telephone consultations, low availability of digital consultations and group treatments. Taking a short-term, first wave perspective, the survey indicates a noteworthy capacity among poorly functioning patients for accommodating to a clearly challenging situation, as well as considerable concern about treatment progress.",10.1080/08039488.2021.1934110,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,Personality disorder; Covid-19 crises; treatment experience,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2021.1934110)
Waiting Lists for Psychotherapy and Provider Attitudes Toward Low-Intensity Treatments as Potential Interventions: Survey Study,Not Digital,"Peipert, A; Krendl, AC; Lorenzo-Luaces, L",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Common mental disorders, including depression and anxiety, are leading causes of disability worldwide. Digital mental health interventions, such as web-based self-help and other low-intensity treatments (LITs) that are not digital (eg, bibliotherapy), have the potential to reach many individuals by circumventing common barriers present in traditional mental health care. It is unclear how often LITs are used in clinical practice, or whether providers would be interested in their use for treatment waiting lists. Objective: The aims of this study were to (1) describe current practices for treatment waiting lists, (2) describe providers' attitudes toward digital and nondigital LITs for patients on a waiting list, and (3) explore providers' willingness to use digital and nondigital LITs and their decisions to learn about them. Methods: We surveyed 141 practicing mental health care providers (eg, therapists and psychologists) and provided an opportunity for them to learn about LITs. Results: Most participants reported keeping a waiting list. Few participants reported currently recommending digital or nondigital LITs, though most were willing to use at least one for patients on their waiting list. Attitudes toward digital and nondigital LITs were neutral to positive. Guided digital and nondigital LITs were generally perceived to be more effective but less accessible, and unguided interventions were perceived to be less effective but more accessible. Most participants selected to access additional information on LITs, with the most popular being web-based self-help.

This has adversely impacted child development and wellbeing, particularly for children from priority populations (culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) and rural/regional communities) who are at an already increased risk of health inequality. The increased mental health and psychosocial needs were compounded by the closure of in-person preventive and health promotion programs resulting in health organisations embracing technology and online services. Watch Me Grow-Electronic (WMG-E) - developmental surveillance platform- exemplifies one such service. WMG-E was developed to monitor child development and guide parents towards more detailed assessments when risk is identified. This Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) aims to expand WMG-E as a digital navigation tool by also incorporating parents' mental health and psychosocial needs. Children and families needing additional assessments and supports will be electronically directed to relevant resources in the 'care-as-usual' group. In contrast, the intervention group will receive continuity of care, with additional in-person assessment and 'warm hand over' by a 'service navigator' to ensure their needs are met. Methods: Using an RCT we will determine: (1) parental engagement with developmental surveillance; (2) access to services for those with mental health and social care needs; and (3) uptake of service recommendations. Three hundred parents/carers of children aged 6 months to 3 years (recruited from a culturally diverse, or rural/regional site) will be randomly allocated to the 'care-as-usual' or 'intervention' group. A mixed methods implementation evaluation will be completed, with semi-structured interviews to ascertain the acceptability, feasibility and impact of the WMG-E platform and service navigator. Conclusions: Using WMG-E is expected to: normalise and de-stigmatise mental health and psychosocial screening; increase parental engagement and service use; and result in the early identification and management of child developmental needs, parental mental health, and family psychosocial needs. If effective, digital solutions such as WMG-E to engage and empower parents alongside a service navigator for vulnerable families needing additional support, will have significant practice and policy implications in the pandemic/post pandemic period.",10.1186/s12913-021-07243-0,"pubmed, wos",Health Care Sciences & Services,Child development; Parent mental health; Psychosocial needs; Screening; Developmental surveillance; Service navigation; Virtual care; Digital solution; Online health service; Electronic platform,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07243-0)
Way-finding during a fire emergency: an experimental study in a virtual environment,Not Multi User,"Meng, FX; Zhang, W",ERGONOMICS,2014,"The way-finding behaviour and response during a fire emergency in a virtual environment (VE) was experimentally investigated. Forty participants, divided into two groups, were required to find the emergency exit as soon as possible in a virtual hotel building because of a fire escape demand under condition 1 (VE without virtual fire, control group) and condition 2 (VE with virtual fire, treatment group). Compared to the control group, the treatment group induced significantly higher skin conductivity and heart rate, experienced more stress, took longer time to notice the evacuation signs, had quicker visual search and had a longer escape time to find the exit. These results indicated that the treatment condition induced higher physiological and psychological stress, and had influenced the escape behaviour compared to the control group. In practice, fire evacuation education and fire evacuation system design should consider the response characteristics in a fire emergency.

Digital storytelling is an arts-based, participatory methodology wherein individuals create and share their illness experiences in detailing their lived experiences.Objective: The study objective was to pilot-test a web-based digital storytelling workshop focused on endometriosis to understand storytellers' experiences of workshop participation. We assessed the feasibility of story cocreation and sharing, including the emotional impact of workshop participation, the acceptability of the workshop for the subject matter, and the storytellers' willingness to share their stories with broader audiences as a method for knowledge translation.Methods: This study used a community-based participatory methodology supplemented with patient-oriented research and integrated knowledge translation. Study participants, referred to as storytellers, cocreated 3-to 5-minute individual digital stories about their lived experiences of endometriosis during a web-based workshop (comprising five 2-hour sessions over 6 weeks) facilitated by The Center for Digital Storytelling. Data were collected through participant observations at the workshop, storyteller weekly reflective journals, and an end-of-workshop focus group interview with storytellers. These data were analyzed using a qualitative interpretive description approach.Results: A total of 5 women and 1 nonbinary storyteller aged 19 to 39 years who had experienced endometriosis for 4 to 22 years participated in the study. We characterized storytelling workshop participation and the acceptability of story cocreation by describing participants' experiences of opportunity, commitment, and connection; complex emotions that were healing; and a desire to share. Feasibility was demonstrated through 100% engagement in the workshops. All 6 storytellers reported feeling empowered by publicly sharing their cocreated digital stories through social media and the Sex, Pain & Endometriosis website.Conclusions: Despite the complexities of the story-building process, the workshop and the cocreation and sharing of digital stories were feasible. The storytellers found that this process allowed for emotional healing and personal empowerment by offering a unique way to talk about painful sex, which also facilitated a connection among those in the workshop.

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an evidence-based, trauma-focused psychotherapy that desensitizes painful memories, so that reminders in the present no longer provoke overwhelming emotional responses. Preliminary evidence suggests that EMDR can be used as an acute intervention in suicidal patients, including those with major depressive disorder. In addition, because of social distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have been using EMDR on the web and, in the absence of formal evaluations of web-based EMDR, informal reports indicate good results. Objective: The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate whether remotely delivered EMDR (targeting experiences associated with suicidal thinking) reduces suicidal thoughts. Secondary aims include examining the impact of remotely delivered EMDR on symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, emotional dysregulation, and dissociation. We will also report on adverse events in the EMDR group to explore whether targeting suicidal ideation with EMDR is safe. Finally, we will compare dropout rates between the treatment groups. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 80 adults who express suicidal ideation and meet the study criteria will receive either 12 sessions of twice weekly EMDR plus treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. EMDR sessions will focus on the most distressing and intrusive memories associated with suicidal ideation. Data for primary and secondary objectives will be collected at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months after enrollment. A subsequent longer-term analysis, beyond the scope of this protocol, will examine differences between the groups with respect to the number of posttreatment emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and overall health care use in the year before and after therapy. Results: The protocol was approved by the University of Alberta Research Health Ethics Board (protocol ID Pro00090989). Funding for this study was provided by the Mental Health Foundation (grant RES0048906). Recruitment started in May 2021, with a projected completion date of March 2023. Conclusions: The results of this trial will contribute to knowledge on whether web-based delivery of EMDR is a safe and effective treatment for reducing suicidal ideation and potentially reducing the incidence of suicide attempts in this patient population.",10.2196/30711,"pubmed, wos","Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",suicide; trauma; eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR); telemedicine; psychotherapy; digital health; eHealth; remote delivery; virtual care,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/30711)
Well-being app to support young people during the COVID-19 pandemic: randomised controlled trial,Population,"Thabrew, H; Boggiss, AL; Lim, D; Schache, K; Morunga, E; Cao, N; Cavadino, A; Serlachius, AS",BMJ OPEN,2022,"Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of 'Whitu: seven ways in seven days', a well-being application (app) for young people. Design Prospective randomised controlled trial of Whitu against waitlist control, with 45 participants in each arm. Participants 90 New Zealand young people aged 16-30 recruited via a social media advertising campaign. Setting Participants' homes. Interventions Developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and refined from a prototype version that was evaluated during a smaller qualitative study, 'Whitu: seven ways in seven days' is a well-being app that, as its name suggests, contains seven modules to help young people (1) recognise and rate emotions, (2) learn relaxation and mindfulness, (3) practice self-compassion and (4) gratitude, (5) connect with others, (6) care for their physical health and (7) engage in goal-setting. It can be completed within a week or as desired. Main outcome measures Primary outcomes were changes in well-being on the WHO 5-item Well-Being Index and Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale. Secondary outcomes were changes in depression on the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, anxiety on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale, self-compassion on the Self Compassion Scale-Short Form, stress on the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, sleep on the single-item Sleep Quality Scale and user engagement on the end-user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale and via qualitative feedback during an online survey. Outcomes were evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks (primary study endpoint) and 3 months, and analysed using linear mixed models with group, time and a group-time interaction. Results At 4 weeks, participants in the Whitu group experienced significantly higher emotional (Mean difference (md) 13.19 (3.96 to 22.42); p=0.005) and mental (md 2.44 (0.27 to 4.61); p=0.027) well-being, self-compassion (md 0.56 (0.28 to 0.83); p<0.001) and sleep (md 1.13 (0.24 to 2.02); p=0.018), and significantly lower stress (md -4.69 (-7.61 to -1.76); p=0.002) and depression (md -5.34 (-10.14 to -0.53); p=0.030), compared with the waitlist controls. Group differences remained statistically significant at 3 months for all outcomes. Symptoms of anxiety were also lower in the intervention group at 4 weeks (p=0.096), with statistically significant differences at 3 months (md -2.31 (-4.54 to -0.08); p=0.042). Usability of Whitu was high (subjective ratings of 4.45 (0.72) and 4.38 (0.79) out of 5 at 4 weeks and 3 months, respectively) and qualitative feedback indicated individual and cultural acceptability of the app. Conclusions Given the evolving psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, Whitu could provide a clinically effective and scalable means of improving the well-being, mental health and resilience of young people.

What Is the Impact of Engaging With Natural Environments Delivered Via Virtual Reality on the Psycho-emotional Health of People With Spinal Cord Injury Receiving Rehabilitation in Hospital? Findings From a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,Not Multi User,"Lakhani, A; Martin, K; Gray, L; Mallison, J; Grimbeek, P; Hollins, I; Mackareth, C",ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION,2020,"Objectives: This study investigated (1) the effect of engaging with 20-minute simulated natural environments delivered via virtual reality (VR) on current mood state and (2) the effect of engaging with multiple VR sessions over a period of a week on the depressive symptoms of people with a spinal cord injury (SCI). Design: Randomized controlled trial design. Setting: Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Unit in Australia. Participants: Participants (N=24) were assigned to a group engaging in VR sessions during week 1 (group 1, n=10) or week 2 (group 2, n=14). Interventions: The intervention week involved participation in up to three 20-minute VR sessions over 3 consecutive days. The control condition involved regular rehabilitation practice over a week. Main Outcome Measures: The Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) was completed prior to the first week (T1), after the first week and prior to the second week (T2), and after the second week (T3). Current feeling states, including depressed/happy, anxious/relaxed, and not feeling good/ feeling good, were rated immediately prior and after each VR session. Results: Levels of happiness, relaxation, and feeling good were significantly higher subsequent to engaging with each VR session. Between group differences in PHQ-8 scores were significantly greater for participants who experienced the intervention during the first week compared to participants within the control group: intervention participants had significant improvements in psycho-emotional health. Within-group PHQ-8 scores were reduced for each group subsequent to experiencing the intervention; however, differences were not significant. Conclusions: Engaging with simulated natural environments delivered via VR can favorably affect the psycho-emotional health of people with SCI receiving rehabilitation in hospital. Future research including larger samples and investigating the effect over a longer time period is required to confirm the findings presented.

What Works and What Doesn't Work? A Systematic Review of Digital Mental Health Interventions for Depression and Anxiety in Young People,Other,"Garrido, S; Millington, C; Cheers, D; Boydell, K; Schubert, E; Meade, T; Nguyen, QV",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,2019,"Background: A major challenge in providing mental health interventions for young people is making such interventions accessible and appealing to those most in need. Online and app-based forms of therapy for mental health are burgeoning. It is therefore crucial to identify features that are most effective and engaging for young users. Objectives: This study reports a systematic review and meta-analysis of digital mental health interventions and their effectiveness in addressing anxiety and depression in young people to determine factors that relate to outcomes, adherence, and engagement with such interventions. Methods: A mixed methods approach was taken, including a meta-analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials that compared use of a digital intervention for depression in young people to a no-intervention control group, and 6 comparing the intervention to an active control condition. A thematic analysis and narrative synthesis of 41 studies was also performed. Results: The pooled effect size of digital mental health interventions on depression in comparison to a no-intervention control was small (Cohen's d = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55), while the pooled effect size of studies comparing an intervention group to an active control showed no significant differences (Cohen's d = 0.14, 95% CI -.04 to 0.31). Pooled effect sizes were higher when supervision was involved (studies with no-intervention controls: Cohen's d = 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80; studies with active control: Cohen's d = 0.49, 95% CI -0.11, 1.01). Engagement and adherence rates were low. Qualitative analysis revealed that users liked interventions with a game-like feel and relatable, interactive content. Educational materials were perceived as boring, and users were put off by non-appealing interfaces and technical glitches. Conclusions: Digital interventions work better than no intervention to improve depression in young people when results of different studies are pooled together. However, these interventions may only be of clinical significance when use is highly supervised. Digital interventions do not work better than active alternatives regardless of the level of support. Future interventions need to move beyond the use of digital educational materials, considering other ways to attract and engage young people and to ensure relevance and appeal.",10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00759,"pubmed, wos",Psychiatry,children; adolescents; unguided self-help; self-management; low mood; prevention,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00759)

What do health providers and patients tweet about schizophrenia?,Not Multi User,"Hernandez, MY; Hernandez, M; Lopez, DH; Gamez, D; Lopez, SR",EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY,2020,"Aim Twitter is the most commonly used social media forum in public health and is considered the radio of the internet. Many health providers utilize this media to disseminate health information. Patient use of social media for mental health topics encourages providers to disseminate quality information and to develop virtual collaborative learning environments. This study explored trends in health information exchanged by patients, doctors and health organizations about schizophrenia through analyses of tweets posted using the #schizophrenia. Methods The likelihood that the information distributed by each user type was scholarly was assessed via qualitative and logistic regression analyses. Specifically, a sequential exploratory multimethod of data analysis guided this study with a sample of 981 tweets. Results Most tweets focused on the improvement of schizophrenia literacy (n = 366) followed by personal experiences/motivational stories (n = 207) and biological explanations of the disorder (n = 158). Logistic regression results indicated that compared to doctors, patients were less likely to tweet with a scholarly source (OR = 0.481, CI = 0.311, .744; P < .001). All users were less likely to include a scholarly source when tweeting about schizophrenia literacy, personal/motivational experiences, campaign/organizational events or illness management in comparison to those who tweeted about biological explanations of schizophrenia. Conclusion Results suggest all users disseminated beneficial information that can increase public schizophrenia literacy and illness management, while connecting individuals to organizational events targeting this debilitating disorder.

What do young women with obesity want from a weight management program?,Not mental health,"Crino, ND; Parker, HM; Gifford, JA; Lau, KYK; Greenfield, EM; Donges, CE; O'Dwyer, NJ; Steinbeck, KS; O'Connor, HT",EATING AND WEIGHT DISORDERS-STUDIES ON ANOREXIA BULIMIA AND OBESITY,2020,"Purpose Early adulthood is a high-risk time for weight gain; however, young women with obesity are difficult to recruit to weight management programs. To encourage participation and retention, it is important to understand what young women want from these programs. The purpose of the study was to explore participants' perspectives on the features of an ideal weight management program. Methods Semi-structured interview schedules were used to elicit information from eight focus groups [27 women; mean age of 29.1 (+/- 5.1) years, mean body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)) of 35.8 (+/- 2.9)]. The focus groups were transcribed, coded and analyzed qualitatively. Results The themes that emerged were program content, format, program characteristics, program name, location and duration. A major finding from the study is that participants value a program that includes nutritional, psychological and lifestyle interventions, and includes components that are not traditionally part of weight management programs such as body acceptance, sexual health and dressing and grooming. A program name that conveys wellness and body positivity was valued. Participants highlighted the importance of individualized programs that are also tailored to the needs of young adults, and delivered by credible and approachable staff who provide accountability. Cost-effectiveness, flexibility, accessibility, time-commitment were important considerations and the use of a combination of virtual and in-person methods (including group interventions) appealed to this cohort.

Women seafarers' health and welfare survey,Not Multi User,"Stannard, S; Vaughan, C; Swift, O; Robinson, G; Altaf, SA; McGarry, A",INTERNATIONAL MARITIME HEALTH,2015,"Background: This is a collaborative study from the International Maritime Health Association, International Seafarers' Welfare and Assistance Network, International Transport Workers' Federation and the Seafarers Hospital Society. The aim of the study was to look at the health and welfare needs of women seafarers and how organisations can best make or campaign for improvements to the health information and services available to women seafarers. Materials and methods: A pilot study was conducted in July 2014 and following review of the data and revision of the questionnaire the study was launched in December 2014, running until the middle of March 2015. Results collected from the survey are also supported by qualitative data obtained from two focus groups run during February and March. Results: 595 responses were received from a range of nationalities, ages and positions on board ships. The findings suggest that joint/back pain, stress/depression/anxiety and headache seem to be the most common symptoms reported by women seafarers and that 55% felt that they are related to their work. 48% state that they have problems with seeking medical care and offer suggestions to improve this. Routine wellness checks, nutrition and information on joint and back pain are the main areas that women seafarers stated health screening/services/information would be most useful to improve their health and wellbeing. They suggested this could best be received directly from health professionals, or alternatively by reading leaflets or from online websites/an app. Significantly 37% of women seafarers also stated that they do not have access to sanitary bins within the toilet and 18% say that sexual harassment is an issue. Conclusions: The responses received highlight a small number of areas where relatively simple and low-cost interventions might improve the health and welfare of women seafarers. Specifically these include the production and appropriate, distribution of gender -specific information on back pain, mental health and nutrition in addition to gynaecological complaints, to all women seafarers; the introduction of means for disposing of sanitary waste for all female crew on all ships and the improved availability of female specific products e. g. sanitary products in port shops and welfare centres worldwide. Additional work is needed to investigate these areas more fully and to look at the issue of confidence in medically trained staff, medical confidentiality and sexual harassment. Any further work and interventions will require the support of all of the main stakeholders and we plan a briefing meeting to publicise the findings to date and to identify support for further work in this area.",10.5603/IMH.2015.0027,wos,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",women seafarers' health and welfare needs,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.5603/IMH.2015.0027)
Women's Preferences and Design Recommendations for a Postpartum Depression Psychoeducation Intervention: User Involvement Study,Not Multi User,"Siddhpuria, S; Breau, G; Lackie, ME; Lavery, BM; Ryan, D; Shulman, B; Kennedy, AL; Brotto, LA",JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,2022,"Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity, affecting up to 18% of Canadian new mothers. Yet, PPD often remains untreated due to numerous barriers in access to care, including location and cost. Development of eHealth interventions in collaboration with patient partners offers an exciting opportunity to fill this care gap and provide effective and affordable care to new parents across British Columbia. Objective: Our aim was to determine the content and design preferences of women previously diagnosed with PPD to inform changes to the development of a web-enabled intervention for education and management of PPD. Methods: Webpage prototypes were created to mimic the web-enabled resource using findings from completed focus group research that assessed what women want in a web-enabled support resource for PPD. A convenience sample of women aged >18 years and previously diagnosed with PPD was recruited. Feedback was collected on the content and design of the prototypes via semistructured interviews and online surveys. Qualitative, inductive analytic, and quantitative methods were used. Results: A total of 9 women (mean age 37.2 years, SD 4.8 years) completed the interview and a majority of the survey. The following 6 themes were identified: (1) inefficacy of text-heavy layouts, (2) highlighting key information, (3) clarity/understandability of the language, (4) finding support groups, (5) validation and immediate help for feelings of isolation, and (6) helpfulness and accessibility of the resource. Each theme identified elements of content or design that were either effective or may be improved upon. Most women (8/9, 89%) favored content relating to foundational knowledge of PPD, such as symptoms and management options. The layout, language, and content were found to be generally easy to understand, clear, trustworthy, and helpful. Conclusions: Six key areas were identified by women previously diagnosed with PPD, as requiring focus in a web-enabled psychoeducation program.

Participants completed standardized self-report measures of outcome expectancy at the first session, of the working alliance at each session, and three measures of social anxiety symptoms at pre- and post-treatment. The working alliance did not mediate the relation between outcome expectancy and symptom improvement across time points, dependent measures, and treatment type. Bayes factors were calculated for the relation between the working alliance and symptom reduction, while controlling for outcome expectancy and therapist effects. Results were inconclusive.

Despite its growing evidence, there is a need to unravel the complex learning process in order to ensure high quality of interprofessional education delivery. Aim: This study aimed to explore the experiences of healthcare students and facilitators on the use of 3DVW for interprofessional team-based virtual simulation. Methods: Interprofessional teams, each comprising six different healthcare students (Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, and Medical Social Work) and two clinicians who acted as facilitators, logged into the 3DVW from their own remote locations to participate in team-based care delivery that included an interprofessional bedside round and a family conference. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted on a purposive sample of 30 healthcare students and 12 facilitators using focus group discussions and individual interviews. Results: Four themes emerged from their experiences: the wow experience, authentic experience on collaborative care, ease of learning, and preeminent role of the facilitator. The simulation provided the wow experiences through contextual, collaborative and experiential learning approaches. Despite technical challenges, the participants were wooed by the comforts of learning from home and the psychological safety in virtual environment. The facilitators played a critical role in optimizing learning engagement to win learners over. Conclusion: Our study explicates how attention to the wow, woo and win trilateral factors can transform the interprofessional learning experiences offered by 3DVW simulation.

Xbox Kinect™ based rehabilitation as a feasible adjunct for minor upper limb burns rehabilitation: A pilot RCT,Not mental health,"Voon, K; Silberstein, I; Eranki, A; Phillips, M; Wood, FM; Edgar, DW",BURNS,2016,"Introduction: Rehabilitation following bums is integral to improving physical and psychological outcomes. Interactive video game consoles are emerging as therapeutic adjuncts due to their ease of use, affordability, and interactive gameplay. The Xbox Kinect (TM) has advantage over similar consoles, with controller free interaction utilising three dimensional motion capture software. Player movements during gameplay have been shown to be comparable to completing daily tasks and therefore the Xbox Kinect (TM) has potential for use as a rehabilitation tool. Aim: The objectives of this pilot study were to compare the efficacy of the Xbox Kinect (TM) with conventional physiotherapy as an adjunctive tool to promote activity and, to explore their efficacy in influencing functionality and pain. Method: A randomised controlled clinical trial design was used. Intervention group participants were asked to complete two daily 30 min exercise sessions consisting of 15 min of self-directed physiotherapy exercise followed by 15 min of Xbox Kinect (TM) activities, based on location of bum. Control group participants were asked to complete two daily 30 min exercise sessions of self-directed physiotherapy exercises involving two 15 min sets of exercises, standardised for location of bum. Participants were recruited for a maximum of 7 days. Outcomes assessed included daily activity time, treatment satisfaction, upper limb disability, pain, and self-reported fear of movement (kinesiophobia). Results: A sample of 30 bum patients admitted to Royal Perth Hospital was randomised into intervention and control groups. The intervention group demonstrated significantly greater total activity time compared to control group (median 49.4 and 26.7 min respectively, p < 0.0001), irrespective of total bums surface area (TBSA). Significantly greater satisfaction scores were also demonstrated in the intervention group compared to controls (median 8.53 vs 7.8 respectively, p < 0.0001). There was no evidence to support differences between group measures for upper limb disability, pain and fear avoidance of movement. Conclusion: The Xbox Kinect (TM) is a useful tool in increasing rehabilitation exercise time and patient satisfaction compared to conventional physiotherapy without indication of concurrent negative effects on patient recovery.

This may be partly attributed to systemic barriers resulting in lower rates of help-seeking, sub-optimal identification of psychological challenges, and undertreatment. Reducing these barriers within health systems is an important factor in reducing the Social and Emotional Wellbeing (SEWB) health burden on young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Objectives In partnership with Miwatj Health Aboriginal Corporation (Miwatj), this project will co-design an integrated youth Social and Emotional Wellbeing (SEWB) and mental health stepped care model for remote Aboriginal communities in the north east Arnhem region of the Northern Territory. Design A collaborative research approach using co-design methods will underpin a community-centric stepped care allocation method, to which culturally appropriate SEWB and mental health interventions and treatments are assigned. These components of the project will inform a digital platform which will facilitate access to SEWB care for young people in north east Arnhem land. This concept was co-developed in a partnership between researchers and Miwatj and builds on Miwatj's previous work to map the stepped needs of young people. The co-design of the content and features of these outputs will be facilitated through community participation and overseen by community, health, and cultural governance structures.

YouTube Videos to Create a Virtual Hospital Experience for Hip and Knee Replacement Patients to Decrease Preoperative Anxiety: A Randomized Trial,Not Multi User,"O'Connor, MI; Brennan, K; Kazmerchak, S; Pratt, J",INTERACTIVE JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH,2016,"Background: With declining reimbursement to health care systems, face-to-face time between patients and providers to optimize preoperative education and counseling may be challenging. Objective: Because high patient anxiety prior to surgery has been linked to more severe and persistent pain after joint replacement surgery, the Orthopedic Surgery Department at Mayo Clinic in Florida created a playlist of 16 YouTube videos aimed at creating a virtual hospital experience for primary total hip and knee joint replacement patients. A randomized trial was then performed to evaluate the potential impact of viewing this playlist on preoperative anxiety. Methods: Each patient completed a Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) score assessment at the time of the routine preoperative clinic visit and then randomized based on his/her gender, type of surgery, and initial GAD score to either the control group of standard education (education at face-to-face clinical visits as well as printed educational materials) or the treatment group (standard education plus access to the YouTube playlist). On the morning of the patient's surgery, the same survey was repeated. Of the 65 patients who consented to participate in the study, 53 completed the study (82%) with 28 of 29 (97% completed) in the control group and 25 of 36 (69% completed) in the treatment group. Results: Overall, the results showed a trend toward less anxiety in patients who viewed the YouTube videos; this was exhibited by a reduction in the median GAD score by 1 point. This trend is more clearly present in patients with high preoperative anxiety (predominantly women), as seen in the reduction of the median GAD score by 6 points in the treatment group. Conclusions: Although our experience is limited, our results indicate that a series of tailored videos may decrease patient anxiety preoperatively. We recommend further exploration of both this concept and the use of social media tools in preoperative patient education.",10.2196/ijmr.4295,"pubmed, wos",Research & Experimental Medicine,hip arthroplasty; hip replacement; knee arthroplasty; knee replacement; preoperative anxiety; virtual hospital experience; YouTube videos,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.2196/ijmr.4295)
Young people's experience of online therapy for first-episode psychosis: A qualitative study,Good,"Valentine, L; McEnery, C; O'Sullivan, S; D'Alfonso, S; Gleeson, J; Bendall, S; Alvarez-Jimenez, M",PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY-THEORY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,2022,"Objectives This study aimed to understand how young people with first-episode psychosis experienced online therapy on a Moderated Online Social Therapy (MOST) platform known as Horyzons. Methods Semi-structured in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 young people who had previously participated in Horyzons, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a long-term digital intervention for first-episode psychosis. Interviews were analysed using a phenomenological approach. Results This study found that the online therapy experience for first-episode psychosis was idiosyncratic, taking on different meaning for different users. The relatively fixed therapeutic content led to experiences that included on-demand help-seeking, positive distraction, revision, generalization and translation, and normalization. We also found that although the experience of online therapy was motivating to some, it was overwhelming for others. Conclusions The self-directed and flexible nature of the Horyzons online therapy gave some young people a sense of welcomed control over their mental health journey, and others felt overwhelmed by the high level of choice. Feeling overwhelmed by the level of choice appeared to interrupt their engagement with the platform, and thus their overall ability to use the intervention meaningfully. We also found that on-demand help-seeking and positive distraction were two functions unique to young people through online therapy and may have been related to the significant reduction in the number of overall presentations by young people to emergency departments and psychiatric admissions in the intervention group of the Horyzons RCT. Practitioner points Young people used online therapy for on-demand support to help deal with distress. Young people used online therapy to distract themselves from distress in a positive way. Some young people valued the flexibility of online therapy, which increased their motivation to engage with it. Some young people were overwhelmed by the amount of choice available to them via online therapy, which decreased their motivation to engage.",10.1111/papt.12356,"pubmed, wos",Psychology; Psychiatry,digital health; digital intervention; first-episode psychosis; online therapy; social media-based intervention; therapy; young people; youth mental health,URI::(https://www.doi.org/10.1111/papt.12356)
Zero Self-Harm app: a mobile phone application to reduce non-suicidal self-injury-study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Not Multi User,"Guerrero, E; Andreasson, K; Larsen, L; Buus, N; Larsen, JLS; Krogh, J; Thastum, R; Lindberg, L; Lindblad, K; Erlangsen, A; Nordentoft, M",TRIALS,2024,"BackgroundNon-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a growing healthcare problem. Individuals with NSSI have an increased risk of suicidality. Due to stigma, they may self-injure in secret, which means they might not seek help until events have escalated to include suicidal ideation or a mental disorder. Interventions delivered via mobile phone applications (apps) have been linked to reductions in self-injury. This protocol outlines a trial, which examines whether the Zero Self-Harm intervention, consisting of an app for people with NSSI, can reduce the number of NSSI episodes, suicide ideation, and depressive symptoms.MethodsThe trial will be conducted as a 6-month 2-arm, parallel-group, multicentre, pragmatic, randomized clinical superiority trial. The intervention group will receive the app and instructions on how to use it, while the control group will be allocated to a waitlist and allowed to download the app after 6 months. After inclusion, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome is the number of NSSI episodes during the preceding month, as measured at the 6 months follow-up with the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory. A total of 280 participants, 140 in each arm, will be included.DiscussionThis trial will assess the effectiveness of the Zero Self-Harm intervention to reduce the number of NSSI episodes. If effective, the app will have the potential to support a large group of people with NSSI. Considering the stigma related to NSSI, the fact that the app may be used in private and anonymously might make it an appealing and acceptable option for support. The app was developed in collaboration with people with lived experiences related to current and/or previous NSSI. As a result of this, the app focuses on minimizing harm, rather than stopping NSSI. This might enhance its utilization.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04463654.

Online digital care and coaching such as Zoom-delivered GROW (Z-GROW) coaching may be an invaluable approach to building resilience and improving well-being. This study investigated the effectiveness of the Z-GROW coaching model in enhancing self-reported well-being in a sample of school administrators in South-East Nigeria. Method: A randomized control trial was conducted with a sample of 109 school administrators who met the inclusion criteria. Participants were allocated into Z-GROW (N = 55) and waitlist control (N = 54) groups. A 2-hour Z-GROW programme was delivered to the Z-GROW intervention group weekly for 9 weeks. Subjective wellbeing was measured using the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE), and the Flourishing Scale (FS). Data were collected on three occasions: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up using the same measures. All data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The presentation of data was supported by figures and charts. Results: Results revealed that school administrators' three dimensions of subjective well-being significantly improved following the Z-GROW intervention. It was further shown that the improved state of participants was sustained through a 3-monthfollow-up assessment. Conclusion: Based on the findings, it can be concluded that intervention using GROW coaching in the zoom platform improves the self-reported well-being of school administrators. The outcomes of this study present the Z-GROW model as a viable intervention for subjective well-being and other mental health conditions among school administrators.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of a tablet-based cognitive rehabilitation program on cognitive performance, cognitive complaints, fatigue, and psychological distress in primary brain tumor patients following neurosurgery. Also, attrition, adherence and patient satisfaction with the program were evaluated. Methods Adults with presumed low-grade glioma and meningioma were recruited before surgery. Three months thereafter, participants were allocated to the intervention group or waiting-list control group using minimization. The 10-week eHealth app ReMind, based on the effective face-to-face intervention, consisted of psychoeducation, strategy-training and attention retraining. Performance-based cognitive outcomes and patient-reported outcomes were assessed before surgery and 3, 6 and 12 months thereafter. Mean scores, percentages of cognitively impaired individuals and reliable change indices (RCIs) were compared between groups. Results Sixty-two out of 183 eligible patients were randomized. Of the people who declined, 56% reported that participation would to be too burdensome. All participants found a tablet-app suitable for delivery of cognitive rehabilitation and 90% rated the program as good or excellent. Performance-based cognitive outcomes and patient-reported outcomes did not significantly differ in group means over time nor RCIs between the intervention (final n = 20) and control group (final n = 25).

Expectations range from overcoming structural barriers to access in low-income countries to more effective, interactive treatment of chronic conditions. Before medical health practice supported by mobile devices (mHealth) can scale up, a number of challenges need to be adequately addressed. From a psychological perspective, high attrition rates, digital divide of society, and intellectual capabilities of the users are key issues when implementing such technologies. Furthermore, apps addressing behavior change often lack a comprehensive concept, which is essential for an ongoing impact. From a clinical point of view, there is insufficient evidence to allow scaling up of mHealth interventions. In addition, new concepts are required to assess the efficacy and efficiency of interventions. Regarding technology interoperability, open standards and low-energy wireless protocols appear to be vital for successful implementation. There is an ongoing discussion in how far health care-related apps require a conformity assessment and how to best communicate quality standards to consumers. Apps Peer-Review and standard reporting via an App synopsis appear to be promising approaches to increase transparency for end users. With respect to development, more emphasis must be placed on context analysis to identify what generic functions of mobile information technology best meet the needs of stakeholders involved.

Caring for children with ALL is challenging for parents. A mobile health (mHealth) supportive care intervention was developed to meet parents' needs. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the potential effectiveness of this mHealth supportive care intervention on emotional distress, social support, care burden, uncertainty in illness, quality of life, and knowledge. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental pre- and postdesign study from June 2015 to January 2016. In total, 101 parents were enrolled in the study, with 50 in the observation group and 51 in the intervention group. Parents in the observation group received the standard health education and were observed for 3 months. Parents in the intervention group received the mHealth supportive care intervention, in addition to the standard health education. The intervention consisted of 2 parts-an Android smartphone app Care Assistant (CA) and a WeChat Official Account. The CA with 8 modules (Personal Information, Treatment Tracking, Family Care, Financial and Social Assistance, Knowledge Center, Self-Assessment Questionnaires, Interactive Platform, and Reminders) was the main intervention tool, whereas the WeChat Official Account was supplementary to update information and realize interaction between parents and health care providers. Data of parents' social support, anxiety, depression, care burden, uncertainty in illness, quality of life, their existing knowledge of ALL and care, and knowledge need were collected before and after the 3-month study period in both groups. For the intervention group, parents' experience of receiving the intervention was also collected through individual interviews. Results: Overall, 43 parents in the observation group and 49 in the intervention group completed the study. Results found that the intervention reduced parents' anxiety (Dint(Post-Pre)=-7.0 [SD 13.1], Dobs(Post- Pre)=-0.4 [SD 15.8], t(90)=-2.200, P=.03) and uncertainty in illness (Dint(Post-Pre)=-25.0 [SD 8.2], Dobs(Post-Pre)=-19.8 [SD 10.1], t(90)=-2.761, P=.01), improved parents' social function (Dint(Post-Pre)=9.0 [SD 32.8], Dobs(Post-Pre)=-7.5 [SD 30.3], t(90)=2.494, P=.01), increased parents' knowledge of ALL and care (Dint(Post-Pre)=28.4 [SD 12.4], Dobs(Post-Pre)= 17.2 [SD 11.9], t90=4.407, P<.001), and decreased their need for knowledge (Dint(Post-Pre)=-9.9 [SD 11.6], Dobs(Post-Pre)=-1.9 [SD 6.4], t(90)=-4.112, P<.001).

Though comorbidity increases the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality, most clinical interventions target these diseases separately. Increasing physical activity might be effective to simultaneously lower depressive symptoms and improve glycaemic control. Self-management apps are a cost-effective, scalable and easy access treatment to increase physical activity. However, cutting-edge technological applications often do not reach vulnerable populations and are not tailored to an individual's behaviour and characteristics. Tailoring of interventions using machine learning methods likely increases the effectiveness of the intervention. Methods and analysis In a three-arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the effect of a text-messaging smartphone application to encourage physical activity in low-income ethnic minority patients with comorbid diabetes and depression. The adaptive intervention group receives messages chosen from different messaging banks by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The uniform random intervention group receives the same messages, but chosen from the messaging banks with equal probabilities. The control group receives a weekly mood message.

momHealth: A Feasibility Study of a Multibehavioral Health Intervention for Pregnant and Parenting Adolescent Mothers,Good,"Wambach KA, Davis AM, Nelson EL, Snow K, Yungmeyer A, Muzzy R, Romero K, Murray M.",Kans J Med,2021,"Introduction: In 2016, 209,809 babies were born to mothers 15 - 19 years of age, for a live birth rate of 20.3 per 1,000 in this age group. Many health issues surround adolescent mothers and their infants, many of which can be addressed through behavioral change. The main purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and relevance of momHealth, an innovative multiple health behavior change (MHBC) education and support mHealth intervention, focused on breastfeeding, healthy eating and active living, and depression prevention among pregnant and parenting adolescents. We also evaluated the proposed online surveys and physical outcome measures for feasibility and acceptability (burden, time, ease of use).

Methods: A one-group quasi-experimental longitudinal design was used to examine the intervention components and the breastfeeding, diet/activity, and depression outcome measures. Nine iPad-delivered education modules, text messaging, and virtual individual and group support were provided for 12 weeks, beginning at 32 weeks of pregnancy, with follow-up to three months postpartum. Data on the main behaviors and outcomes were collected at three in-home visits, one telephone call soon after birth, and ten postpartum weekly and biweekly online surveys.

Results: Although recruitment and attrition presented challenges, six participants enrolled in the study during prenatal clinic visits; all were pregnant with their first child, single, and had a mean age of 17.7 years (SD = 1.4). Intervention participation ranged from 59% to 91% for educational module completion, text message reading, and individual virtual support meetings and three virtual peer support groups were held. Intervention acceptability, relevance, and delivery was supported by reports of clear and relevant content, reasonable time burden, iPad ease of use, and acceptable intervention length. Data collection was reported as convenient and non-burdensome, but the diet recall method and activity monitoring challenged some.

Conclusions: This was the first MHBC research in adolescent pregnant women designed to improve breastfeeding outcomes, healthy eating/active living, and depression prevention. Findings demonstrated strengths and challenges of the interventions and methods, support feasibility and acceptability of momHealth, and informed the recruitment and intervention protocols of our pilot randomized trial.
